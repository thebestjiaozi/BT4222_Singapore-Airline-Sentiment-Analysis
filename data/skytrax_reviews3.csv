2019-12-01,9,9,"""service is impeccable""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Singapore. A fantastic flight with great food. The drinks selection was extensive. I had Umeshu but was disappointed there was no sake. The satay and Pate appetizers welcomed me to Singapore before I arrived in SG. The service is impeccable, and we are known by our names. Will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."
2019-11-30,1,1,"""Very poor communication""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. A mechanical problem with the plane after shifting our gate to a half hour walk away from the original. They go into total chaos, total ineptness. No other plane available. They do not shift passengers onto their other flight, another plane, or other airlines. Four hours later, they send a new plane from Singapore. So six hours delay. The hand writing up of food vouchers for the layover was also quite humorous for 200 passengers. Very poor communication at all times, not even answering direct simple questions. With the checkin process, more than 12 hours living in the airport."
2019-11-28,10,10,"""amazing experience for us""","Not Verified | Johannesburg to Christchurch via Singapore. An amazing experience for us as first time passengers with Singapore Airlines The staff is very friendly and professional, dressed and groomed very well. Their communication with passengers makes is a real feel good experience. Their endless efforts were to keep all passengers comfortable and happy The plane was very clean and hygienic. The entertainment for long flights was top quality and a huge variety is available Right from boarding, wet hot cloths provides to stepping off the plane was a 10/10 experience. Keep it up."
2019-11-27,10,10,"""helpful staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Cairns via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Great service, helpful staff and lovely food with good movies. A staff member helped me a lot while in the boarding pass queue which was great. Good people, good food."
2019-11-27,5,5,"""my experience was far from being positive""","✅ Trip Verified | I have flown SQ a few times before, but find that the current A350 economy class seats are very uncomfortable, at least for a 6' person like me. BLR-SIN was a short haul flight which was even more tightly packed, SIN-MEL was marginally better. MEL-SIN was an older B777, which was far better than the new gen 350s in terms of economy class seats. I had booked SFML, but in every flight ended up getting a piece of tasteless, overcooked fish just dabbed with some tomato sauce - a big difference from my previous experience with seafood meal a few years ago. I do not think I will go for this option any more on Singapore Airlines. The flights were on time, the crew helpful, but overall my experience was far from being positive."
2019-11-26,10,10,"""quick, friendly and precise""","✅ Trip Verified | Milan to Singapore. Singapore Airlines generally runs a tight ship. Service is quick, friendly and precise and they may be the only airline I’ve flown with that offers hot towels to economy passengers (though it’s pretty standard for premium economy). The premium economy seats are well equipped with large seatback displays, large windows, and comfy leather seats, and the food is decent. Nice of them to have a legrest and footrest on the seats and I’m pleased to say most flights were quite punctual. Check in was quick and easy, and planing/deplaning was efficient. Cabin crew exercised caution when assisting guests with stowing luggage in the overhead bins, and they periodically passed by with refreshments"
2019-11-24,5,5,"""my seat not functioning""","✅ Trip Verified | I usually fly Qantas but chose to fly Singapore Airlines this time, I flew Premium economy. Would I fly again, probably not. My first flight resulted in my seat not functioning and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable compared to Scoot (adjoining flight). Service, the female hostesses were fabulous but the male staff were shocking."
2019-11-22,6,6,"""quite disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | Bengaluru to Brisbane via Singapore. I have been travelling with Singapore Airlines for several years now. I have never had a bad experience ever. The last time we flew, however, was quite disappointing. I observed 2 things - 1) we always order Indian meals and have been satisfied always, but and the quality of the meals this time was quite bad. The first meal was a tasteless serve and the second one was of 3 Quiches (since when are quiches Indian meals?). And they were bad anyway. Furthermore, on the return trip, my wife received 3 oily and smelly Samosas. Who serves 3 samosas in one sitting? What is the chef thinking? 2) the staff while polite was not involved as they usually are. In my experience, Singapore Airlines makes a very conscious attempt to connect with travellers. They aim to make you as comfortable as possible, however, this time there was a non-commital attitude which was very unlike them. I had to ask for water more times then I can remember. Earlier it was always served in intervals because they were prompt. No feedback form was shared too. My child always receives some small talk with the staff and a little gift. This time there was no attention and no gift either."
2019-11-20,6,6,"""The food on this flight was awful""","Not Verified | I have to admit to a huge disappointment on flying economy class with this airline. The outward trip on the A380 was extremely comfortable, flight attendants good but food was awful, something I wasn’t expecting having read about the excellent quality of their meals. My main grumble was the return flight on a 777, I have to say that the seat pitches couldn’t possibly have been the 32” advertised on Skytrax. I am 6ft tall and my knees were touching the seat in front and reclining made little difference as the person in front was fully reclined. I can fully understand how a sardine must feel! The food on this flight was awful, totally lacking in taste. Now I know that some people reading this review will say that if I want more room then fly premium economy or business class, something I would love to do if it was affordable! All in all, flight attendants were wonderful, food was awful and the 777 was diabolical. Sorry Singapore Airlines I won’t be flying with you again other than on a A380."
2019-11-17,1,1,"""disappointed with the food""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Dubai. I was disappointed with the option of foods during flights. We were asked by the FA to choose between chicken sandwich and Hamus with flat bread so I chose the chicken sandwich since I am not a fan of Hamus but it wasn’t available anymore so the FA insisted if I could have the Hamus instead. I just had a cup of coffee. And also I have also asked for water twice during that flight but nothing was given to me. It made me think that they gave only minimal attention to economy passengers.
2019-11-17,10,10,"""maintained its excellent standard""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines maintained its excellent standard on this 5-hour flight. A pillow and blanket were available on the seat when we boarded. The cabin was clean and despite the flight being nearly full, it was still a very good experience. Furthermore, the legroom of the seat was excellent and the seat was very comfortable. The tray table was wide and sturdy, and there was sufficient storage with a nice pocket for my phone and nice pouches for me to put things in. There was a wide selection of movies available as well. The cabin crew were as usual, excellent and provided great service. A meal service was provided for this red-eye flight, and my Chicken meal was good. Despite being delayed on departure, we arrived in Shanghai on time. SIA’s newest product on the 787 is indeed very well designed and the flight was very good overall."
2019-11-16,5,5,"""decor bland and functional""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. First I flew in SQ and experience the lounges in both Sydney and Melbourne this month. I must say it's the worst experience I have ever had. Running out of food, decor bland and functional (barely) at best, staff sombre and angry. It is tragic for SQ to sell itself as a premium airline with such tired conditions. All in all disappointing experience on SQ"
2019-11-15,9,9,"""premium economy is a good choice""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to New York. My experience on this flight was good overall. Check-in, boarding processes were well organized. Food tasted better than business class offerings on some other airlines. Singapore airlines' premium economy is a good choice for flights between 6 and 10 hours."
2019-11-13,6,6,"""with low cost carrier Scoot""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Trivandrum via Singapore. I booked this flight under SIA and was not expecting they would code share a full service fare ticket with low cost carrier Scoot on SIN -TRV sector. SIA is charging the same amount in fare as compared to previous years while they code shared with Silk Air which is a full service airline. There was no option for basic seat selection and was served instant fried rice topped with meat and peas. They served a bottle of water and no option for tea/coffee or soft drinks. Silk Air served beer and spirits . I understand why SIA is resorting to this sort of behaviour at the expense of passenger comfort, profits and making use of the monopoly they enjoy on this route. Shameful for an airline which advertises itself as ""Great Way to Fly"". SIA should make amends to passengers who were made to fly on Scoot SIA - TRV route."
2019-11-10,8,8,"""appreciate the staff service""","Not Verified | Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore. I appreciate the staff service and co-operation. I lost my wallet on airport and airline staffed approached me and offered their best help. I would like to thank them especially Mr Ebrahim, one of the crew members, who updated me with each and every action that was taken for searching my wallet."
2019-11-10,9,9,"""met my expectations fully""","✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Brisbane via Singapore. I've been intending to try Singapore Airlines for some time and was keen to know if the reality matched the star rating. The quality of the product, seat and service onboard and on the ground met my expectations fully. The only slight quibble, and it is very slight, is that no amenity kit or pyjamas are offered in business class. The usual amenity kit contents are available as individual items, however in the bathrooms. The seat was excellent, food met expectations and was better than many others. The IFE offering was a little disappointing however and they ought to make a bigger effort here."
2019-11-09,10,10,"""needs competently met and exceeded""",Not Verified | Los Angeles to Singapore. Our outbound flight experience was enhanced and made pleasant by the service and conversation with Kelvin. Our needs were competently met and exceeded. Our return flight was equally satisfying by the personal attention shared to us by Beverly. A lengthy flight of 15.5 hours felt relaxing and enjoyable because of her care in customer service. Amazing comfort and travel. We will gladly recommend Singapore Airlines.
2019-11-09,6,6,"""barely offer water to people""","✅ Trip Verified | Colombo to Sydney via Singapore. I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess in my cabin were pretty rude. It's like they just want to get their job done and they don't care about the people. I've travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely. They barely offer water to people. I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i can't. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn't on the menu. I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn't last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream! And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup). On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. I'd ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles."
2019-11-07,10,10,"""Great service in business class""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Amsterdam. Great service in business class. The seats are comfortable and the sky bed opens flat for a good night’s sleep. The timing of this flight is great because it leaves at midnight and by the time dinner is served, it is between 2 to 3 am. This gives some adjustment to jet lag and arrives in Amsterdam in the morning. I started sneezing due to sinuses and the air stewardess promptly gave me a large pack of tissues, which came in handy. The entertainment selection was good - although I think Qatar is more current in terms of movie selection. Book the cook never fails. My bak chor mee came with vinegar on the side. For breakfast, I had the healthy red rice fish porridge, which doesn’t sound great but is really amazing. I started off to a busy work day well thanks to Singapore Airlines."
2019-11-06,9,9,"""Overall, a good flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. A pleasant flight with decent leg room and good entertainment. Meals are not bad, although this is my 3rd time having the same dish in the last month - not sure how often the menu changes. Service is good. There was 2 pre-meal drinks runs plus the lunch, followed by after meal drinks. Overall, a good flight for 5 hours - although it was starting to get a bit uncomfortable by then."
2019-11-06,6,6,"""crew were not efficient""","Not Verified | We flew Singapore Airlines business class on an A350 Brisbane to Tokyo via Singapore. The meals on the Brisbane to Singapore were as normal not interesting but the Singapore Tokyo flight the bento box was 5 star. The flight crew were great. The Osaka flight on a B787 again the bento box was 5 star and all the crew helpful and understanding to everyone. The B787 in business class the seats were smaller than usual and the plane was noisy than the A350. The flight home Singapore to Brisbane, a passenger heard the crew talking that they rush the meals and turn off the lights. Well after take-off they were no drinks supplied but a rushed meal service which was not interesting (why do they not do a meal service that they do from other capitals). They did not even supply bottles of water after the meals service like on other flights. This crew were not efficient."
2019-11-05,8,8,"""a pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to New York, everything was organized and on both way aircraft was spotlessly clean. A380 configuration offers privacy even in economy class by dividing the cabin into sections. I would recommend the upper deck because of seat density and less engine noise. The legspace is okay but then I am a tall person. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served was of good quality though I believe they should make the main course portions larger, as EK does. Nothing was too much trouble for cabin staff and they made flight a pleasant experience by looking well after us. This flight reiterated my belief that SIA is the best!"
2019-11-02,1,1,"""not recommend this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Christchurch via Singapore. London to Singapore great service, enjoyable trip. I cannot say the same about Singapore to Christchurch. I had a 12 hour stopover in Singapore, loved the Silver Kris Lounge. Had a long walk to gate D10 but was good to shake off a little fatigue, but I was more than ready to sleep. I was most impressed with the 19K cubicle but saw no bedding. After takeoff I asked a hostess where do I get a blanket?"" she reach up and seemed to grasp one from somewhere. I had a fitful night and Journey with just a blanket and the cushion that was on the seat and could not settle. When the lights came on for breakfast I saw the guy across from me, fold up his bedding and seat! I asked the hostess why she had not showed me how to operate the bed, she replied ""its on the Video""! I told her as I could not operate the TV system how would I know that? I told her I would lay a complaint, I also talked to the man I assumed was in charge, he admitted he had seen me trying to rest/sleep, and assumed I slept like that! I have flown other airlines in Premium economy that took care of the elderly so much better, but as I decided this would be the last visit to the UK to see my sister before she forgets me, she has dementia, I decided it treat myself to business class return home, I had heard good things previously. I have to say, this was a very disappointing end,to a sad journey for me. I certainly would not recommend this airline."
2019-11-01,7,7,"""economy service in premium economy""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Johannesburg. Daylight flight on A350 in premium economy. Checking-in and boarding was quick and efficient, with a warm welcome on-board, as is the norm with Singapore Airlines. There is generous locker space in premium economy, sufficient to allow blankets, pillows etc not immediately required to be stowed. Drinks and nuts were served shortly after take off, with champagne offered, but unfortunately served in a tiny plastic faux champagne glass. We had ordered lunch from book the cook. The quality was good, but would be so much better if served on proper plates and not in foil dishes. It is unfortunate that Singapore provide only economy service in premium economy. Drinks were offered with the meal, but again served in small plastic tumblers. Wine was simply red or white, and of mediocre quality. No refills were offered, and when trays were collected some time later a requested refill never materialised. With a good choice of entertainment and a comfortable seat the 11 hour flight seemed to pass quite quickly. The crew came round on a number of occasions with water and fruit, and a second hot meal was provided 2 hours before landing. Overall it was a very pleasant flight. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, and the A350 is a very nice aircraft. However it is unfortunate that the enhanced level of service expected in premium economy is not provided."
2019-10-31,2,2,"""boarding pass in two compartments""",✅ Trip Verified | Dhaka to Sydney via Singapore. My seat was in block 5 (seat no 61G and that of my wife was in Black 4 (seat no 46D). We must give heartfelt thanks to the lady who issued these two boarding pass. We must congratulate her as she was kind enough to issue boarding pass in two compartments though there were enough opportunity to issue boarding pass in one compartment and side by side. The performance of that staff I should say most unprofessional and unskill. I found the staff engaged to support wheel chair in Changi airport behaved unprofessional.
2019-10-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | In June, I flew in first from Los Angeles to Manila return via Singapore. Everything was top notch. Cabin crew are delightfully interactive and helpful. The flat bed seats are so wide. The entertainment screen is large. The selection of films is marvelous. The food is scrumptuous. The Lalique branded amenity kit and sleepwear are divine. The first class Star Alliance lounge in LAX is quiet, private, and offers a menu to order from. The Private Room within the first class lounge at Singapore Changi Airport feels so exclusive and also offers a great food menu."
2019-10-28,3,3,"""not provide the vegetarian food""","✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to Bangalore via Singapore. Their own staff suggested me to change flight which I agreed. But in the new flight, they did not provide the vegetarian food I had ordered in advance. I did not expect them to provide the same variant I ordered. I was told that they will provide any other vegetarian option. The cabin crew refused to make any adjustments. Zero empathy and rude behaviour of the cabin crew makes it worthless to fly this airlines again. Cramped seats in the aircraft A350-900 in economy seats keeps reminding you that you are in cattle class."
2019-10-27,9,9,"""experience was fabulous""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Frankfurt. This was my first time flying in Singapore Airlines business class. The experience was fabulous from beginning to end. Lounge experience was a bit disappointing, but that seems to be a thing at JFK for most non-hub carriers (SQ uses partners' lounge as the airline doesn't have one at JFK). The A380 was bit old, but clean with ultra-wide seats. Service and catering were excellent."
2019-10-27,5,5,"""I expected much more""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Check in area was chaotic to say the least and I had to label my own baggage prior to drop off. The Kris Lounge is a shared lounge and it was bursting at the seems, basically no seating, therefore had to go to local coffee shop. The service onboard was not what I expected from a 5 Star airline like Singapore Airlines. I would put the service down to being pretty poor and with an old aircraft to match. The only really good thing I can say was that the Wi-Fi was good. I expected much more from Singapore Airlines considering they are 5 Star and have recently won the coveted Skytrax Award for best airline."
2019-10-25,5,5,"""service is nothing to shout out about""","✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Singapore. It was my first time taking SIA, and was not a memorable one. The inflight service is nothing to shout out about. Seating comfort is average. Cabin crews were not that warm, they are just doing their job. The in-flight entertainment is so-so. Non-english movies come without English subtitle. My biggest frustration is the quality of food. I am Muslim and pre-ordered the Muslim special meal. On SIN-HND route, as we flew at night and it was mid-long haul, we were given snack around 2 hours after departure. I was just served a piece of cake while the others got a sandwich. However, the crew was kind enough to offer me a vege sandwich. While flight en route HND-SIN, was more surprising. I got on board around 9.15am, and we had lunch served around 4.5 hour after departure, without being served snack. They offered us peanuts and juice 2 hours after departure. All in all, I do not find SIA is accommodating enough but they offer good price for the ticket."
2019-10-23,6,6,"""getting more disappointing over time""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. SQ is getting more disappointing over time. This is my 2nd flight in a week that is delayed by an hour (my last was late by 90 minutes). SQ used to be reliable and comfortable. In today’s delay of 55 minutes, nobody bothered to walk around to give anyone water or juice. After take off, pre-dinner drinks service no longer comes with the trolley. Passengers have a choice of water, juice or beer from the tray. When did SQ downgrade it’s drink service to European standards? Cabin service overall was good. Food is average. However, the cost cutting measures of SQ is highly visible. I still have a few more business class flights booked till the end of the year but with such bad reliability in schedule, I am switching after this year."
2019-10-19,9,9,"""Service was inconsistent""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. Flight was due to depart late, but the delay was further compounded at the airport due to cargo unloading. In the end, we departed over 90 minutes after the original time. For some reason, safety video was loud in the economy cabin and then turned up even louder. We had to cover our ears. Service was inconsistent - most cabin staff were good, one was particularly curt. We arrived in Singapore with only 30 minutes to the time our connecting flight departed. The ground staff tried really hard to get us into the connecting flight - but the Malaysia Airlines counter was closed and we missed our flight because we could not get our boarding passes. We were rebooked onto a SilkAir flight the next morning with hotel vouchers to stay at the Crowne Plaza, plus dinner and breakfast included. SQ also contacted the hotel to extend their buffet opening hours to 11pm to accommodate us. Despite the frustration of missing a flight, Singapore Airlines delay management team has done very well to make things smooth. We still felt looked after having missed a flight. The delay management staff who helped us out was very impressive."
2019-10-17,3,3,"""Very poor service in business class""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Manchester. Very poor service in business class. I have flown SQ business class many times before but this is the first time I have experienced such terrible service. Was particularly disappointed with the food and beverage service, and availability of cabin crew. I had requested Thai chicken curry and rice for supper, but changed my mind and requested the FA to wake me up for breakfast. I woke up just as they were serving breakfast and I requested breakfast. About 20 min later, one of the FA's served my the Thai chicken curry and rice. I was a bit shocked and told her that I requested breakfast, not supper, to which she replied they can serve only one meal to pax, and since I hadn't eaten this for supper, they brought it to me for breakfast. What? Only one meal in business class on a 13h 30m flight? And they say normal breakfast (you know toast, cereals and orange juice) is not available? Absolutely ridiculous. Not acceptable, especially in business class. Also, once they served supper (or breakfast), they went into the galley/crew rest area and never came out, and during the entire 13h 30m journey they did not even offer water to any of the pax. Again, this is not acceptable, not anywhere, let alone business class. Extremely disappointed with SQ, really did not expect them to be so lax. Will be flying the competition from now on, they just lost a customer."
2019-10-17,2,2,"""service has really gone downhill""","✅ Trip Verified | I don't understand why people say SQ is the best airline in the world. The service has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. I was traveling with my 10 month old daughter and husband on the non-stop from Singapore to LA (round trip). The flight attendants don't pay attention to details. They say they will wash baby bottles, but they hand back the bottle with milk still in it. So I had to request to wash the bottles myself (thankfully they allowed this). We ordered the ""Book the Cook"" meals, but the flight attendant didn't look up our info so they tried to serve us regular meals. When I told them we ordered ""Book the Cook"" meals they asked us what we ordered. I couldn't remember. Between the two of us that's 8 meals on 2 different flights that I booked in advance. If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that. They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline. When we boarded the plane, there was no bottled water in the water holders. Overall, it was just underwhelming. The price wasn't too bad considering it was Economy Plus and a non-stop flight to LA. I think the airline has good ideas, they just are executed properly by their staff."
2019-10-15,8,8,"""Service still lives up to its name""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth with Singapore Airlines. Upon boarding, I was surprised at how close the seats were. The screen was very close to my face, which wasn’t very comfortable. The windows are new - no screens, but simply dim according to 1 of 6 settings. Even in economy, we have a USB charging port, which is a plus. Food was average. We had a choice between a western and an Asian dish. The servings were generous, and we ate from a tray with metal utensils - which is a big plus considering the number of airlines that feed us out of cupboard. Entertainment was relatively good - although not as good as Qatar Airways selection. Service still lives up to its name. Given the price of economy class, this was a decent enough ride for 4.5 hours."
2019-10-14,9,9,"""Service is the best""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Singapore. Great food. Entertainment is ok. They have many Hollywood movies. Service is the best. Because I didn’t eat much, the stewardess asked if they could give me something else. Will definitely fly again."
2019-10-12,8,8,"""do not seem to be committed to premium economy""","✅ Trip Verified | Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable. Overall the flight was good, with a superb crew, and it is unfortunate that SQ do not match other airlines with their premium economy service."
2019-10-11,1,1,"""I was disappointed with the seat""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Singapore. I was quite excited about flying the Singapore Airlines A350 in Premium Economy class. I chose the bulkhead (an additional $130 USD over the regular Premium Economy fare) as my seat. I was disappointed with the seat. It was barely wider than an Economy Class seat, the leg rest might as well be non existent (it only extends about 3 inches), and there’s no dedicated lavatory for Premium Economy. Not to mention, the meals and cabin service are the same as Economy. Their so called Noise Canceling headphones aren’t noise canceling at all. I will pay extra for Premium Economy on EVA or Air Canada, but never again on Singapore Airlines."
2019-10-10,10,10,"""I will fly Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Brisbane. Cabin crew ensure you’re having the best experience. I missed getting an amenities kit as I had gone to use the lavatory. After mentioning this to a FA he went to get one however they had run out. So he tracked down every individual item, even going to business class for it to make sure I’d get a kit. The services are excellent; you get two hot towels, a blanket and a pillow, snacks and more. The seats are reasonably comfortable for economy and the in flight entertainment is expansive. The toilets are cleaned and stocked with dental kits. While more foot room and further reclining seats are always desirable, that’s never going to change in economy class. I will fly Singapore Airlines again."
2019-10-10,10,10,"""very impressive flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Stockholm to Moscow. Swift boarding. Clean and bright economy class cabin, very comfortable seat. Impeccable service. Very tasty and lavish (for such a short flight) breakfast (s. photo). No wonder the airline keeps being ranked so high in all reviews. Overall impression: very impressive flight with a pleasant aftertaste. Bravo!"
2019-10-10,4,4,"""each time is a little worse""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Melbourne. I have taken SQ many times and each time is a little worse than the flight before. This flight was on time and passengers were boarded according to section. I was lucky that there was a spare seat between myself and the guy with the aisle seat. Once we took off, the passenger in front reclined (day flight) and it sure makes economy feel so squeezy. Unlike their promise on the website that you won’t be packed like sardines, you are. I can’t eat fish but I guess SQ decided to save money by incorporating all allergies. My breakfast was gluten free (revolting hard dry roll), no dairy and no sugar. I was appalled by it compared to the normal breakfast. I am glad I brought snacks like chocolate and cookies. The selection of entertainment was fine and the toilets are kept clean. However paying so much more to go with SQ I expected the standards to be maintained not reduced. I think I will only base future travel on price as this so called great airline is not so great."
2019-10-09,10,10,"""crew very friendly""",✅ Trip Verified | Stockholm to Moscow return. Check-in at Stockholm airport quick with very friendly staff; boarding fast; crew very friendly and polite; aircraft very clean with nice seats; entertainment system has a lot of choice with new movies. Amount of food was not much but enough for this short flight. We arrived one hour late at Moscow Domodedevo airport due to a technical problem on the previous flight. I would definitely recommend flying with Singapore Airlines and I think that this is the best carrier.
2019-10-08,5,5,"""my worst Economy flight ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Adelaide. I dont know what happened to Singapore Airlines but just had my worst Economy flight ever. I am on the tall side with over 1.90cm but have had no issues on this flight over the decades on A310/A340/777/A330 in Eco and the occasional Biz class. My 1st time on their new A350-900 with their new economy seating and will be my last. The legroom is non existent. My knees were in constant contact with the seat infront. If the person infront of you decides to recline then you get to enjoy the screen about 20cm from your face. The seats are an absolute nightmare. Not only is the pitch terrible but also the width which is a complete joke. If you are travelling with a family member then fine otherwise you get to enjoy constant shoulder rubbing with your neighbour. The seat padding is the hardest i have come across. Having flown Thai's A350-900 the weekend before to Bangkok in standard eco seat as well and having no issues, I was looking forward to the SQ experience. What an incredible let down that was. The Thai product is so much better which is something i would have thought I would never say when comparing to SQ. Even Emirates a few months before in Economy was an absolute joy in comparison. The inbound flight was a 23:10 departure and our dinner consisted of a beverage and a packet of peanuts before lights were turned off. 4 hours later breakfast was served which consisted of yoghurt, a bit of fruit, bread roll and flavourless noodles or omelette. Not being able to sleep, you had to play catch the crew walking past if you wanted water. Not being heavyset, the tray actually pushed into my stomach when folded out which was also a new experience. On the return leg I managed to get the extra legroom seat in row 55 which was fine legroom wise but it was even more narrow then the standard seat as the tray folds out of the armrest taking up width. Compared to the standard economy seat this one is bearable for the 7 hours but again, not for anything longer. Whilst boarding and scanning the ticket the ground staff in ADL remarked"" oh, I am glad you got that seat as you are tall"". Whilst on board and having settled into the seat, the steward's pre-empted my seat neighbour's and my comment with ""yeah i know, they are very narrow"" so I can imagine the number of complaints about their seats. My neighbour and I, whilst trying to avoid shoulder contact had a lengthy discussion about how terrible these SQ seats have become. I will be exploring other carriers and connections in future as the premium paid for Singapore Airlines is simply not there anymore. Reading the number of gripes on the web about their Biz seats as well, I will be sure to choose other carriers in the future which saddens me as have been flying Singapore Airlines my entire life and had them in the highest regard until now but wont be enduring this torture ever again. I have absolutely no idea how they were voted best airline again."
2019-10-03,8,8,"""deterioration in the level of service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Was disappointed with the level of service as my grandson wasn't served the entree and my husband who had pre-ordered his ""Ramen"" main meal was served it cold and has to ask for it to be heated. Fail to understand how in business class staff can fail to serve one of the courses particularly when my family members were seated in the second row from the front. Overall on my earlier flight from Rome to Singapore the service was okay, not outstanding. I have flown numerous times Business Class in the last 5 years and I have noticed a deterioration in the level of service."
2019-10-01,3,3,"""they gave us seafood instead""","✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to Singapore. I asked for a Vegetarian meal, but they gave us seafood instead. The fish is covered by pasta so we didn’t notice until my wife took a bite. Complain to one of the flight attendants, they said sorry, which to me isn’t enough. This is the 2nd time happens to me, not happy. Shouldn’t trust SQ that much."
2019-10-01,10,10,"""Cabin crew were amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Outstanding service from check-in to landing on both Canberra to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney flights. My husband injured his foot in Singapore and the staff arranged for us to be moved to front row seating where more leg room was available. In addition, they arranged for a wheelchair at both ends. Cabin crew were amazing; thank you Singapore Airlines."
2019-10-01,1,1,"""was disappointed again""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Delhi. After having the experienced the most arrogant crew ever on an SQ Business Class I have chosen Star Alliance Alternatives such as Asiana and ANA for my recent flights and I have not been disappointed at all, but for my flight to India, there was not viable option, so I went back to SQ and was disappointed again. They are dropping standards. The 2 passengers besides me had to suffer dropping water from the overhead cabinets without any solution, my food was lousy, I found the legroom below the standard of above mentioned airlines. The booking procedure is like a low cost where they are charging up to 10% of the total ticket price for a front row seat. All this from an airlines which was by all means the Best Airline in my flight experience, just a few years back."
2019-09-30,1,1,"""found it very unprofessional""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. Cabin crew refused to ask passenger in front of me to pull the chair backup when he served meals. I found it very unprofessional. I asked to speak to his supervisor, he then gave in to ask the front seat passenger to pull his chair up for me to have my meal. No more Singapore Airlines. I got the connected flight from Singapore to Nepal on SilkAir and to my surprise, before even handed my meal, the cabin crew asked the front seat passenger to pull up his chair for me to have my meal. I am not special, they have done that to everyone passenger."
2019-09-29,2,2,"""Extremely disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Colombo to Bali via Singapore. Extremely disappointed by the service provided by each cabin crew members of each flight, very arrogant and rude to passengers, basically they didn’t care about the requests made by myself and by other members who flew with me. Our expectations were very high on this airline, but it’s not worth the money we spent on, seriously will not recommend or fly on this airline hereafter."
2019-09-28,1,1,"""a very overpriced disappointing experience""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Jakarta with Singapore Airlines. Disappointing aircraft. The crews are fine. But not necessarily showing great service. Further the mobile apps of the airline was down and most of the time I couldn’t check in online. Bad experience overall. Expensively priced which makes it a very overpriced disappointing experience.
2019-09-26,6,6,"""expected it to be much better""","✅ Trip Verified | Christchurch to Bangkok via Singapore. Was upgraded from Premium Economy to Business for first leg, and flew Economy on second. First time flying Singapore and for the most part I was satisfied, but expected it to be much better. The hard product was fine, comfortable business class seats, good food and plenty of IFE options. Service could use improvement, had a short connection in Singapore but the gate number was not provided until about 1 hour before landing. After ""running"" to the gate, there was no plane or staff there, not even any signage informing of new gate. Had to search on my phone only to find out it was changed to opposite side of the terminal. Again had to run to new gate and boarded just in time."
2019-09-25,9,9,"""provide an excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines provide an excellent service. I arrived late to the airport, and of course this was my mistake, but Singapore Airlines moved me to the next flight without me paying any extra charge. One thing that must be corrected is the attitude of their ground staff at Hong Kong Airport (HKG), which is a little less friendly to serve passengers, even though there is only one staff like that but the adverse effects can be comprehensive. But I still thank Singapore Airlines for giving me new tickets for free even though the late arrival to the airport was purely my own fault. All cabin crew on this flight were very friendly. Wide legroom and of course the inflight entertainment as always was up to date. I can only recommend to fly with Singapore Airlines. and for me, of course I will fly again with them."
2019-09-24,8,8,"""service was almost perfect""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Jakarta to Hong Kong on September 19, 2019. The service was almost perfect. where the flight is very timely, excellent service from the cabin crew, wide space between seats. The only thing that is less comfortable in this aircraft is that entertainment on board still uses a remote system which makes operating the monitor more difficult than current full service airlines which almost all use a touch screen system. but for the whole, I really recommend you to fly with Singapore Airlines."
2019-09-23,5,5,"""No personalised service""","Not Verified | The check-in process is always a breeze. This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that's about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I've been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don't need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can't SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don't offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays."
2019-09-22,10,10,"""Everything went smoothly""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore. Everything from check-in, boarding, cabin service, baggage handling, meals, seats went smoothly on this return flight which we had to book at extremely short notice for a family emergency (booked the flight less than 12 hours hours before departure). The call centre and airport staff did everything they could to sort out our vegetarian meals, and provide a wheelchair for my elderly aunt that travelled with me. Singapore Airlines is generally one of the cheaper options on this route which we travel on quite frequently but I would spend that extra money even if it’s not the cheapest option. No WiFi on any flights."
2019-09-20,6,6,"""cabin crew was rushing""","✅ Trip Verified | . Seoul to Kochi via Singapore. My flight from Kochi to Singapore on SilkAir was very good with enough leg space and tv, food option was just satisfactory, but I appreciate the before flight food pack they gave. Singapore to Seoul was okay, almost on par with Kochi to Singapore but bigger flight (I found silk air have better leg space than Singapore airlines. But return was very disappointing. Seoul to Singapore things except food was on par, but cabin crew was rushing, they gave me less than 2 min to use wet wipes and was eager to collect it back even before I used. Singapore to India worst service, even before they start they were left with veg food and non veg food they asked me but I didn't get it, though my seat was in 1st 15 seats. Toilet just a pair of toilet at back and front toilet though free reserved for business class seats, they didn't let me use it as economy class passenger. There was no TV on return flight and used mobile app to view their movies, limited food option and lack of consistency in service makes me not go on this airline unless to a route that has Singapore as destination for good service and flights are generally scheduled for it Air Asia though less options has better food choices or at least 1-2 very good choices to buy. Advantages Flight Date change possible for very low fee, which I did. Luggage 30kg very useful. Very quick service Definitely gives 6-10 rating no comparison to other top airlines."
2019-09-16,1,1,"""The damage is already done""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Very disappointed. The cabin service was fine, the flight was uneventful. I went to a great deal of time and trouble with Singapore Airline Officials in setting us up 6 months in advance with a seat choice that would accommodate my elderly mother being close to the lavatory. More than one phone call was made in a bid to secure a satisfactory response for this return and the outgoing flight on June 5. We ended up so far from where we wanted to be that the contempt I have for Airline Officials is significant. How on earth does an elderly infirm woman make her way to the back row when the walking device she uses is not allowed to come with her. I repeated many times that we would need an Aisle Chair, yet this was noticeably absent each time we boarded. Only after holding up the boarding, did an Aisle chair become available. I was so incensed after the first flight that I contacted SIA and told them what I really thought and their reaction for the return flight confirmed my long-held belief that this airline is only after my money and once that was in their possession - anything goes. Well I am not going to forget the battles I have had and the ignorance and contempt their administration has demonstrated on every occasion. They have lost me. The in-flight Service cannot override my sentiments. Do not bother if you are anything but a passenger who is happy to hand over your money and accept great service when your basic requests are treated so poorly. The Admin team is inept and say ""Yes"" to every request yet failed to deliver. The cabin crew could not believe the admin ignored me until I showed them the emails. But it is no good to say sorry as the apology is inflammatory given the disadvantage that my mother was placed in, and not to mention the inconvenience to others which I dutifully tried to avoid. The damage is already done."
2019-09-15,1,1,"""bitter resentment on my part""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London. Incredibly inept Admin. I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding, it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing. There is little their superb in-flight service did to improve the bitter resentment on my part. I expected much better after the initial discussions, I got contempt."
2019-09-12,9,9,"""Excellent service""","Not Verified | Mumbai to Singapore. Great Flight, departed/arrived on time. Excellent service. The hard product was the older seat which was significantly worse than the newer ones. This is because the A330s will be retired soon and replaced with Boeing 787 and A350s. I would advise that if possible you catch the A380 flight which leaves around the same time as it would be a better choice in my opinion especially if travelling in business class. Paid roughly 470 SGD for a return ticket which is a great price."
2019-09-07,8,8,"""love the aircraft""","✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Singapore. Always love the aircraft that SQ use for this route, the Business Class seat super bulky and comfort instead of modern and lacking comfort. Love it!"
2019-09-07,8,8,"""Warm hospitality""","✅ Trip Verified | Bali to Singapore. As always SQ know how to run an airline business. Warm hospitality and I will always take with them for Southeast Asia route, always keep up the nice work!"
2019-09-06,8,8,"""service offered was perfect""","✅ Trip Verified | Between Singapore and Kansai, Singapore Airlines operates night and day flights, night flights being one Boeing 787-10 that was grounded (Rolls-Royce engine troubles) at the time of my reservation. I had to move to day flight with 10 years old A330. Obviously there was a strong seat difference, but rest of service offered was perfect. From lounge to quick luggage delivery, delicious meal, and a great beverages offer."
2019-09-06,10,10,"""What an experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Delhi. Bid for an upgrade so was thrilled it had been accepted. What an experience. My seat was 94A, a beautiful comfortable seat. My wonderful FA Celestine looked after me so well. The food was special but I stopped at the third course. The turbulence was a little harsh so my bed was made for me to nap. I was offered camomile tea. This was an experience I’ll never forget. I have flown business before a few times but experienced nothing like this level of comfort and care. Just wowed me."
2019-09-04,9,9,"""best airline I’ve flown""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Istanbul via Singapore. Blown away by how amazing Singapore airlines is. Food was great for airline food, and the staff were amazing. Even though there were some annoying people on second leg being really rude and unreasonable (demanding coffee when water was being served, insisting they get to move seats because they were cold and yelling when staff told them they couldn’t) - the staff were courteous even though the customers were being so rude. Also the online service via email is fast and super helpful. They are simply the best airline I’ve flown."
2019-09-04,10,10,"""Wonderful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Wonderful experience with Singapore Airlines. Once entering aircraft was greeted by friendly cabin crew who showed me to my seat, came around and gave me headphones and eye shades. With my status, I was given a whole row to myself and the crew gave me business-class quality hot towel and headphones. The aircraft, being 15 days old at the time of flying, had a fast touchscreen monitor. The toilets were stocked with free amenities, including toothbrush and toothpaste. Crew took my order first, food choices sweet and sour pork or steamed fish. I chose the pork, was so delicious. Delicious Turkish pide, couscous salad, and bread roll. I was also given an activity pack (although really not for my age still a nice touch), which featured a deck of cards and some crayons. KrisWorld lounge was a bit crowded even at midnight, with a stream of people waiting to connect. The seat was plush and featured adjustable headrest, footrest and much more. Probably my favourite are the little storage pockets you will find under the seat - one is shaped perfectly for your passport and phone, and the other for your boarding pass and immigration cards. However the WiFi is very overpriced, cannot believe that they are charging $20 for some 100MB of data- Scoot is cheaper at $18. Would also have liked to see some more new and blockbuster movies on the iFE, was a bit disappointed."
2019-09-02,9,9,"""Service is excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Amsterdam. Wonderful experience. With book the cook, I got my laksa which was creamy and tasty. The skybed opens flat and allowed for a decent 8hours sleep. Service is excellent. I managed to get a good selection of Sulwhasoo on the flight at prices even better than the airport. Throughout the flight, requests were filled within minutes. Will definitely fly again."
2019-09-02,9,9,"""a great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | This was a great experience from San Francisco to Singapore. The seat was very comfortable, and had a generous 8 inches of recline. There was also a nice reading light next to the seat. The TV screen was huge and itwas really responsive. There was also a nice footrest. If you choose a window seat from rows 40-44, you get a huge compartment for storage. This was SQ33 and had only business and premium economy seats. An hour after take off the first meal was served, and I chose the Korean beef short rib. This was really good. I used the online Book the Cook to choose the meal, which was a great service. The menu also included an amenity kit with some really soft eye mask, a toothbrush, a comb, and some socks on request. In the back at the galley there was a self serve snack bar. Also there are 2 free checked bags with SQ premium economy. They served some snacks in the middle of the flight for those who were still awake, and I got an apple. They also handed out water bottles in the beginning of the flight, which was very generous. Then in the morning I got breakfast, some noodles and pork, and that was really good. The selection for the TV was really nice too, and it included a ton of Marvel including endgame."
2019-09-02,9,9,"""service was top-notch""","✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Singapore. Unfortunately SQ uses LH services & lounges in MUC. Senator lounge service was extremely poor. We did not feel welcome neither at arrival, neither inside. Wines (of low quality) are not in self-service, quantity served in glasses are severely controlled and personnel (when present) showed agressivity to all customers. Food was inedible (overcooked minced pork), with no other choice. Wi-Fi did not work well. Bad service could also be testified at boarding where LH personnel showed bad mood and did not respect the usual SQ procedures with obvious privileges for their Miles &More passengers. On the other hand we were pleased by the new seats on A350. Plane is fabulous, service was top-notch. We did not want to leave that plane. It is shocking to see that both airlines are quoted 5 stars. LH has a long long way to go to get there."
2019-09-02,9,9,"""a comfortable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. My seat was a single seat by the window. The seat fully reclines and a little enclave under the monitor allows legs to be fully stretched out (for short people like me). Overall, a comfortable flight with good entertainment and plenty of food. I was even able to get Umeshu on the flight. Service is excellent and the complimentary WiFi service tied me through 5 hours on WhatsApp."
2019-08-31,10,10,"""I was very impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Singapore. I was very impressed how the team of Singapore airlines crew SQ335 28th August 2019 looked after me during the flight. They were so professional and kind. I had a migraine and the staff even went and got my husband with out me knowing from Premium. I couldn’t speak highly enough of Yoshi, Raimond, Andrea & all the team. I can’t thank them enough."
2019-08-31,1,1,"""unable to select the seat""",Not Verified | We have flown multiple times via Singapore airlines and on each occasion we have had an issue of some kind usually related to seats and Singapore ground staff. Despite complaints directly to the airline I always feel I am wasting my time so I might as well go public with a review. The cabin is nearly always nice and the service is generally good although I have previously been left unable to eat as the only food left has been noodles with prawns and I have an allergy to prawns. On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin. To be effectively told tough luck for a $5000 seat is just not acceptable. Unless you are flying alone I would not recommend Singapore airlines. They are totally inflexible in everything they do and do not have any understanding of passenger needs.
2019-08-31,8,8,"""efficiency and reliability""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. Boarding was efficient and strictly adhered too which was great especially when some passengers tried to barge in. Economy is quite tight especially when the person in front reclines immediately for the whole flight. You have to recline yourself then otherwise your screen is right in your face. Was surprised not to get hot towels before take off and before landing. I guess cost cutting? No big deal but it used to be a nice touch. The toilets were kept clean with toothbrushes/paste sets in there, lotions ... that’s always nice. The flight attendants were run off their feet on this full flight but were still charming and sweet. The food probably was not as nice as my previous flights with them, the snack was awful. Again, its economy and expectations are never high. My advice is to bring your own snacks. Entertainment options were very good and we arrived in Singapore early too. I love SQs efficiency and reliability, friendly FAs and cleanliness."
2019-08-31,8,8,"""service still excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Singapore. Surprisingly, they only have one meal to offer for this flight on Aug 25, no other choice. Nevertheless, the service is still excellent with the stewardess being very attentive to my call and request."
2019-08-30,6,6,"""a disappointing flight""","✅ Trip Verified | We travelled from Singapore to Auckland in seats 41A and 41B with extra legroom. The seats were bulkhead and were okay. However, I have a complaint about passengers bringing on too much luggage as they call these seats last when you get on the plane. All the overhead lockers are full of other passengers bags - we had to put our luggage at least 6 compartments down from where we were sitting. A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal. Why on earth do they give you a flash menu if they can't serve you what you want? All in all a disappointing flight I always put Singapore Airlines in high regards but not this time. Such a pity - maybe the crew were just overworked. I would recommend if there was no alternative."
2019-08-27,9,9,"""A350 was really enjoyable""","✅ Trip Verified | Dusseldorf to Singapore. It was my first time on Singapore Airlines and I had pretty high hopes for the airline, and they were mostly fulfilled. The crew were very nice and clear about situations going on inflight. Considering I was flying economy, I would give them a good pass. Before boarding, the staff at the gate were pretty excited to welcome passengers. The seats were comfortable though my headrest was rather broken as its height was not adjustable. I enjoyed the seat pockets (you can organise your stuff pretty well) and everything felt good in quality. I also enjoyed the inflight entertainment. The screen was massive and clear and everything was responsive. The selection of movies was also really good with many rather recent movies. They provided an earphone adapter so you could use your own earphones easily when using the inflight entertainment. They distributed a menu before take-off. The food was quite good though my seat neighbours did not like it as much as I did. They provided drinks throughout the 12-hour flight. What I was surprised about, though, is that you can use your roaming data on the flight! In this case, you wouldn't need to purchase to the expensive onboard WiFi but instead, just subscribe for internet through your own data service provider. The A350 itself was also really enjoyable to fly with. Comfortable, spacious, large windows and rather quiet."
2019-08-25,9,9,"""the crew were meticulous""","✅ Trip Verified | Early morning flight to Jakarta, on the A350-900, with a 3-class configuration. The overall ambience of the cabin is bright and airy, and the newest version of the in-flight entertainment is a big bonus for this short hop flight. Seating is comfortable for this duration of flight (way better than the experience in an A320 or B737). We left on time, and the crew were then rushing to serve breakfast. Food was reasonably good (omelette or nasi lemak), and we landed on time also. Crew were a little rushed and courteous rather than friendly, but good enough. I appreciated that the crew were meticulous about asking passengers to raise their seats to the upright position for the meal service, small things like this help in economy."
2019-08-24,2,2,"""We travelled without meals""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Delhi. This was our return journey on SQ406 (SIN-DEL) after we arrived in singapore 10 days before with them on SQ401 (which was definitely very good) Things took a U-turn here. The crew onboard was RUDE to the core. No courtsey, Zero on management. We were assigned seats at the end of the plane for 5 people. At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have no food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals. 6 hours journey. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it. It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible. We could have done online checkin and booked our meals beforehand, but with the child, this is not possible to do so online and we had to do a manual checkin. Was this our fault? I don't think so."
2019-08-21,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Singapore, 16.5hrs overnight. 2 adults, 3 children (7yrs, 5yrs and 8 months old) at gate \i am told that the entertainment system does not work. 4 rows of seats are not working. in flight for 16.5hrs, no lights as windows required to be shut, no lights on the seats, not charger for phone, no entertainment, they offered me to move my 2 kids to the back of the airplane so they can watch movies, I guess they have no children. then offered me ~$110 USD voucher to use on the flight for the inconvenience. I had to play with my kids, draw and color using my phone flashlight, my wife feeding my 8mths old with her phone flashlight. This was Premium Economy seats that do not cost few dollars?? I complained and their response was, ""you received a voucher for the inconvenience and you rejected the two available seats."" I understand some issues are out of their control such as the system not operating but a $110 for the inconvenience, also, on the way back, our system works, but other passengers experience the same. Completely disappointed with Singapore Airlines Customer Relations. Will not travel with them again."
2019-08-19,7,7,"""there is nothing premium about the service""","✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service. Having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy, it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided."
2019-08-18,4,4,"""will return to AirAsia for future flights""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Canberra via Sydney. I have flown many times with economy airlines such as Jetstar and AirAsia. But my first ever flights with Singapore Airlines which I had high hopes for were a washout. The economy seats are much smaller than AirAsia and all you are getting for your extra dollars is a menu and entertainment options. Also I have an injury and asked for help getting on and off the plane before the crush. They made me get a medical certificate to prove the injury but let me on with every one else. And with a broken foot those small seats were even worse. I will return to AirAsia for future flights.
2019-08-08,8,8,"""definitely fly Singapore again""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Seat layout was 1-2-1, although no skybed for such a short flight. The seats were narrower but still comfortable. I fell asleep even before take-off and then woke up after to set my seat flat. Due to jetlag, I spent the entire flight asleep and the air stewardess asked if she could get me something else to eat when we were about to touch down. Great service. I will definitely fly Singapore again - although I am not sure if business class is worth the short trip."
2019-08-08,9,9,"""quality at its best""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines represents quality at its best - food, service, seats, entertainment. Champagne, juice or water upon boarding. With book the cook, I had chicken rice for lunch preceded by a satay appetizer and succeeded by cheese platter for dessert. The skybed folds out for a comfortable sleep. Service was very quick each time I pressed the call bell. Seat layout is 1-2-1. I still think Singapore Airlines business class is by far the best in the world due to wider seats that are more comfortable."
2019-08-05,2,2,"""flight is perpetually delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Surabaya. I always fly Singapore airlines for work, and it has been getting worse by the day. The flight is perpetually delayed. It seems like they do not have a good concept of punctuality. In addition, cabin crew are average in terms of service and pleasantness. the hard product in itself is not something to be lauded. However, among all of it, it has always been the late departure over and over is the one that I think is the biggest pain."
2019-08-03,8,8,"""crew seemed to be quite inattentive""","Not Verified | Singapore to Beijing in economy class and the A380 I took was only a 75% retrofitted plane (Econ Class left out). The seats, toilets, catering was ok but the crew seemed to be quite inattentive and the economy class on that A380 was old and shabby. Other than that, food seems to be great but my flight had a 30min delay due to a drone flying around at Changi Airport 2nd runway so there was a single runway operation. Other than that it was great so thanks Singapore Airlines."
2019-07-30,2,2,"""not even close to Qatar Airways""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Singapore. BKK to SIN on a newish B789 with a great new Business Class seat; comfortable and great IFE with a large HD touchscreen screen. Lounge in Singapore a rather mediocre experience, overcrowded with average food offerings. SQ lounge in BKK was much better. The big disappointment of this trip was the ancient B772 on the SG to IST sector. It was the very old business class seat which is very very uncomfortable. IFE was poor due to the small non touch screen. As usual, no amenity kit, the fresh flowers in the washrooms have been replaced by tacky plastic flowers. It is very hard to understand why the airlines provides a really good hardware product on a 2h flight, but is not able to do the same on a 11h overnight flight. Service and food on both flights was just average. SQ does not even come close to the business class product of Qatar Airways which I usually fly long haul."
2019-07-29,9,9,"""Overall great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Beijing via Singapore. Overall great experience and Singapore definitely have satisfied us. Upon boarding a hot towel was served. The seat was quite soft, reasonably wide and the legroom was above average. Two full meals were provided on the Melbourne to Singapore sector which was some of the highest quality airline food I have experienced in Economy Class, complemented by the usage of metal cutlery and the ice cream dessert. The only drawback from the flight would be the rather inconvenient Wi-Fi service with pretty much unacceptable pricing for the average user, although on-board SMS and calls were provided, given your carrier supports it on their side. Overall a great experience and does seem to be worth paying a little bit extra for."
2019-07-28,7,7,"""usual high standard of SIA is there""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bangkok return. In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN. Overall, SIA still manage to being one of the top airlines in the world despite some cost cutting. Take advantage of their promotions, which can sometimes beat the budget airlines by the hands down."
2019-07-28,7,7,"""processes of serving special meals""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Delhi via Singapore. Amazing airline. Excellent customer service. Good food. But cannot understand how this, one of the best airline in the world, has ignored the plight of thousands of travellers who order special meal for so long. The problem is neither with the food nor the service standard of the crew. It is to do with the processes of serving the special meals. Special meals are first served. But no drinks are offered or served on demand. Either one should wait until the remaining passengers are served food with drinks and get a drink and let the nice food sit on the tray and let it get cold. Or eat the food without any drinks, not even water. Singapore Airline should change its processes so thst the crew should bring the same trolley containing the selection of drinks while serving the special meal and offer the same selection of drinks to passengers being served special meal."
2019-07-25,2,2,"""absolutely appalled by the service""","Not Verified | Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore’s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn’t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It’s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers. My wife and I are absolutely appalled by the service we received from Singapore Airlines. We have made this same journey to Europe 7 times as leisure travellers in the last 8 years and this was by far the worst experience."
2019-07-19,5,5,"""most uncomfortable seats""","✅ Trip Verified | For about 40 years my wife have used business class (including Singapore Airlines many times) for international travel;. On 6 July 2019 we flew Business Class, Brisbane to Singapore on SQ 246. For this Flight, Cabin Crew were excellent, food was very good, cabin was very clean. Seats were very wide. However, for sleeping they were the most uncomfortable seats we have ever encountered. They were hard, you had to lie at an angle and fit your feet into a very small cavity. They were sufficiently uncomfortable that we would never choose Singapore Airlines again for an overnight flight."
2019-07-18,10,10,"""Simply the best!""","✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Singapore. Simply the best! Singapore Airlines really delivers a best-in-class experience – seat, food, and entertainment were all fantastic. But where SQ really stands out is service; I've never seen cabin staff put in such dedication and professionalism: they remembered passenger preferences and native language throughout the 12 hour journey, were always there if you needed anything, and even personally showed passengers to their seats in economy & helped to get bags into the bins. Premium Economy really delivers a competitive product: notably more space and comfort than Economy without the expense or extra frills of Business (I'm 6'0"" and couldn't touch the bulkhead with my feet even when I stretched out and tried). Most comfortable Premium Economy seat I've tried."
2019-07-15,10,10,"""amazing cabin crew service""","✅ Trip Verified | Jogjakarta to Amsterdam via Singapore. Good aircraft and amazing cabin crew service. I got a special assistant because I flew myself carrying 1 baby aged 6 months and 1 child aged 4 years. it was amazing for me to feel service in the air that I had never received before. While I was carrying a baby, there was a cabin crew coming to calm down my daughter with earplugs. Then came the cabin crew carrying candy and feeding my child. then came the cabin crew again carrying cookies and finally there was another cabin crew carrying some pillows and putting them on my child's back. Thanks for that amazing service."
2019-07-14,7,7,"""Food was quite good""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. Originally booked onto a later flight which was to be operated by a B777, but was offered an earlier option when I checked in rather early. So ended up flying on this B787, which didn't have a first class but only business and economy. Food was quite good - Choice of prawn noodles or omelette with beef sausage (Chose the latter). IFE was decent but have seen better ones at other airlines. Cabin was not cool enough and felt a bit stuffy."
2019-07-13,8,8,"""overall impression was pretty good""","✅ Trip Verified | Zurich to Singapore. Overall a good flight. Our overall impression was pretty good. The crew was polite but seemed disorganized. The quality of the food was reasonable. We ordered via book the cook but the main meal was served lukewarm and the meat was very dry and hard. My husband was offered a dessert, I had to ask for it. The seat was ok,but quite hard in my opinion. The control of the seats did not always respond."
2019-07-11,7,7,"""A380 looks a little shabby""",✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Singapore. The cabin of SIA A380 looks a little shabby & old especially the cushion cover. May needs some refurbishment if the aircraft will still be service for another decade.
2019-07-09,1,1,"""the worst most arrogant crew""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew Johannesburg to Singapore on SQ479 on July 7th in Business Class and experienced the worst most arrogant crew ever. I travelled with my wife and 2 Daughters (2 and 4 years old) and we were assigned seats 19F and 20D and F. As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row? Maybe SQ needs to inform pilots who is paying their high salary."
2019-07-04,9,9,"""One of the best inflight services""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Singapore. One of the best inflight services I have experienced. The inflight staff was the highlight of the entire experience. Warm, courteous and always ready with a smile. Just lovely people helping and serving all around."
2019-07-04,7,7,"""The seat was in a word, horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore . I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine. The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice. If they can improve their seat and value their star gold more, I would be a returning customer."
2019-07-04,3,3,"""What a disappointing flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Zurich. What a disappointing flight. Probably the worst crew I ever had, very inattentive. It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me. There are much better Premium Economy products out there."
2019-06-30,6,6,"""standards seem to be declining""","❎ Not Verified | Singapore to Tokyo. The airline seems to have gone on a cost-cutting mode. On a seven-hour flight, only one meal served. For a premium full-service airline to do these things in disappointing. Competition on this route provides better catering options. The seat was average economy class seat. The crew was polite and professional. Overall, SQ standards seem to be declining."
2019-06-30,10,10,"""big thank you for everyone""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Sydney. I foolishly left my video gaming device on the seat next to mine and only found out after I reached my hotel. I panicked and called up the ground handler for Singapore Airlines and never got through via the phone number provided on the website even after 22 times. However I called up the Singapore Airlines Krisflyer hotline and the sweetest lady reassured me and told me they would log a request to check the aircraft for the item, her kind tone and understanding nature really helped soothe my nerves and gave me some peace of mind. Half way through my trip I got the news that my item was found and I could collect it before leaving Sydney. As much as I will strive to be less careless, I am so glad that I could count on the customer-oriented culture and all-round excellence and efficiency that the SQ team has displayed in the times where I slip up. A big thank you for everyone from the customer service team to the ground handler for reuniting me with my lost item!"
2019-06-29,10,10,"""very pleasant and enjoyable""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Hong Kong. Flight attendants were really helpful throughout the whole flight. Although it was a full flight, the flight attendants paid a lot of attention to detail to serve the passengers. One of the flight attendants helped find ways to keep a hand carry item for a passenger somewhere as the flight was packed and had no available space for her item. They kept her updated on how the item was as the item was ""fragile"". My mom told me that she felt that SIA kept their standards as the last time she flown with SIA was 16 years ago. Overall, I had a very pleasant and enjoyable flight."
2019-06-26,1,1,"""located within 50cm of toilets""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Rome via Singapore. First time travelling business my seat was literally located within 50cm of the toilets at the rear of business class. During this long flight these toilets were continually in use not only by business class but also economy class, and i was kept awake. I believe that these seats should not be offered as business class given there location. I would have rather spent the flight in economy class rather then being next to the toilets"
2019-06-26,10,10,"""Fantastic service""","Not Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. Fantastic service. Food was delicious I had Indian vegetarian meal and great improvement to last time. The old A380’s are the best, so comfortable, the new ones have uncomfortable cramped seats that I cannot sleep on not as wide as the old ones. Also not sure what the problem is with the cabin air but every time I’m in the new planes there’s a smell from the toilets. Arrived feeling as though I hadn’t flown some 10000 miles."
2019-06-23,1,1,"""poor value for money""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Manila. Old plane with dirty interior. The cushion was depressed so you are left sitting on a hard bench. Entertainment system rarely works and the crew don't care about anything. On these poorer routes, they use these older planes which means often they break down leaving you stranded. Really poor value for money and definitely not the quality airline of the past."
2019-06-21,1,1,"""I am utterly disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I was on flight SQ 317 from London Heathrow Airport to Singapore Changi Airport on 13th June 2019. As a Singaporean, I am utterly disappointed and disgraced by the service standards of the SQ Crew. After take off, the first meal was served. The stewardess briskly shoved us our meal trays and asked if I want any beverages with my meal. I replied with my choice of beverage (coffee). She simply walked away after acknowledging my request without saying anything at all. I thought maybe she didn't have coffee on her tray so she went to get some. But she never returned. I was appalled by this. Next was snack time. A different stewardess came with the snack tray ask if we would like any snacks. As my sister was hungry and we saw on the menu that sandwiches and wraps was available in the snack menu, I requested for a sandwich/wrap. The stewardess reply was a brusque ""I don't have any, I'll check"" and she too walked away without coming back. What ever happened to our friendly SQ crew? I was shocked by their attitude and more shocked that it seems SQ crew have short term memory loss. Twice they did not come back to me and left me hanging."
2019-06-18,8,8,"""Highly recommend Singapore""","Not Verified | Highly recommend Singapore. The crew is the biggest asset to this airline, they are not only highly professional they are also friendly and personable. The crew on our flight went out of their way to help us when our son got a blood nose upon landing, ensuring his wellbeing and helping us even after all passengers had disembarked. The customer service is outstanding, we wouldn’t fly with any other airline."
2019-06-18,3,3,"""she was refused entry""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Melbourne via Singapore. Average at best. Check in and baggage drop off hassle free. Lounge doesn’t have a great selection of food. As a gold velocity member with a third family member travelling on a different Star Alliance flight, she was refused entry despite gold membership allowing a guest, and travelling business class. I was met with 3 staff members who stuck to their guns. The lounge was quiet, but they assured me it would fill. I will never use this airline again."
2019-06-15,9,9,"\""Would definitely recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Auckland via Singapore. Great experience with SIA. Better food than I thought it was going to be and a brilliant and friendly cabin crew. Choose to fly with them all the time and we are never disappointed. Very comfortable for economy class. Great entertainment system with all the latest movies, etc. Would definitely recommend."
2019-06-12,7,7,"""Cabin service was exceptional as usual""","✅ Trip Verified | The Melbourne to Wellington flight is an early morning flight, arriving in Wellington in the afternoon just in time for most hotel check-ins. The short-haul international flight serves one round of meals with 4 options for mains available. I went for the cheese omelette and it was great. Cabin service was exceptional as usual. However, the aircraft itself is very dated, especially the seats. The seats are in a 2-2-2 configuration, and it's not the best Singapore Airlines Business Class seats. It's okay for the short-haul flight, as they turn into flat-angled beds. There's lots of leg space and decent width. In-flight entertainment technology was dated, but the content is good in terms of library and variety. All in all, it's definitely the best Melbourne-Wellington offering (when compared to narrow-bodied aircrafts of Qantas, Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand), but it's not the best SQ offering."
2019-06-06,10,10,"""service and food was great""","✅ Trip Verified | Brisbane to Amsterdam via Singapore. I used almost all airline companies operating between Australia and Europe and in my opinion Singapore Airlines is the best. Flight was great, service and food was great. Very professional staff. I will fly with Singapore Airlines anytime, and recommend."
2019-06-03,8,8,"""good for economy class""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Amsterdam. I am not sure I can rave about the service on this flight relative to the other Singapore Airlines flights I have taken. The stewardess just got on the side step of my seat to shut the overhead lockers without warning. Yes - I may be in economy, but just let me know. Seat is average - because no one was next to me, I found the flight fairly comfortable and was able to get a few hours of sleep. Food was also quite good but again, the stewardess forgot to give me a bread roll but only the butter and I had to remind them. Despite the small hiccups with service, the flight is good for economy class standards. I will fly Singapore Airlines again."
2019-06-03,5,5,"""Such a disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | Such a disappointment Christchurch to Singapore seats 33H and 33K, and SIN-CHC 32D and 32E in premium economy. We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 — just one seat less than economy — compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didn't work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIA’s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isn’t worth the extra cost. It doesn’t feel special at all. We’d probably look at Air NZ or another airline next time."
2019-06-03,10,10,"""economy class is good value""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. This is an older airbus and seats are ok, with decent leg space. Very happy with the shopping selection for Jun to Aug - the Sulwhasoo selection onboard has expanded again! Food is decent and is served with real cutlery (as opposed to cheap plastic cutlery and cardboard containers on other economy class flights). Service is great. For a 5 hour flight, Singapore Airlines economy class is good value."
2019-06-01,4,4,"""All in all poor value""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. First flight with Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy and what a disappointment. It had little to differentiate it other than a little more space. I ordered via book the cook which was a nice feature although my meal was delivered first and in asking for a drink, I was told to wait a while. I asked how long that would be and was told 2 mins and then it was suggested I drink the plastic cup of water given. Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn't make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit. The seat was not comfortable and the IFE was so poor I watched content from my PC. FA's were polite but not really interested. The 380 interiors felt old and indeed first impressions were of a budget airline. All in all poor value."
2019-05-31,6,6,"""Crew are a mixed bag""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bangkok. Food standards have dropped drastically. Crew are a mixed bag - some attendants were friendly and helpful like the purser and supervisor and one attendant who went out of her way and offered to move me from my seat next to a crying baby and family to an empty cluster of 3 seats, 10 rows back before takeoff which was very kind of her. However, some attendants are grumpy and have zero manners. The seat feels exactly the same as a 10 in a row 777-300 on Cathay. Fairly acceptable for someone my height at 5’2 but could be uncomfortable for anyone bigger and on a longer flight. Food was terrible - fish was overcooked and the dessert was rubbery. Should have brought my own dinner instead. Only consolation was the Singapore sling and Bailey's I consumed that was not diluted with ice cubes. Hot towel before takeoff is a rarity in economy for any other airlines. In flight entertainment is excellent as always with lots of music and movies which distracted me from the lousy food. However, for the price I paid, I’d rather go with Thai Airways which has way better food and more consistent service. Check in staff were rude and asked me to pay 200$ to take the earlier flight to Singapore when I arrived at the check-in desk 3 hours beforehand with a 4-hour layover coming from a domestic flight."
2019-05-30,1,1,"""was the worst flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Singapore. This flight without exception, was the worst flight I've ever been on. The cabin crew seemed to be going through the platitudes of service but forgetting to actually deliver. In my case, I asked for a bottle of water instead of breakfast. Stewardess disappeared, meals were served, and expecting that someone would drop off the water after meal service, I declined the little cup that was offered to me during the meal service. That was a mistake and I just gave up so 3 hours later, I couldn't wait to get off the flight to get a bottle of water. I'm a fairly low maintenance passenger, so I'm not someone that will keep badgering the cabin crew for service. But to me this was just such a basic. Like how difficult is it to drop off a bottle of water to someone! I have a return flight booked with Singapore and to be honest Id have switched Jetstar but the flight time to work. Next time I won't pay double the price for a flight with Singapore expecting service. I might as well just use Jetstar!"
2019-05-29,10,10,"""whole staff was great""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to San Francisco. I experienced horrible chest pains during the flight & Mr Arfat was very attentive to helping me get back to normal. The whole staff was great!
2019-05-27,10,10,"""a five star experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Auckland to Zurich via Singapore return and we flew with our 19 month old boy and it’s was his first flight. We were quite picky of choosing right airline and it’s a very long journey for little boy, I like to say Singapore Airlines is the best, very friendly staff and child friendly, alway willing to go extra miles to help their passengers. It’s a five star experience, we will fly with you anytime, and recommend to everyone"
2019-05-26,5,5,"""standard has dropped drastically""","✅ Trip Verified | Osaka to Singapore. There is no hot drink served When we received our meal, we asked for hot drink but they told us it will come later. It never came. We have not finished the meal, but they have already started serving ice cream. I couldn’t finish my meal in time and my tea never came at all. It seems like everything is in a rush. My cold drink not finished yet and the whole tray was collected. The standard has dropped drastically over the years. I choose SQ because I am Singaporean. There are other airline much better than SQ."
2019-05-26,3,3,"""best feature was the legroom""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Male. They used to be good. Air hostesses were rude and unhelpful. The food was shocking, no consideration for people with allergies or special dietary requirements. The in flight entertainment was disappointing. Hardly any tv shows only one or two major movies available on a 8 hour flight. Wouldn’t recommend Singapore airlines and wouldn’t waste my time going to their lounge. Probably the best feature was the legroom in the seats."
2019-05-22,6,6,"""Not good enough""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London Heathrow with Singapore Airlines. We ordered gluten free meals which were good. However in a 13.5 hour flight other than fruit that was all we were given until I complained. There are 9 hours between the two main meals. Fruit is not enough. We are both hypoglycaemic and need some form of carbohydrates. There was nothing. We were told we need to bring our own snacks. Everyone else had the option of sandwiches and muffins. None of which was available gluten free. Not good enough!
2019-05-20,7,7,"""not at the level they used to be""","Not Verified | I fly to Sydney periodically and given previous experience, my preferred airline is Singapore Airlines - previous experiences have always been excellent. This time, unfortunately, I found the service levels to have dropped - young stewards and stewardesses dashing past repeatedly in a darkened aisle brushing people and waking them up, followed by a minor glance backwards but no apology. Apart from that, I sensed a general decline in standards - not as many smiles and rushing, the work seems more like a chore than the past when there was a sense of ""its our pleasure to help you"". Still better than many airlines but not at the level they used to be. I would add that the food (I keep a kosher diet) they served from Sydney (Lewis Continental Kitchen) was poor."
2019-05-14,7,7,"""reputation from the past""","✅ Trip Verified | First time we had ever flown SQ business class so were looking forward to it as the reviews seem largely positive. Upon checking in, we went to the lounge, very underwhelmed ; for an airline that has 4 flights per day, the food selection at 5pm was very limited and not even champagne offered. Upon boarding the aircraft seemed very tired and dated. The menu was ok because we had pre ordered Book the Cook. But if we had not we would have been very disappointed as the menu selection was very average, more like economy offerings. The seat was the widest seat I have ever been in so no complaints here. However the inflight entertainment left a lot to be desired, very old technology and not easy to use. The mattress provided was not even fitting the bed which was not lie flat and no amenity kits provided. But the service from the crew was outstanding. I feel that SQ is trading on its premium reputation from the past but needs to improve quite a bit to compete with the likes of the Middle Eastern carriers who have a much better all round product. Would not fly them again in a hurry."
2019-05-13,1,1,"""Horrible first time experience""",✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Horrible first time experience. So they oversell the flight and bump me down to premium economy. Never again. They offered to rebook me the next day which does not work on a business trip. How would you expect a first time customer to react.
2019-05-09,2,2,"""the worst seats ever""","Not Verified | New York to Singapore. We purchased the extra legroom seats for $120 per person/per flight. They are the worst seats ever. Yes, you get lots of legroom but you lose window, there are no windows at these seats, which is not told when you go onto the site to book, sleep, the lights never fully go out because you are right by the bathroom, plus you have the bathroom light shining in your face because no one ever closes the door, and you have to listen to the nonstop clicking of the bathroom door, your legroom, because people use your space to stand and stretch their legs and this is not monitored by the flight attendants. You are in the section with the crying babies, there is an actual section for babies. There is no storage space so you have to put all of your stuff in the overhead bin, and you have to stow your tv during takeoff and landing so there is a good hour of just sitting there while everyone else is watching tv. I can’t believe we paid $500 for these terrible seats. If I had known I would have kept the cattle seats and stretched my legs on my way to the bathroom. Personally I think you should get a discount for sitting in these seats."
2019-05-06,10,10,"""recommend Singapore Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines lived up to its incredible reputation. The flight attendants, especially the purser, were fun to interact with throughout the flight. The beef rendang choice I had was delicious and the wine and champagne served was truly in-flight dining at its best. The in-flight entertainment had quite a selection of current movies, so we had plenty of options to keep ourselves entertained. We were staying overnight at the Aerotel and the purser gave us some water and slippers for us to have on our journey. Although the cabin was pretty full, the cabin crew made us feel like we were on our own private jet. I'd highly recommend Singapore Airlines, based on this experience."
2019-05-05,8,8,"""Seats are comfortable""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Seats are comfortable for economy class. Slight recline. Decent menu - Asian or Western selection. Design of the plane is strange. The entire plane uses a small group of toilets right in the middle of the plane - never heard that many flushes in 5 hours. Good service. Will fly again in a different seat.
2019-05-02,7,7,"""Very good service""",✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Singapore. Very good service and decent food for economy class. Air stewardesses were patient and provided great service even though I had a request nearly every hour for the first half of the 13 hour flight. I paid for an extra legroom seat and was disappointed to find that the charging points were located below the seat next to me. This is the seat that is 2nd from the exit row and next to the window. Better to sit right at the front.
2019-05-01,1,1,"""I would not recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical 'red eye' flight, and I'm at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a 'we don't care' kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft. I will be returning to Cebu to see my daughter at least two more times this year, but I will definitely not be flying SIA. I will revoke my KrisFlyer membership as well. I have flown budget airlines that are better than this. Buyer, beware! I would not recommend."
2019-04-30,8,8,"""Everything was as expected""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Melbourne. Everything was as expected in terms of priority check in, priority baggage and seating, service food, etc. Staff seemed a bit jaded and the flight was 30 minutes late leaving and arriving."
2019-04-25,1,1,"""Seat was very uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Booked a business class flight from Singapore to Manila on a Boeing 787 expecting a lie-flat seat. Upon boarding, we were informed that there was an aircraft change to a very old A330 plane without lie-flat seats. Seat was very uncomfortable, not worth a business class ticket. Plane was probably a decade old or more. Inflight entertainment is likewise outdated, not even a touchscreen. Lobster thermidor was salty, rice and asparagus were overcooked. Do not book Singapore Airlines business class, not worth it."
2019-04-22,5,5,"""really felt disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class. Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip - no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea. We arrived in Shanghai wondering was that Singapore Airlines we heard so much about? We really felt disappointment. Nothing really bad, just a very very ordinary trip."

Had paid double our tour group and opted for Singapore over a low cost Asian airlines. Totally regretted it - staff so rude to the children. Food awful. No drinks offered except one with meal. Total waste of thousands of dollars, our group had an outstanding experience with the low cost carrier."

I was very dissapointed with the way things were handled on 3 March 2019 before the flight, I was unable to board my flight, I let Singapore Airlines know via email, also tried calling but was unable to get through. I had to wait until Monday for anyone to help me and then got charged for a new flight ($584) due to missing the flight the day prior, even though I had notified the airline 6 hours before flight that I was going to miss it due to my Visa approval not arriving on time. Having paid this amount along with penalties for missing my previous flight has left me in a difficult financial situation so I'm not impressed."

I have flown a couple of times with Singapore Airlines in the last two years and every time it is been a perfect experience due the staff and service offered on the plane. I have not me such dedicated and hard-working attendants on any other airline than in Singapore Airlines, as well as the quality of the food offered on their business class flights. The same great experience, as always, was on my last flight. I was also very happy with the service at check-in that is perfectly smooth and efficient."
2019-04-07,9,9,"""I would recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Hong Kong. Singapore Airlines is usually my family's airline choice because of the great service, seats and special assistance (I travel with a wheelchair with a Yamaha motor and battery). Checking in going to Hong Kong and leaving took a while due to the staff being unfamiliar with the chair. The check in staff going did not not pass information to the gate agent was asked the same questions again. When we landed in Hong Kong, the wheelchair had a bit of damage but was settled by the ground staff. Upon return, we were told to wait somewhere for the wheelchair but it turned out to be at baggage reclaim. Both flights were very good despite the issues on the ground which I wouldn't blame Singapore airlines for. The cabin pressure on the A350 was minimal compared to other aircraft. If you need special assistance traveling I would recommend flying on Singapore airlines."
2019-04-06,5,5,"""aircraft that was so cold""",Not Verified | My wife and I flew Heathrow to Singapore return we have never flown in an aircraft that was so cold even with our coats on and using the blankets provided it was freezing. Also the food provided was amongst the worst had on a aircraft. It’s a shame because the seats were fine and the aircrew fantastic. Also no delays at checkout and Singapore airport must be on of the best around.
2019-04-05,1,1,"""disappointed and annoyed""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I’m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said “sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her” she said “you can’t use these toilets you have to go back” I explained the queue situation but she wouldn’t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it’s the only pram we have and we couldn’t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience."
2019-04-05,10,10,"""Seat was comfortable""",✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Dubai via Singapore. This flight was better compared to my DXB-MNL experience. Crew were genuinely friendly. Greeting and talking to you with smile. They offered beverage options several times. Food was ok though. I was still looking forward to their IFE. Great option to save a playlist. Seat was comfortable. Not a fan of their 3-3-3 seat configuration but I was able to select a window seat at the last row of the mid section with only 2 seats. Big plus factor to the overall experience is the Singapore Changi Airport.

We are two seasoned travellers, both very accustomed to long-haul routes. The A350 is a superb bird! It has to be said that the service provided in all four of the legs with Singapore Airlines was exceptional, from beginning to end (both on the ground and airborne); all staff where extremely professional, yet fun, friendly and accommodating to all passenger's needs. This cabin crew in particular who looked after us on the long, SQ37 flight from LAX to SIN on 14/03/2019, provided beyond exceptional service. They were actively and consistently attending passenger's requests, as well as checking that we were happy and well looked after, for what appeared to be the whole duration of the flight, or about 17+ hours. It was so satisfying and reassuring to see the dedication that this particular team had for their duties, as well as a clear love of the job. Great ambassadors for such well regarded airline such as SQ. We just simply couldn't had hoped for a more enjoyable journey. It is now clear to us that Singapore Airlines deserves to be the world's best airline. We are truly looking forward to our next Singapore Airlines journey, which we hope will take place in the near future - this new experience in air travel has opened a new and fascinating window in our holidays."

Excellent cabin staff and amazing inflight entertainment options. Food however was a major disappointment. Ordered the fish with dill sauce and apart from the the mashed potato, it was flavourless. The ""pizza"" snack served before landing was terrible stodgy. Wine options were either a very poor white or an even rougher red. I can't understand how Singapore can get everything else so right and the food so wrong."
2019-03-19,5,5,"""not very well designed""","Not Verified | Singapore to London Heathrow. For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider. I cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the A 380-800 again."

Steward was very impatient to the passenger in front of me when asked about the status. Disappointed that my feedback in the last few flights on the same journey wasn't considered at all. 03 Mar 2019 - SQ5254 Preferred meal was forgotten. I had listed a preferred meal in my preference. 10 Mar 2019 - SQ957 Lead steward conveniently forgot about my request. In the end I did not get any meals on board.

Singapore Airlines 'Book The Cook' service in business class is excellent and I wish all airlines offered pre-booking for main meals. My Lobster Thermidor was delicious, the cheese board was well presented and the apricot and pumpkin puree with the scallops was divine. Their cabin crew are welcoming and friendly, well trained, attentive and very efficient. All with a quiet charm as they glide through the cabin.

During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didn't do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight, the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal, and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency? Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away."
2019-03-11,8,8,"""my experience was mixed""","✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Manila via Singapore. First time to fly with SQ. I have very high expectations based on reviews and awards. However, my experience was mixed. Food and IFE were great and amazing. Cabin crew always smiling although it sometimes felt mechanical. Simple kit was also provided. DXB-SIN, B777-300ER was great however SIN-MNL aircraft was old didnt even bother using the IFE. Food served was not clearly advised that one option was spicy. I liked the food however overheard another passenger who doesn't like spicy food said that she wished she was told that it was spicy. Had some interesting encounters with cabin crew. First, a cabin crew used his index finger to give instructions to me instead of open palm/hand. Another cabin crew, during beverage serving, gave me the remaining orange juice as if i have no choice to make. Although both were minor hiccups. One funny incident had me cheering silently for the cabin crew as one of the adult passenger (father of another young adult passenger) kept on answering from the opposite row on behalf of his son every time a cabin crew would ask his son thus making a bit of a minor noise/disturbance. Cabin crew reminded the adult passenger that his son is old enough to answer simple questions. Fierce, i liked it. That's why im raising my overall experience score to 8 because of that."
2019-03-10,2,2,"""not rate my journey a pleasant one""","✅ Trip Verified | This was my 5th experience with Singapore Airlines but very different than the other 4. We had our Mumbai to Singapore flight delayed by 5-6 hours and eventually the 2nd flight from Singapore to Melbourne too got delayed however by 8-9 hours. We were made to stay in Ramada Singapore where the lunch was not made available to us, dinner too was compromised. We had a terrible stay and food in the hotel. Overall, I would not rate my journey a pleasant one."
2019-03-04,10,10,"""by far the best""","Not Verified | This was the first time my wife and I flew Singapore Airlines, what a wonderful experience! From check-in to deplaning everything went smoothly and on time. The cabin crew were superb. The service was attentive, food delicious, the cabin was attractive and very clean, including bathrooms. We flew United from Singapore to San Francisco, after our Singapore vacation, and the flight was no way near as good. Singapore Airlines will start flying direct from Seattle to Singapore non-stop in September 2019 and we definitely will use them when we visit Singapore again. P.S. We flew United on frequent flyer miles to India, and from Singapore to Seattle via San Francisco, Singapore Airlines is by far the best."
2019-03-03,8,8,"""seats are comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Older plane and business class seats are 2x2x2, so no wifi on board. However seats are comfortable and have a good recline, which is not bad for the short flight from Singapore to Perth. Meals are fantastic, especially as we booked the cook - the assam fish was one of the best I have ever had. Entertainment selection is decent and inflight shopping selection is wide. Best of all, service is impeccable."
2019-03-03,10,10,"""a fantastic airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Singapore. Singapore Airlines has the best service. Wide selection of inflight shopping. Food is fantastic. We had satay before our appetizer and it was as close as you can get in a satay stall without charcoal. A good range of new movies with the new month. The best thing about AMS to SG is the skybed, which gave us some decent sleep ahead of arriving in SG. Unfortunately, there was limited stock of sake. I had one and there was none left!! Wifi was good when available - the 30MB gets chewed up very quickly! Nevertheless, this is a fantastic airline and we will definitely fly again as our airline of choice."
2019-03-03,8,8,"""plane now seems a bit tired""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to London Heathrow. The cabin crew on this flight worked tirelessly to keep the passengers comfortable. They were smart, professional and extremely personable. I'd have liked it to have been warmer on board, still feeling cold even with a down jacket on. The plane now seems a bit tired with a couple of screens not working and a head rest which wouldn't stay up. I too would like to see considerably less plastic used."
2019-03-02,5,5,"""plastic wasted horrifying""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Hanoi. Although the service was great, I found the amount of plastic wasted horrifying. Everything was wrapped in plastic. There was even a plastic cup to put your water that was contained in a plastic cup. Wouldn't fly with Singapore again."
2019-02-28,9,9,"""couldn't fault the service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines has impressed me on the Singapore-Sydney route for the first time. It is evident that the morning flights are much better than the night time flights. As SQ 211 departed, a great lunch was served followed by multiple drink rounds before a mini pizza prior to landing, which compares well against the red eye SQ221 and 231. The staff were quite courteous with the exception of one cabin crew member, the rest were extremely pleasant. Specially the leading crew in charge was particularly friendly. Flight landed ahead of schedule and all in all, I couldn't fault the service."
2019-02-28,9,9,"""a very high standard throughout""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Easy boarding with punctual push back and arrival. Latest seats – I loved the wrap-round screen for the seat, almost like some other airlines first class. The steward had to put my bed down for me and I found it rather hard for sleeping on. IFE was not really 5* standard. Food and service were excellent throughout. Overall, a very high standard throughout."
2019-02-27,3,3,"""you lost a loyal flyer""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up.  While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?   Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though. Sorry Singapore airlines, you lost a loyal flyer who has flow the long route for more than 20 years.."
2019-02-27,10,10,"""a pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Tokyo. The flight was fully packed, but we still manage to fly on time and reach there slightly earlier than scheduled. I flew with friends and took a row of seat. We accidentally spilled a drink, and the stewardess was smiling as they help us clean the mess, they also keep coming back to us to check if our seats are dry, giving us extra napkins and later, extra blankets telling us to sit on it. What a pleasant experience. In flight entertainment was great, plenty of choices, and movies from all over the world. One thing though, we found the leg space to be slightly smaller than usual, not sure if it was all the winter clothing we had with us, or the seat space shrunk. We chose different meals, and tried each others', they taste great."
2019-02-26,3,3,"""performed poor sloppy service""",✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Dusseldorf via Singapore. During meal service SQ flight BKK- SIN and SIN-DUS I requested hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant did not pay attention then gave me a salad sauce instead of coke and tea lemon. I was hocked and repeated my request for hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant politely smiled and skipped my request. Dinner meal was without any dessert on international flight SIN-DUS. I was surprised there is no dessert. I asked crew and they said no dessert and no fruits. During snack service they offered only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. There is poor meal quality on international flights and Singapore Airlines crew members were not attentive just poor attention and performed poor sloppy service. Poor WIFI connection. Awful! Bad experience.
2019-02-26,1,1,"""had to sit rows apart""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Singapore. We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines in economy class from LAX for 11/2018. A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided. They said “no”, terms and conditions protect them. Beware of Singapore Airlines offers as they may not be what you expect, especially for an airline that touts their reputation. We were extremely disappointed in their offer, service, and response! First and last time we will fly with them."
2019-02-25,9,9,"""seats very well-designed""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines on their Boeing 787-10 from Singapore to Nagoya. Check-in was efficient, and at boarding the crew was very warm and friendly, greeting everyone with a smile. The aircraft was very comfortable, the seats were very well-designed and the cabin also felt very comfortable. IFE was SQ's newest product and I had no problems using it, it was very responsive and being a touchscreen, was also very convenient. The aircraft left on time and we were in the air very quickly. Cabin service was conducted very efficiently, and the crew was also very warm and sincere, typical of SQ's high standards, After the first cabin service(mostly drinks), the lights were dimmed so that the passengers could sleep(it was a red-eye flight) and the crew was very attentive to the passengers' requests, walking up and down the aisle every now and then to ensure we were comfortable. Around 2 hours before landing, breakfast was served - the only negative thing about this flight, as the food was not really good in my opinion. On landing, the crew bade goodbye to each passenger, smiling as they always did throughout the flight, Overall, it was an excellent flight, and I would definitely fly them again"
2019-02-25,10,10,""" one of the best out there""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines on my trip back from Japan on their A350-900, and the experience was really positive. In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers. Overall, I would recommend SQ, although the prices might sometimes be a little higher, it is worth as you are paying for what you get, and SQ is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service, matching ANA, who are known for their exceptional cabin service."
2019-02-25,8,8,"""a good economy experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Denpasar Bali. Early morning departure from SIN at Chinese New Year, so it was a pretty full flight. Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear. So a good economy experience and I guess the additional cost for the flight (as opposed to the budget airline) pays off when something does wrong, as the recovery was really fast."
2019-02-25,9,9,"""a very comfortable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Service is unparalleled. Food is very good and served on proper plates with real cutlery. Wide selection of online shopping. Best thing about this flight was the sky bed. The chair unfolds into a flat bed, which gave my son and I some decent sleep. The plane leaves SG just before midnight and arrives in AMS around 6.15am - so even a 12 hour flight seems like no time is wasted. Wifi is available on board but requires payment. The complimentary allowance for business class members is only suited for text messages - runs out fast. Overall, a very comfortable flight. Will definitely fly again."
2019-02-23,9,9,"""food was satisfying""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to New York. The entertainment center/movies were superb, although some of the plug connections were older, so the voice is low. One time, the flight was making a loud bothering noise, and we were concerned about it especially during take off. The next flight was delayed, they decided to replace the airplane. I appreciate it that they put safety before anything else. The food was satisfying. The attendants smile. They worked fast in getting what the customers need. They are always ready to answer calls."
2019-02-22,9,9,"""my seat could not lie flat""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. Outstanding service. In flight shopping has a huge selection of quality products. Book the cook menu was impressive - lobster thermidor and my son's steak were cooked to perfection. The selection of beverages was fantastic. Entertainment selection is not bad. This is an older plane, so unfortunately my seat could not lie flat and my son's screen was slightly damaged. Nevertheless, seats are still comfortable for the short flight from Perth to Singapore."
2019-02-17,9,9,"""great cabin crew and great food""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Milan with Singapore Airlines. A generally excellent airline with great cabin crew and great food. The seat was very comfortable for my 12hr and 30min flight and it really changed the way I feel of flying!
2019-02-14,10,10,"""were very impressed""",Not Verified | Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. My wife and I flew Singapore Air for first time and were very impressed. Economy seats the best we’ve had (and we travel a lot). Food and beverage service good and cabin crew were very efficient. Very good selection for inflight entertainment system. Highly recommended.
2019-02-12,8,8,"""seat width is narrower""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding, while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly. I wish that cabin seat space for Economy passengers could be maintained, given that the vast majority of us travel this way."
2019-02-10,10,10,"""attentive and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Cape Town via Singapore. As usual, they are famous of their top notch quality, service, and efficiency. Crews were very attentive and helpful. Upon boarding the aircraft, you could already feel their warmth hospitality. Food is good and IFE is fantastic. Cabin crew go around with drinks and snacks in the mid of flight very frequent (every 20 mins) which is hardly seen on the other major airlines. It's definitely worth it for the price I pay for. I will choose to fly with SIA again."
2019-02-10,10,10,"""so nice and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Cape Town to Singapore via Johannesburg. Friendly crew and fantastic service. The flight was 98% pax loading and cabin crew were really busy attending to passengers' needs. However, they remained professional and attentive. They are so nice and friendly. New aircraft, nice inflight entertainment system, delicious food, ample amenities in the toilets. Will definitely fly with them again."
2019-02-07,8,8,"""Would definitely recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | Wellington to Mumbai via Melbourne / Singapore. What can I say about this airline — always has been my favourite and always will be. Everything from check-in, boarding, IFE, meals, baggage – went smoothly. Cabin crew were as gracious as usual. Would definitely recommend. Only perk: this was somewhat an expensive ticket (but I would definitely pay the extra and fly SQ, than other airlines that fly the route), Singapore Airlines can definitely work on competitive pricing."
2019-02-07,3,3,"""No pillows available""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Denpasar. Poor flight. Average food. No pillows available at the economy cabin. Old aircraft. Seats at the vertical position very uncomfortable. Ground service unpolite.
2019-02-06,7,7,"""journey was just about okay""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Bali via Singapore. I flew to Australia with Singapore Airlines 5 years ago and the service was out of this world, amazing. I flew last October with them to Bali and back and it seems that standards have slipped. It seems there are a lot more male stewards on board now and they seem to give worse service than the female stewardesses. Male stewards seemed disorganised, flustered and abrupt compared to the female stewardesses who were very organised and polite. The airline needs to have standard procedures that staff follow. We had an issue with my partners meal being vegetarian nut free and Singapore Airlines were less than helpful. They served him nuts and or meat in a few of his meals, luckily he didn't eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didn't exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we weren't lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment. We didn't pay to be sat together and yet we still were on each leg of the journey. I'm giving it all a 7 because the journey was just about okay, it wasn't amazing like it was last time I flew with them"
2019-02-06,10,10,"""best in its category""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish. Even at cruising altitude, the flavours and aroma of the dish was well preserved. I highly recommend the SIA Business Class - best in its category."
2019-02-04,10,10,"""cabin crew were very polite""","✅ Trip Verified | Rome to Singapore. This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat. However, to convert to bed mode, you will need a flight attendant to pull down the seat back from the upright position. This is the main bugbear of the Business Class seat. No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits. As with other Singapore Airlines flights, the cabin crew were very polite, gracious and helpful and were able to anticipate passengers’ needs. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best in the category. Wifi was available on this flight. For business class passengers, the first 30 MB is free and after that you can purchase additional MB depending on your needs up to 200MB for US$ 25. The connection speed was reasonably fast - sufficient to upload a few Facebook photos."

Starting with the food: as vegetetarians we were offered a wide range of delicious Asian dishes. The portions were large, we got 2 starters, one main, 2 desserts plus snacks on a only 2 h 30min flight. Furthermore the cabin crew was outstandingly attentive, polite and friendly. We were on the flight SQ188 from Singapore to Hanoi on 25/01/19. Thank you to the crew once more for this pleasant experience!"

On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing."

I had a hard time selecting seats online even though I paid for seat selection. I had to call customer service 7 times to get my seats.

Food: excellent without being flamboyant."
2019-01-18,9,9,"""big improvement in service""","Not Verified | Apart from my Mileage Plus problem, the IFE, crew attitude and food were amazing. They mostly gave me Salmon for my seafood meals. They were also willing to answer to my curiosity about the laughter coming from the rear galley. Another problem encountered was the Wi-Fi because I had to pay for it. However, neither the Wi-Fi nor my Mileage Plus problems were as big as the problem encountered in 2014. I can say, quite a big improvement in service from 2016. All in all, the problems (Mileage Plus & Wi-Fi) were much smaller"
2019-01-18,3,3,"""ended up with an economy meal""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Brisbane via Singapore. Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer. I contacted the airline but they will not cover it."
2019-01-16,6,6,"""The seats are smaller""","✅ Trip Verified | Last time I flew with Singapore Airlines two years ago I was really impressed so I was excited to travel with them again. We boarded in sections efficiently and were warmly welcomed on board. The seats are smaller and the pitch tighter. We departed on time and as soon as airborne the teen in front of me reclined her seat the screen was a hands length away from my face. Shame that this more expensive airline has effectively negated the positives of flying with them. Yes you still get hot refresher towels and the entertainment choice was pretty good. The food was okay, nothing special but adequate if you like beef. We were seat 45, and the only option left was the beef. The toilets were kept clean and we arrived into Changi on time. However it is the tight seats at premium price I have an issue with. I am divided as to whether I’d recommend, it’s safe and reliable so I’d say yes. However do not expect anything special."
2019-01-08,1,1,"""different airline via Moscow""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines is a totally different airline when taking the route Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, café or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure. It is always way more cheap going through DME to and from Singapore than through LHR, FRA or CPH. Avoid Singapore Airlines flying to and from Stockholm through Moscow."
2019-01-01,6,6,"""experience onboard quite standard""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Jakarta. 9 years since I last took Singapore Airlines. Online check-in process easy, I managed to call the hotline to change my seat to get an exit row with my parents which was done easily. SQ did even bother to send us an SMS to warn us about the French strikes blocking the roads and to go early to the airport subsequently. Very good point. I find the quality of service onboard below of that of few years ago, food standard and bland, staff with good hard-skills though (responsive, efficient and professional) but could be better - they talk very fast, robotic gestures and could be more smiling. On our inbound leg, they ran out of one food option which left us very disappointed. Seats on the Boeing 777-300ER larger and more comfortable compared with that of other premium airlines. For the outbound Jakarta-Singapore leg, they asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight, so that we could have more buffer time transiting in Singapore for our next flight to Paris and not being too much in a hurry, which was a very good point. All in all, very good ground service, but experience onboard quite standard. I place this experience on par with 4-star airlines such as Emirates, but below the 5-Star Qatar Airways. Good value for money though."
2018-12-29,6,6,"""wanted 2200$ for upgrade""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Brisbane. Seems like service / food is getting worse slowly over time.

Flight attendants were elegantly efficient - the female flight attendants were strikingly lissome. Sitting configuration was 3-4-3. Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard. Bathrooms were clean throughout. A good option over Lufthansa or United. Arrived more or less on time after a somewhat bumpy flight."
2018-12-24,6,6,"""seats are not very comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | The usual good ground service at Changi Airport. Aircraft was an upgraded 773ER with the new Y class product. Service on this almost 14h flight was good, with attentive staff. The seats are not very comfortable, thin padding and little legroom. IFE very good. Food was below average for such a long flight. The 777 as usual, pretty noisy."
2018-12-23,9,9,"""crew were proactive with drinks""","✅ Trip Verified | Departing SIN-LHR on the redeye flight (departing 1 am), this means a group of grumpy and tired travellers. Took the front row bulkhead seat in PE on Boeing 777-300ER which gives quite a lot of legroom, the downside is the the inflight entertainment (IFE) system is tucked away on the floor, in a it's own separate housing. I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can. Overall, a good experience especially now that PE pricing appears to be equivalent to the prices from competitors such as Lufthansa."
2018-12-23,5,5,"""Food average and service slow""","Not Verified | Danang to Adelaide via Singapore. Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service, however, the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight (which was code shared on SQ ticket) was very average. Old plane, the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight - no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice, a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing. New A350 has poor leg room and when the person in front reclined i could not bend my legs and had to keep them straightened under the seat in front. IFE very average. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly Singapore again."
2018-12-23,4,4,"""experience was less convincing""","✅ Trip Verified | My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit, but to sleep it is not comfortable at all: too hard, too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient, sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again."
2018-12-22,4,4,"""really a disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Singapore Airlines A380 business from Zürich to Singapore in November 2018, and it was really a disappointment. Prior to my flight, I pre-ordered cordon blue for my dinner. It was just bad. Although the business section was not full, the flight attendants kept forgetting to deliver my drinks. During dinner, they offered red or white wine, and when I asked for a diet coke, they got lost completely. When I ordered a coffee, they gave me the coffee long after I finished my dessert but never delivered the stirrer. The business seat is extremely uncomfortable. The cushion is hard covered with a thin layer of leather cover. Even adding the bedsheet won't help. The armrests are a piece of small folding plastic, I couldn't rest my arms comfortably on them. When I reclined the seat, I was unable to stretch my legs due to design of the leg room. One has to curve his/her legs to fit the shape of the leg room and it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep like that. The quality of the image and sound of entertainment is below average. They offered limited movie selections. I am usually very easy going with airlines and I don't like to spend time to write reviews. However the newly designed business seats in Singapore airline are unacceptable. Singapore airline should pay more attention to improve their seats, foods and services."
2018-12-21,10,10,"""Excellent service all the way""","✅ Trip Verified | Excellent service all the way from Stavanger, first with SAS to Copenhagen, then on to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I choose Singapore Airlines for the entire trip from Stavanger - Singapore - Melbourne - Mildura- Melbourne - Perth then back to Stavanger via Singapore and London Heathrow mainly because they are part of the Star Alliance Group. All flights left on time and arrived earlier that scheduled. The service was excellent throughout. I particularly enjoyed the trip from Copenhagen to Singapore where I met a delightful young lady who was a member of the cabin crew. She took time to chat even though they were quite busy. I have flown with Singapore Airlines several times before"
2018-12-19,5,5,"""Disappointed this time""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. Among all the times I have flown with Singapore Airlines, this trip did not feel like Singapore Airlines at all. Firstly, there was a slight delay and the ground staff did not provide any information whatsoever. A bad start to the journey. After boarding the plane, I could feel that the cabin crew lacked warmth and hospitality. Shortly after takeoff, the cabin crew came round to serve the children first. They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy! When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the ‘superior quality’ Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that. Disappointed with Singapore Airlines this time round. The only good point of this trip was that we could fly in their new Boeing 787-10 with improved amenities. But other than that, this flight could not be recognised as from Singapore Airlines!"
2018-12-18,9,9,"""polite as usual""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Bangkok. Seat was very comfortable. Legroom was great and cabin crew were very polite as usual. The meal was delicious and it was nice of them to offer ice cream as a dessert. Inflight entertainment was also good but could have more options. Even though we were flying in one of the old A330s, this Singapore Airlines experience was amazing. Definitely would try them again."
2018-12-16,7,7,"""problem was my Mileage Plus""","Not Verified | Singapore to Newark. Cabin crew attitude, IFE & food were amazing. The only problem that I had with them was my Mileage Plus, both the cabin crew on the outbound flight and the ground staff in Newark barely knew anything about it. I asked the outbound flight crew about my Mileage Plus, they told me to consult the ground crew who just said both airlines are members of Star Alliance. He wasn't even sure if Mileage Plus members flying on Singapore Airlines were able to access United lounges. However he did tell me that Mileage Plus users (me inclusive) had to upgrade to Gold before accessing a Kris Flyer lounge but that seemed to be the only thing he knew about Mileage Plus."
2018-12-14,1,1,"""disappointed this time""","✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Singapore, with business class seated at 12A, the cabin was amazing, nice facilities with good ambience, cabin crews look nice, however some of the cabin crew are very robotic, there was no genuine care or personal touch from them. During the meal service, there was no one asking me to refill the drinks when crews saw my empty whisky glass, is it very expensive? Most of the crews without any anticipations for passengers. I can remember a female crew, when I asked for help to lay the bed back before landing, she asked me to carry her service tray for her, exchange? When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry! All the small details reflected that there is no attention for the customers, but some of the SQ flights I took before was so different! Honestly speaking, I was not comfortable this time and I feel there is no consistency for the cabin crew. Really disappointed this time and not worth as a elite member anymore."
2018-12-14,10,10,"""outstanding in their service""","✅ Trip Verified | Barcelona to Manila via Milan / Singapore. Upon arrival in Milan, a new group of cabin crew took over. This new team has been exceptionally outstanding in their service, beyond the normal that SQ is known for. When I asked for a cup of coffee, the steward served it with a small chocolate bar. In between meals, they served apple fruit; many minutes later, they served potato chips. These were additional foods than the normal snacks and drinks they served. The cabin crew were always visible throughout the flight, SQ377 on 28 Nov 2018. It’s like in economy class served like in business class."
2018-12-14,1,1,"""No kids menu provided""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Singapore via Sydney. No kids menu provided for a 2.5 year old, they said they did not have any. The age is mentioned when you book the ticket. They gave instant noodles which is not I am some thing paying for, the flight includes meals. We are non-vegetarians but other children with kids menu did not had a vegetarian option either."
2018-12-12,10,10,"""an impeccable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Zurich. I am impressed by this amazing latest Business Class product on the super silent A380. The seat has an incredible amount of privacy, plenty of functionalities and storage options and it is wonderfully set-up. The selection of movies is extensive and it comes with a big HD touch-screen. Food was great and the service, as usual on Singapore Airlines, was phenomenal. They remain my favourite airline out there. Particularly on this route, they put their code-share partner SWISS to a big shame. Overall, an impeccable flight, from the ground to the air."
2018-12-09,1,1,""" below subpar performance""","✅ Trip Verified | Surabaya to Singapore. Worst airline in terms of punctuality. I am a frequent flier and i took this flight pretty often. For a premium airline (which is like really premium because Singapore Airlines price themselves higher than other airlines flying the same route) they are offering below subpar performance. Well, taking note their “getting you there on-time” slogan. They obviously getting us there but not on-time. One of the worst airlines where it comes to reliability and accountability."
2018-12-09,7,7,"""the seats are very comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Johannesburg. Check in and formalities were super efficient as is normal at Changi. The flight is at the unsocial hour of 01.30, recently changed from 02.00. Unfortunately only the scheduled time has changed. We were 30 minutes late, and it seems that this is the norm for this flight, and an extra half hour of sitting around at the time in the morning is frustrating. Boarding when started was efficient. The premium economy cabin is relatively spacious with ample space for storage, and the seats are very comfortable. A pre-take off drink, as is the norm on other airlines premium economy would have been very welcome after the wait. After take off drinks were served. Champagne is offered, but in a tiny plastic faux wine glass, and other drinks are also served in plastic tumblers that seem to become progressively smaller. Due to the timing only a light snack is offered. Although this was quick there was a long wait for coffee or drinks top up to be offered, and tables cleared, as there are no dedicated premium economy crew. Service is the same as economy, and although Singapore Airlines economy is amongst the best it does not match the premium economy service of other airlines such as Qantas. Overall the comfort and space are excellent, but the service level is economy - on all 4 premium economy flights on this trip the curtains between the cabins were left open."
2018-12-08,6,6,"""overall flight was okay""","Not Verified | Sydney to Singapore. In Sydney, ground staff are particularly efficient. Aircraft was showing its age and perhaps an upgrade is required. I am unsure if it is the timing of the flight or the duration, however, the service lacked the upbeat and positive enthusiasm that SIA is known for, smiles were limited. I must commend the work of the senior flight steward who took excellent care of his passengers and came to check on them every few hours. The meals were average, not necessarily the best. They should allow passengers to know what is being served in the special meals category. Entertainment system didn’t respond either. However, the overall flight was okay, however, I have noted SIA for better service particularly on the SYD-SIN sector."
2018-12-05,2,2,"""never use Singapore Air anymore""","✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. It was my first and last time to use Singapore Airlines. Both our flights had delayed for total 5 hours, which caused us to miss our next flight to Kuching. In addition, the food was really worse. I will never use Singapore Air anymore."
2018-12-04,8,8,"""I was pleasantly surprised""",✅ Trip Verified | Flew with SQ468 on the 27th of November out of Singapore and I was pleasantly surprised! The aircraft was in a top notch condition and the food was by far the best food I have ever tasted on an airline. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and were very courteous. I should particularly mention how they look after toddlers very well on board. Load factor was full however this wasn’t a challenge for the team at all. The only drawback of an otherwise excellent flight was the fact that the entertainments system malfunctioned so much that I ultimately gave up and went to sleep.
2018-11-27,1,1,"""service in Sydney unprofessional""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Hong Kong via Singapore. The service that I received in Sydney Airport was so unprofessional. The ticket that I bought is student ticket, so I got 10KG more baggage allowance. However, the staff said that my baggage are overload (43kg in total). I understand that baggages are overloaded, and I was happy to pay for the extra 3kg, so I asked the staff how much I have to pay for the extra KGs, she answer AUD270. So I chose to repack my baggage since I think it is more expensive than I expected. after I repacked (1kg extra), the staff asked if I can pay for the extra or not (I was surprised, since it is just 1kg more). Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well. I do not normally complain about the quality of the food as long as they are acceptable, however, I did not think that it is in an acceptable quality from world No. 1 airline. Thirdly, I am not sure if all airlines are like this or not, however, from the meal menu, they have 3 courses to choose, I was informed that they only have 2 courses though. The seat of A380 is alright, but not okay for the B777 since it is way too old. I did not think the staff of SQ is friendly too, you can tell that the staff of my aisle are tired of the job and did not want to serve. I had a really high expectation in SQ since it ranked as the No1 airline, however, my experience tell me that it is not."
2018-11-25,9,9,"""fantastic service""",✅ Trip Verified | Flew short-haul flight from Seoul to Singapore with an A330. The plane is not very old (9 years) but had already old fashioned seats (no flat beds) and old entertainment. Both latter are the sole critical points in this experience that have been compensated by a fantastic crew with fantastic service. No airline can ever beat Singapore airlines when it comes to onborad service. A very attentive cabin crew with a very friendly and professional purser. Drinks were great and meal was fantastic that comes as usual with sate as appetizer.
2018-11-24,9,9,"""best business class experience""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Singapore. Having flown long-haul with various airlines over the years, and with Singapore Airlines to Asia before, we opted to use them again as they offer good value and service. We booked direct with the airline, which was cheaper than any aggregator sites - we had intended to fly premium economy, but when booking managed to get a business class outbound journey for almost the same price. The experience was excellent - from the business class SilverKris Lounge at LHR to the onboard service. The plane we were on had the relatively new business class seats, which were superbly comfortable and afforded a truly relaxing journey, with a good range of entertainment, food and drink (we used the 'Book the Cook' to have our own choice from the extensive menu). The wifi was also reasonable even if a 30MB allowance is meagre for a near 12.5 hour flight! The overall service was attentive without being over-bearing and the staff were always smiling - our every request was met and reinforced our view that Singapore Airlines offer the best business class experience among the top airlines."
2018-11-22,10,10,"""service was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Munich via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has always lived up to its name and quest for excellence. The plane used for the Singapore to Munich leg of the flight has wider seats, wider TV monitor and wider aisle. The cabin crew service was excellent and attending to our needs. The inflight entertainment has more movie choices as compared to last month when I used this airline on return flight to India."
2018-11-20,1,1,"""wine which I don't like""","✅ Trip Verified | I was disgusted with my flight from Auckland to Singapore. I found the food inedible, wine was a sauvignon which I don't like, I asked for Chardonnay just got a no. Toilets were dirty. We have a suit hanger when boarding to be hung and when we disembarked we saw it in the floor, when I asked why it was just dumped on the floor instead of hung up they had a no response attitude. Second leg to Heathrow I am just boarding now and dreading the overnight flight. Will not use them again."
2018-11-17,7,7,"""atmosphere was cold""","✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Manila via Singapore. The crew on the Singapore - Manila leg of the flight, SQ918 were stern or not in the mood to serve on this flight. We were still offered the usual food and hot towels, but the atmosphere was cold at that section of the plane."
2018-11-15,6,6,"""premium economy is ordinary""","Not Verified | Singapore to Sydney. I think Singapore Airlines is overall a very good airline but I think their premium economy compared to Qantas is ordinary. No curtain separating cabins, no welcome drink, meals out of aluminium containers. The only difference to economy is better seats. Not worth the extra money and not special."
2018-11-01,10,10,"""a great cabin crew""",Not Verified | We flew from Singapore to Manchester on Sunday 28th October and can honestly say it was the best economy flight we have travelled on. Very comfortable seats tasty food and snacks Exceptionally clean toilets and most of all a great cabin crew.

As it was airline mistake, they booked me on the next flight departing to Hong Kong after 5 hours. The staff at Singapore Airport arrival was not much helpful, they gave me SGD 15 meal voucher and asked me to wait in the public waiting area."
2018-10-27,10,10,"""offered far better privacy""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Delhi i November 2017. The A380 was a bit old, but clean. Unlike the first class seat on board of the Boeing 777-300ER, the suite offered far better privacy. The best part was the bed; it was the most comfortable bed on the sky I've experienced. Service and catering was second to none, as usual."
2018-10-26,10,10,"""best in the world""","✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Singapore. Everything about this flight is top notch. The seat was super wide and comfortable. Service was so attentive that sometimes I felt like I was being watched. Food was delicious and beautifully plated. One minor complain: I booked airport transfer through Singapore Airlines, and the car came early, but then the airline's check-in counter at HKG was not open until less than 2 hours before departure, leaving me wandering around the check-in area for over an hour. Despite this, I still think Singapore Airlines deserves to be the best in the world."
2018-10-26,10,10,"""10 out of 10 for the flight""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London Heathrow. A good flight with Singapore Airlines on a half full aircraft that allowed many in economy to have two seats each. Service quick and efficient and lunch and dinner of great quality. Water juice served constantly. Singapore set the bar for the best that economy anywhere can offer. Pity the app and website were not up to that standard. All in all 10 out of 10 for the flight. Also the ticket to London was very cheap too bought on line from an agents
2018-10-24,7,7,"""Cabin staff great""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Sydney via Singapore. Mumbai Lounge was 5 Star, ground staff poor Language and Other Skills. Brand New A350. Cabin staff great, great Food. The Singapore Lounge was 5 Star. Old A380, cabin Staff great, great Food."
2018-10-15,9,9,"""cabin crew were superb""","✅ Trip Verified | Cape Town to Brisbane via Singapore. This was my first time on Singapore Airlines and the service was outstanding and the cabin crew were superb. The A350 is a wonderful airplane and nearly silent. That was wonderful. The food was delicious, especially given that it is airline food. The cabin was uncrowded and well laid out in business class. The lavatories were spacious, clean and well supplied. I was surprised by no amenity kits and no pajamas in business class on long flights, and the crew did not automatically offer to assist with turning the seat into a bed. The angle at which you could lay flat was on a slant because of where your feet have to go. The cabin music, when playing, is cloying, saccharin and unpleasant. There was free WiFi in business class but I could not get it to work on the SIN-BNE leg and no one on board could solve the problem."
2018-10-11,9,9,"""my best economy flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to London via Singapore. Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn’t get answer on the phone to see if it’s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn’t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ). When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available, ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible. I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) . They have a foot-paddle to open the trash bin in the restrooms. When I got to Singapore, I asked at the gate if there might be a 3-seater available for the flight to Hong Kong. They assigned me to a 2-seater by the window."
2018-10-10,10,10,"""really comfortable seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Manchester. My return flight was even better then the outgoing one! Again really comfortable seats, I got nearly 8 hours of sleep during this 13.5hr flight. The entertainment was top notch as was the food and the service. Great airline and I hope to fly with them again"
2018-10-10,10,10,"""A fantastic experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. A fantastic experience. Good service and hospitality accorded to me. Nice leg room and array of entertainment options. The transits were well-handled, and despite a short rest at Moscow Airport (less than 1 hour), the plane was cleaned and the next leg from Moscow to Stockholm seems like taking off in a new plane. Staff were attentive and helpful."
2018-10-07,9,9,"""they lacked international food""",✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Singapore. The second time I flew on the A380. The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional. The only things that bothered me on this particular flight was they lacked international food to serve that I was served Indian food which I’m not used to. Another hitch was the on-line check-in where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only. Thank you.
2018-10-05,9,9,"""exceptional service by the crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Bangalore via Singapore. As usual, exceptional service by the crew.

Particular thanks to the crew on our Singapore to Hong Kong flight on the 20th September at 1pm. the cabin crew were amazing in recovering some property that I had left on the previous aircraft and managed to deliver it to my seat before take off. The meals were lovely and cabin crew were fantastic with the children. Thank you for amazing flights and service, will definitely fly with them again."
2018-10-04,9,9,"""still a pleasant journey""","✅ Trip Verified | Some hurdles but still a pleasant journey. Flew from Jakarta to Singapore early in the morning. Despite some problems in overall journey, but I appreciate that they wanted to serve the best service that they can give. First, I could not use self-service check-in kios due to my single name, no gate agent was available at the moment might be because they have not started to work yet. But I didn't wait too long until they started to work. Secondly, limited choice of meal. I seated at the back of the plane therefore I became the last person to be served in the flight. Due to limited in-flight meal with chicken, left me fish which I less like it. One cabin crew apologized tried to persuade me to accept the meal, but I appreciate another cabin crew tried to find any meal options including business class."
2018-10-04,10,10,"""A fantastic airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Beautiful plane with comfortable seats. Did not require full recline to be comfortable in economy. Good legroom. Entertainment system has a touch screen with about 100 movies and large selection of TV, music. The plane has multiple charging docks - one USB and one standard per seat. Food was great. My vegan meal was a simple fried rice but it was tasty and satisfying. My son was served before the formal meal service - children served first. Call for service was attended to very quickly. Wifi available in flight but I did not try. A fantastic airline."
2018-10-02,3,3,"""never had a worse experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to New York. Both my original flight from JFK to Frankfurt (21 Aug) and my return flight (2 Oct) were fraught with problems on the booking end. Upgrades were a struggle to get processed. Seat selection was very hard. Customer Service was very difficult to contact, and once on the phone, they were largely unable to provide any answers or any help. Several emails have gone unanswered. I have never had a worse experience with an airline."
2018-10-02,10,10,"""seats were decently spaced out""","✅ Trip Verified | Even on a smaller aircraft like this A330, seats were decently spaced out in economy and cabin crew service puts some airlines to shame. Hainan chicken rice (one of the best tasting ones I've had) + Magnum ice cream. Even though IFE on their newer aircraft like the A350s are better, the older aircraft such as this A330 wasn't bad. Cabin crew helped to hang our jackets/garment bags, hot towels, snacks & drinks on top of the meals, metal crockery. I've had the chance to fly (economy) on their A380, B777-300ER & B777-200ER. The B772 is an older plane and it's IFE could use an upgrade, and the new retrofitted A380 tends to have slightly smaller legroom than the rest. The 773s and A350s are super comfortable. SQ is still a world class airline."
2018-10-01,10,10,"""a very charming service""","✅ Trip Verified | It was an amazing flight with a very charming service, with four flight attendants for us 20 people in the business class. They were always present, very friendly, every time with a smile on their face and fulfilled all wishes immediately. Everything was fine, from the champagne after entering the aircraft, to the excellent dinner with a lovely red wine until the Singapore Sling, which was served shortly before landing. Any time I would like to use this service again."
2018-09-29,10,10,"""Cabin staff were good""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Tokyo via Singapore. Used the airline quite a few times, they have never disappointed us. Booking was convenient as always.The ground service was good, they requested us whether we would like to voluntarily self check in, which took some time though.The seats were comfortable as usual. Entertainment was good. Food and beverages were excellent, I really like their cocktail, Singapore sling. Cabin staff were good."
2018-09-28,9,9,"""Service was fantastic""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. Older plane but comfortable seats with decent recline and leg room, although probably assisted by my companion and I sharing 3 seats. My vegan meal was a nicely crumbed eggplant with tomato and string beans. My companion had a decent beef rendang meal. Both were tasty but too salty. Entertainment variety was good. KrisShop had a very good range of products too. Service was fantastic. This is my favorite airline."
2018-09-27,1,1,"""don't take responsibility""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Frankfurt. I was a frequent flyer with Singapore Airlines. I was redeeming my miles and booked my ticket through SIA directly. I received E-Ticket confirmation. But, when I reached airport with my family, they told me my child ticket (3 month) had not been issued. They didn't knew why. They ask me to pay a full price one way ticket at $800, instead of the $102 it was supposed to cost. I sent a letter after the trip and ask explanation and reimbursement. They replied after 1.5 month. They said they made a mistake with the code share partner and apologised, but they didn't reimburse the difference between what I was suppose to pay and what I paid without having any choice at the airport. In short they made a mistake but don't take responsibility. I have stopped using this airline. In addition we were not even together on the first row with bassinet despite there were available seats."
2018-09-26,8,8,"""back to UK was very good""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore airlines return from London to Manila via Singapore. Going to Manila the plane was a let down. The tv was not working properly, I nearly lost my temper because I had to call the staff 3 times to fix it. In fairness, she had been very accommodating, just you have to wait a while. However, the airline going back to UK was very good. I noticed, and this is not just for Singapore Airlines, all flights that I had been in, going to Manila are the low quality/substandard/old planes, whereas, going back to the UK are the excellent ones."
2018-09-25,1,1,"""No refund is forthcoming""",✅ Trip Verified | Could not fault the airline until they cancelled a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong on 16th September 2018. This was due to a pending typhoon affecting Hong Kong. No refund is forthcoming. A small discount was offered on another flight at a future time. This is not possible for us. The pre booked hotel in Hong Kong is reimbursing us the full amount less a small administration fee. If they can do this why can't a large airline do the same.
2018-09-24,10,10,"""Economy never felt so good""",✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Singapore. Great flight. Bearing in mind it was a 13 hour flight it never felt like that at all. The staff were great and the food and entertainment were really good. In between the meals the staff would come round with drinks and get you what ever snack you want. The inflight entertainment was amazing so much choice. Economy never felt so good.
2018-09-23,5,5,"""amateurish attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | On a recent flight from Perth to Singapore, I was asked by the cabin staff whether I preferred beef rendang or western-style chicken for dinner. I asked for beef and was told that the beef sets on her trolley had run out, and I would have to wait. I was expecting her to get me the beef set from another trolley when, just seconds later, the stewardess abruptly placed a chicken set on my tray. She opened the foil to show me the contents and said that the chicken “looks good too”. Without further explanations, she went on to serve the others. I was bewildered by her unprofessional and amateurish attitude. Not wanting to create a fuss and feeling tired, I just accepted what was given. This incident might seem trivial, but such small things do make an impression and affect my decision to fly with the national carrier again. The crew members just seemed to be rushing to get their jobs done, and the warmth of the Singapore Girl that is so widely advertised simply could not be felt. Apart from personal grooming and the technical aspects of their duties, I wonder if soft skills and proper service attitude are sufficiently emphasized during their training."
2018-09-21,7,7,"""great flight with Singapore Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | Ho Ch Minh to Singapore. Everything went good except for the entertainment overall. Check in was not that crowded. Security check at SGN was well organized. Boarding was efficient and we’re one of the last onboard. Flight departed on time and we get good choice of food containing Fish and rice onboard with another drinks served, they are all delicious. However the entertainment was below the standard of Emirates. The staff we’re good onboard. Overall, still a great flight with Singapore Airlines."
2018-09-18,10,10,"""The meal was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore to Denpasar. I got great service from a very charming crew. They spoiled me from entering the plane until landing. They were always present and fulfilled all wishes immediately. I ordered in advance over ""Book the Cook"" a ""Grilled Beef with Balsamic Onion Sauce"". The meal was excellent. I'm looking forward to my next flight with Singapore Airlines."
2018-09-15,3,3,"""have to pay for the change""","✅ Trip Verified | Three of us arrived early at Jakarta check in counter at around 2.45pm. We requested to change our flight to earlier 5pm flight, the first counter lady rejected our request and we went to another counter and he helped us to change flight but then told us we have to pay for the change. We declined to take the change of flight and later we were informed there was delay for one hour to our flight. Why did SIA charge for additional fee knowing that there was a flight delay and make their customers to wait for 4 hours."
2018-09-12,1,1,"""delayed the refund""","✅ Trip Verified | Guangzhou to Denpasar via Singapore booked for December 2018. They rescheduled the connected flight in which made my second flight 1 day earlier than my first flight (both are Singapore Airlines). I asked for cancellation of the whole trip. They delayed the refund for almost a month even I called four times. With only refund of the flight, they still keep those I paid for the seats and said it's non-refundable. I understand if it's my personal reason to cancel the flight, I wouldn't have asked for the refund of the tickets, not to mention the seats."
2018-09-12,8,8,"""service was pleasant""","✅ Trip Verified | Midnight flight departing Singapore to London on A380 in economy class, not the favourite way to start a trip. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, although the sheer size of the A380 makes for a busy boarding process. We found ourselves on one of SQ's newest A380-800 aircraft, decked out in the new economy class setting with updated seating and AVOD. This configuration has economy and premium economy on the lower deck, and the very premium seats on the upper deck. We were in the 2nd most front row of economy, near to the galley. Seats were relatively comfortable (by Economy standards), with a new styled headrest. The AVOD was presented with a large touch screen, and is now line with the likes of Emirates. Food choices were pretty good (mostly edible), and service was pleasant, if not enthusiastic. We departed and arrived on time, and it was as tolerable as long-haul economy can be, I believe."
2018-09-09,7,7,"""very comfortable flight""","Not Verified | We have previously flown Singapore Airlines in economy, and have always been impressed with the service. This trip was our first experience of Singapore Airlines premium economy. Priority check-in and boarding was quick and easy, with a friendly welcome and offer of assistance from the crew. The premium economy cabin is just three rows in a 2-4-2 configuration, and there is plenty of locker space. The seats are comfortable with a good level of recline and good leg room. There is a calf support, but this serves little purpose, plus a leg rest from the seat in front. Their is a 13inch HD entertainment screen with excellent sound reducing earphones. Having experienced Singapore Airlines excellent economy class service levels, expectations of an even better premium experience are unfortunately not met. Service is economy level. There are no pre- take off drinks, and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off, it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort, and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well. However we were left with the feeling that Singapore Airlines somewhat belatedly introduced premium economy to keep up with their competitors, but have not totally embraced the concept."
2018-09-09,6,6,"""a very comfortable flight""","Not Verified | Singapore to Brisbane. We have flown this route several times previously flying economy, before the introduction of the A350, so were looking forward to the daylight flight on premium economy. Check in and boarding could not be criticized, effortless and quick, with smiling welcoming staff. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant, with lots of locker space, and the seats are comfortable, with good recline and ample leg room. For a daylight flight the entertainment system is paramount, and this is top notch with a 13 inch hadscreen, superb noise cancelling headphones, and a vast selection of programmers. However when it comes to service, standards drop to economy level. No pre-take off drink, nor after take off drinks. A 1 hour wait until meal service, when drinks are served with the meal. Champagne is available, but wines are mediocre and served in plastic tumblers. The last time we flew this route in economy there was at least a proper glass on the tray, but now it is all plastic. Meals were brunch and then a hot snack later, with a choice of two dishes on each occasion, but out of both meals only the ice cream was good. During the flight the crew were very active, with frequent drink runs, and washrooms were well maintained. Overall a very comfortable flight, with an excellent crew, but a level of service not up to expectations for premium economy."
2018-09-08,10,10,"""excellent staff and service""","✅ Trip Verified | Adelaide to Paris via Singapore. Excellent staff and service. Always friendly, polite and smiling. Hot towels, frequent, drink runs, good food. Extra snacks and drinks available throughout the flight. I liked the drinks holder in seat backs. Seat comfortable. Blanket and pillow. The head support ""wings"" really help. Plenty of entertainment choices and reasonable screen size and quality. I didn't try the wifi. Toilets cleaned regularly during both flights. Baggage transit between flights went smoothly. Both flights were full and for the price, this is about as good as it is reasonable to expect an economy flight to be. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Singapore Air again. And the bonus. If you are going to have some hours between flights, transiting in Changi is the best place to do it. Plenty to do, or easy to get a rest in the airport. Lots of quality food options at excellent prices."
2018-09-04,9,9,"""cabin crew was amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok via Singapore. Singapore Airlines is for me one of the most elegant when it comes to the design in and out. I had finally an experience to fly with them which was very nice, the service of their cabin crew was amazing. Sincere service I would like to call it."
2018-08-31,4,4,"""such hard seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Hong Kong. New cabin I can t believe SQ spent so much in ""upgrading"" the business class seat which on 777-300 is way more elegant and comfortable. Still same awkward angle and I have never experienced such hard seats. Claustrophobic, narrow, hard and squeezing more seats. Will avoid as much as possible flying on the A380."
2018-08-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Singapore. Service was great, they keep on feeding you, the food was awesome. Its was a 16hr flight but I never felt tired or stress, the seats are great. They are the cheapest business class from the Philippines to the USA but they give the best service and product. I was just disappointed there was no Satay."
2018-08-27,8,8,"""I would fly them again""","Not Verified | Flew with Singapore Airlines on a round trip from Singapore to Shanghai return. The aircraft I flew from Shanghai - Singapore was an older A380. The seat was smaller than expected and I was uncomfortable. However the crew was very friendly and spoke many different languages. The food was not very good as compared to my Singapore to Shanghai leg, but it was definitely edible. IFE was ok, not the fastest IFE I've seen but it was sufficient. This flight was slightly below standard but it was fine. I would fly them again."
2018-08-26,10,10,"""Excellent service onboard""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Seoul return. Excellent service onboard. Refreshing hot towels were provided before each flight. Food may not be the best but still pretty good. Plenty of movies to choose from with the inflight entertainment, although the system looks rather old on the A330s."
2018-08-22,6,6,"""seats have seen better days""","✅ Trip Verified | Auckland to London via Singapore. When boarding the SIA A380 in Singapore I was saddened to see how tired the aircraft was looking on the outside and the inside compared to the Air New Zealand 787 I arrived on. The seats have definitely seen better days and struggling to get comfortable half way through the flight. Sat at the front of economy you could see how much better and new the premium economy seats and screens was compared to the aged economy seat, like two different airlines on the same aircraft. Crew like always had a smile on and did plenty of laps around offering water and cleaning. Toilets was also nice and clean and stocked with basic essentials, tooth brush, combs, moisturiser along with having hot towels before each meal helped you feel a bit more refreshed. Meals was ok, drink portions are terrible. Two sips and the lots gone. Feels like cost cutting is taking place."
2018-08-20,9,9,"""seems to have improved""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Seoul. Service seems to have improved since the last time I flew them on economy in December 2016. Hot towels and lots of drink refills even when flying over moderate turbulence. During the outbound flight, my inflight entertainment had no sound after an hour airborne and the crew initially wanted me to move to another seat at the rear of the plane but I rejected it as I had specifically chosen a seat on the wing for comfort. The leading crew and cabin manager eventually moved me to the first row of economy class on an aisle seat with extra legroom, insisting that I should enjoy my movie and sitcoms and also meant first to deplane! Service standards vary- local Singapore hires seem passionate and genuine but their overseas hires didn’t appear friendly. Inbound, the meal service did not start until 1.5 hours prior to landing as it was a redeye back to Singapore but the attendant serving my row was happy to heat up pot noodles for me. Chief steward was friendly and gave me a bag of free goodies having seen me carry two stuffed bears to ease my fear of it being extremely bumpy having read that the return flight would be going over a typhoon. Food option ran out but the crew let me have a vegetarian meal which tasted pretty good. Seat had issues reclining and two attendants pleasantly helped me make sure it worked despite taking 15 minutes or so. Both ways: inflight entertainment with plenty of movies and music to choose from. Would have flown them to LHR and back this winter if not for outrageously expensive winter fares exceeding 30 day stays!"
2018-08-19,10,10,"""crew extremely polite and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I flew Singapore Airlines with my spouse from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. We had booked the tickets around 3 months ahead which allowed us to get them at unimaginably cheap price. So given the overall quality of service we received was great bang for buck. We loved the interior which had nice Christmas decorations. The legroom was sufficient for an economy seat. The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again."
2018-08-19,3,3,"""unpleasant boarding experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Taipei to Singapore. Very unpleasant experience with boarding. They asked to check my boarding pass twice within one minute: the 1st time at the boarding gate, and then at the airplane entrance door. I understood that they did it that way due to their ""rigid security policy"", but did not train their staff to do it in a professional manner."
2018-08-14,10,10,"""best airline in the world""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. I had not flown Singapore Airlines for a long, long time and was looking forward to this 13 hr experience. They did not disappoint and had improved over the years. Check-in and boarding were painless and in particular, boarding was well organised. Inside there were the usual charming hostesses in traditional dress. The aircraft was clean and neat. The leg room was fine considering the distance involved, In-flight entertainment was so so good that I chucked away my Sudoku puzzle book and watched what was on offer. Meals were very good and the staff made sure that we were hydrated. There were no real queues for the toilets. Before I realised it we were descending to Singapore. Great experience with the best airline in the world!"
2018-08-13,10,10,"""my favorite carrier""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to New York. Friendly smiling crew made a huge difference on this flight. Good food and entertainment, comfortable seats, on time departure. I have used Singapore Airlines for over 30 years and they continue to be my favorite carrier."
2018-08-12,10,10,"""a perfect option so far""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Shanghai on 28th July 2018, it was a lovely morning, warm welcomed by the crews on board, seemed like the flight was not full on that day. Had ""book the cook"" US beef and it was really amazing, I could not agree more as it was the best beef I had before. Specially thanks to a lovely air stewardess, her service was really on top. Cabin was spacious. Its a perfect option so far."
2018-08-10,9,9,"""crew were very engaged""","✅ Trip Verified | Flying from Yangon to Singapore on mid morning flight, really showed that SilkAir struggles to match the SIA product. To be fair, we were accommodated on an Airbus A330-300, which has seatback IFE, wider seats and a generally more spacious ambience. Nonetheless, the in-flight meal for the 3 hour flight was just much better than the SilkAir product, and the IFE at least made the time pass faster. The A330 has a 2-4-2 configuration, which makes travelling as a couple or single slightly more enjoyable. The cabin crew were very engaged, going the extra mile for multiple drink servings."
2018-08-08,10,10,"""amazing short flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to Singapore. I now come back to fly with Singapore Airlines because they are named the “best airline” of 2018, but the service is the best for sure. The check in to boarding was great as usual. Onboard with a wonderful helping staff and crew. The IFE itself was limited compared to Emirates because it’s an old airplane with no power plug and smaller screens. The food was beef and rice which was delicious. Overall, short flight with Singapore Airlines means the best one ever had. What can I say is to say Thank you to all Singapore Airlines team for this amazing short flight."
2018-08-07,10,10,"""aircraft was perfect""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore. Singapore Airlines again demonstrated why it is the best airline. The flawless crew was always offering food and drinks during the whole flight, and always ready to do anything to make your flight great. The food is the best I've ever had on a flight, the IFE was just brilliant and the overall quality of the aircraft was perfect. Legroom and recline angle were exceptional. Simple details as the hot towel after takeoff and before landing make this airline special. Skytrax 5 stars well earned."
2018-08-04,9,9,"""it was comfortable enough""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to New York JFK. Check-In was acceptable at best, not very efficient. Although I ordered a wheel chair long ahead of time, i had to wait 20 min for it to arrive. LH has a special check-in area for handicapped people. I had pre-ordered a special meal, which was very good. It came as soon as lunch was served. Which is kind of interesting because, I like booking the SIA flight because they leave Frankfurt at 8:30 in the morning and arrive at JFK around 11, long before anybody else from Europe arrives, which is important in Terminal 4. So lunch was served at 10 am German Time. Why dont they give us a breakfast 9:15 and 2,5 hours before landing a lunch, which would make more sense. The flight was pretty packed, very classy not so many babies around. This A380-800 was built for Asians, but still it was comfortable enough because I am 6 feet 11. The IFE was pretty good, though the tv series were kind of old, movies were a year old but still acceptable. The Team was nice, but not as nice as i have seen them before. Leaving the plane I had to wait until everybody else was gone, but the wheelchair was waiting for me when left the plane. By the time i was through Immigration my luggage was already out."
2018-08-03,6,6,"""Crew were varying""","✅ Trip Verified | The early evening flight was a new A380. Food wasn't anything exceptional though but I should mention that Singapore airlines does go through excessive lengths even in economy class, for instance providing menus. The biggest let down was the breakfast with a cold muffin and some fruits which isn't what I expected on a flagship route because I have eaten better meals on short haul flights with SQ. Crew were varying. The ones that greeted us at the entrance were extremely pleasant but the ones in the rear economy class section were very serious and I saw barely any smiling. Still got the job done though. Inflight entertainment is out of this world and is extremely sophisticated and can keep you entertained for the full 8 hours."
2018-07-26,3,3,"""Meals were mediocre quality""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. Ticket was sold as 1 layover at Singapore. However flight stopped at Hong Kong and we were made to out for another security check. Three people family was forced to sit at three different seat including my minor child, Same meal was repeated. We were given last seat in the return journey. There was no cabin space given for our seat and hence we had to put our stuff scattered in the plane. Meals were also mediocre quality with no fruits and veggies or salad."
2018-07-25,10,10,"""has wider seat-TV screen""","✅ Trip Verified | Manila to Bangkok via Singapore. My first time to take a ride of this type of plane, the B787-10. It's spacious, has wider seat-TV screen, more legroom and a wider aisle that my cabin bag did not hit the arm chairs at any time."
2018-07-23,10,10,"""inflight meal was really premium""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Beijing. Took this flight in Apr 2018, the aircraft was pretty new, spacious, I reserved the ""Book the cook"" service prior to departure, the inflight meal was really premium, especially the lobster with rice. The inflight entertainment system was perfect, the screen was big. Ground staffs were friendly, same as the cabin crews."
2018-07-20,10,10,"""A great experience""","Not Verified | My wife and I flew this route on May 1st to Singapore, and then Singapore to Christchurch on May 16th. Good flights, great crew, attentive, approachable, Meals great, drinks plentiful, alcoholic and juices, water, tea, coffee etc, A bit rough flying over Australia, captain had seat belt sign on several times, as well as announcements from cabin crew, Very safety conscience. Clean toilets, rubbish removed promptly. A great experience, would fly this top rating airline again."
2018-07-13,3,3,"""disappointing experience""","✅ Trip Verified | My recent experience in business class was very subpar. First off, the seats were angled weird and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. The entertainment remote was also not very responsive. There were way too many announcements causing frequent interruptions in watching movies (and don't tell me they are necessary as I've never experienced so many announcements on any other airlines). I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals. They always asked me what I wanted to order and I had to remind them that I had booked the cook. On my last leg back home (Seoul to LAX), same problem occurred, but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast (despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing). They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me. The head flight attendant was apologetic and offered me a 100 Singapore Dollar voucher to use on in flight shopping. He told me it was good for one year, but I have no idea if I am going to take another Singapore Airlines flight within the next year, and especially not after this poor experience. This was such a disappointing experience."
2018-07-07,10,10,"""happy with the service and care""",✅ Trip Verified | I am very happy with the service and care provided during this trip. They also upgraded to Business class from Wellington to Melbourne. It was like a sweet and short trip. Thanks for this. Also changed my Bangalore ticket to a earlier flight saving me almost 18 hrs with a very nominal fees. I am very much obliged and grateful for this service. Singapore Airlines have earned a loyal customer today.
2018-07-05,8,8,"""did an excellent job""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Singapore on SQ242, began with very helpful and friendly ground staff in Sydney. The flight was 20 minutes late but flying time made up for the delay and got us in early. Similarly, the 777 was very well maintained and the entertainment was remarkable. Dinner was not up to it's expected standard however the refreshment that was provided prior to landing was excellent and sufficient. The cabin staff did an excellent job and I particularly observed how they take very good care of toddlers."
2018-06-24,5,5,"""totally forgettable""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bali. Singapore Airlines was disappointing. What happened to the ""Singapore Girl""? Outdated IFE, still using the remote control, poor screen quality and sound. No menu given before the meals nor aperitif proposed. Straight to the food, which was bland. There is wine on the cart but it is not proposed to passengers, one needs to ask for it. A lot of useless announcements from the attendants made this flight totally forgettable. They should shorten their flight safety announcement which, I believe, is one of the longest among carriers."
2018-06-24,7,7,"""very friendly flight attendant""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ856 From Singapore to Hong Kong on the A380 with a flight delay for an hour due to airspace. Flight attendant did not serve Singapore Sling during the delay as not in the air. First time I heard this explanation. When I asked for coffee, the attendant retorted at me as there is turbulence. Flight attendant very impatient. For the flight back via SQ871 on the A330 very friendly flight attendant and pilot who welcome the whole passenger and enjoy his job. I enjoy the A330 services on the way back."
2018-06-13,8,8,"""impressed with the journey""",✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with the overall journey with Singapore Airlines. The seating was very comfortable and easy to relax in. The cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. The service in the air was very good and professional. The menu (food and drinks) was good with a great selection for both. We were expecting a small travellers bag (toiletry) with tooth brush and other accessories for the long night trip (like other airlines do) but was not supplied. Only in the toilets we found some items. For the price of a business class ticket or any flight tickets they should have been supplied for the long trip.
2018-06-08,8,8,"""a very good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Davao to Zurich via Singapore. I had an enjoyable experience with Silkair and later on with Singapore Airlines. The 1st leg of the flight was good. Boarding was on time as the departure was. After boarding newspapers were offered, but I refused to get one. After takeoff, the crew took a while to start with the service, but the meal was very tasty and the quantity was good. The legroom on the flight was superb due I was seated at the emergency exit. Unfortunately the IFE was only on overhead screens, so it was quite boring flight. After the layover in Singapore, the ground handling for the 2nd leg was very good and boarding commenced with only slight delay. The service on this flight began shortly after takeoff, but it was a bit rushed during late dinner was served, and I didn't get the dessert. But since it was an ample and tasty dinner, I didn't mind at all since it was already 2am as well. The selection on IFE was superb, but the flight information is a bit outdated, since it was a non-refurbished aircraft. After I called FA for a mid-term snack an ample snack was served. Shortly before arrival a very tasty breakfast was served less rushed than the dinner. Overall the FA's did a great job! The legroom on the 2nd leg was a lot more narrow, but still it was a good legroom. Landing in Zurich was on time. I had a very good experience with Silkair and Singapore airlines and I will recommend to fly with SIA!"
2018-06-07,6,6,"""minimal service by cabin crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Los Angeles via Incheon. The aircraft was clean and the seats were noticeably narrower than the PE seat on the Singapore A380. Again I was disappointed by the minimal service by the cabin crew. I had looked forward to my flights on Singapore Airlines and found them to be lacking in attention to their passengers. I would fly Singapore again, but I would not go out of my way to do so as I did this time. I doubt that I would spend the extra money to move up to Premium Economy."
2018-06-05,1,1,"""redeem points is difficult""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Flying Premium Economy was disappointing, over rated seating and food was average and similar to Economy - apart from slight extra leg room, it was not premium at all. Service was below average. Transit in Singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. After a long time, am using my KrisFlyer points for my wife to travel Business Class from Melbourne to Rome via Singapore on in August 2018 whilst I am travelling on a Business Class ticket. My wife’s SIN-ROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking. Instead, Singapore Airlines wishes me to pay approx AUD$1,500 to upgrade my wife’s Business Saver Class to the next sub-class. This is unacceptable and disappointing. Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years, a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently, the airline is unable to assist. Based on poor treatment to-date in respect of item 3 above, it appears that Singapore Airlines is misleading with its KrisFlyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficult/a very long wait."
2018-06-04,8,8,"""seating very tight and cramped""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. This was the first time I used economy class after many years as I used business class for my business flights. I am a big fan of Singapore Airlines and a Solitaire PPS member with them, therefore it was an interesting experience to fly in economy again. Check in was fantastic as I was able to use the first class check in in Singapore which is a pleasant experience. Silver Kris first class lounge is in need of renovation as it is not in line with today’s standards of premium first class lounges. Boarding was on time and effortless, again as due to my status I was able to board first. Seating, the aircraft was an old 777-200 and the seating and equipment reflected this. Perhaps I was spoiled by flying business class but I found the seating very tight and cramped. The inflight entertainment was also very old and limited. I am aware that SIA is introducing the new B787 for the SIN to PER route, this change is well overdue. Another item is the the inflight duty free shipping, we have tried on 4 different flights to buy a certain perfume which is listed in their catalog but it was not available as well as other male colognes listed. There is no point of having a catalog on the plane when the items are not available. Cabin staff were doing a great job and well trained."
2018-06-03,10,10,"""as expected of a 5-star airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore return. Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated. The seat is slightly uncomfortable on the A330 in a full upright position but is fine once it can be reclined, even just slightly. They no longer places blankets in every seat for this route but they are available on request."
2018-05-23,8,8,"""very modern and high quality""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to London return via Singapore, with A-350 on both MEL-SIN legs, A-80 on SIN-LHR and B-777-300ER on LHR-SIN. Early departure from MEL and very efficient service. The A350 business class seat and fit-out is very modern and high quality. The A380 and B777 is a bit older but still good. Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason. Amenities were available in the bathroom, although I didn't realise this until the second leg. Perhaps they should announce it or tell you upon boarding, rather than leaving you to wait for a kit? Overall, very pleasant flights despite the length. On MEL-SIN-LHR, the flight arrived at Terminal 3 and departed Terminal 1, which was a bit disappointing for the national carrier's airport. I had gone to the lounge before realising my connecting flight was in a different terminal."
2018-05-21,10,10,"""was so pleasantly surprised""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Sydney via Singapore. I was travelling with my father in law and he was travelling outside India for the first time. I had requested for wheel chair assistance, but was hesitant about the extent of assistance provided and feasible. I was so pleasantly surprised to see that all my worries were reduced to nothing with the extent of co-operation, understanding and courteousness displayed by the staff. Hereon, I will be suggesting Singapore Airlines to everybody who asks me. A big thank you to the flight crew and ground staff for SQ 423 and SQ211 on 18th and 19th of May. Keep up the good work guys."
2018-05-16,1,1,"""refused the airport lounge""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Xiamen. I am extremely disappointed with Singapore Airlines! I am an United Gold customer. Before I booked my flight, I called Singapore Airlines to verify whether I can use the airport lounge due to my United Gold status. The staff gave me wrong info and as a result, I paid $100 more to book Singapore Airlines. However, at the airport, I was refused and was told that the staff gave me wrong info. They refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund. This is ridiculous! The service was not any better than United and I don't even get the choice of meal that I want because they didn't prepare enough (only 25% of the meal is fish)."
2018-05-15,6,6,"""trip quite disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | Wellington to Singapore. My trip was quite disappointing, the 777 aircraft are so old! The TV screen resolution is horrible. Entertainment options not the newest. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours because of push back issues. Service and food was just okay; nothing memorable. With the high prices they charge, I don't think it's worth it, but I still love the brand."
2018-05-09,9,9,"""service and food amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. Wanted to try the regional business class available on the brand new Boeing 787-10. Feeling like a cocoon, it is very private, entertainment system is really great, enough space to store your book or headphones, seat is comfortable, without the Z on bed position which i think is a real improvement However, the only small negative point is that the seat is a bit narrow with small arms rest during take off and landing, you can push it down during the flight so not a real issue. Aircraft is great even if i was expected a more quiet environment, compared with the A350 for example. I didn't mention the service and the food which were amazing. Overall a great way to fly."
2018-05-07,9,9,"""meal was hot and tasty""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Departed from Changi airport Terminal 3. Check in was via self serve terminals - very easy. Followed by bag drop, due to a longish queue was redirected to another baggage drop area. Ground staff were eager to assist passengers. Check-in complete a quick process through security and immigration and into a shoppers paradise. Plenty to shop for and places to grab a coffee and a bite to eat. Boarding was orderly and quick again with lots of smiles and “welcome aboard”. Earphones were picked up as we boarded pillows and blankets already on the seats. Service commenced with a hot towel service followed by a bar service. I was drinking apple juice with ice. Shortly after the meal service commenced. The flight attendant noticed my empty glass an asked if I would like another apple juice with ice but she didn’t have ice on the meal trolley would I mind waiting a couple of minutes. I didn’t mind at all. And sure enough within a couple of minutes another flight attendant brought my drink - impressive and unexpected in economy class. The meal was hot and tasty and quite substantial. The seat, although not quite as comfortable as the A330 on the outbound flight, was fine and had good recline. After the meal trays were collected we were offered ice creams. On at least two more occasions my drink was replenished without asking even while I napped. Again a comfortable flight with excellent service. Singapore Airlines has always been the bench mark for service and they are working hard to maintain the high standard they have set."
2018-05-07,8,8,"""same high standard""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. It has been a long time since I last flew SQ, I am pleased to say nothing has changed they are still the same high standard they were. Check in at Perth was fast. Boarding was by zones and very orderly and efficient, lots of happy smiles and “welcome aboard” from the cabin crew stationed throughout the aircraft. The aircraft was showing its age but was very clean and the seats were very comfortable, ample leg room (I am 6ft) and good recline. Seats were already prepared with blankets, pillows and headphones. Safety checks carried out a number of times prior to and during taxi. Shortly after take-off service commenced with hot towels followed by a very good breakfast. During this 5 hour flight the crew passed through the cabin at least 4 times with trays of water and juice. Inflight entertainment was excellent with plenty to watch and listen to.The only criticism of this flight was the cabin temperature, freezing, the blanket proved essential. That said all in all a very comfortable flight with great service."
2018-05-06,7,7,"""a nice experience""","✅ Trip Verified | It's a nice experience to take Singapore Airline A380 from Hong Kong to Singapore. The ground staff in Hong Kong is not very nice but cabin crew are friendly. I order a seafood meal and taste good, however, as A380 is the largest aircraft it takes long time to board."
2018-05-02,10,10,"""a very pleasant trip""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore return on the brand new Boeing 787-10. Check-in at both Suvarnabhumi and Changi was organized and the staff were courteous and professional. Boarding was organized by row number, with clear announcements made for each boarding group. The highlight for both flights was the cabin itself. The seat in Economy, although in the 3-3-3 configuration on the 787, was very spacious, with generous leg room and seat storage. All seat amenities, including a charging port, light switch, and crew call sign, were available on the seat back. The IFE screen was crisp and the system itself had so much quality content, including the newest movies. The system did lag slightly when exiting the navigation map. Catering and cabin crew service was consistent with that of other Asia's legacy carrier's standards. Service could have been a bit more personal, but with 301 seats in Economy for a 1.40hrs flight, the crew did an amazing job. Overall, a very pleasant trip and I look forward to flying with them whenever I can!"
2018-04-25,8,8,"""Singapore Airlines were great""",✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Auckland via Singapore. Very good flight but the seat got a little uncomfortable towards the end. Good legroom as I am a tall man and had around 3 inches to spare. Was able to have my legs straight when I wanted which makes a difference. I flew with Etihad from Auckland to Manchester and my knees rubbed the seat in front all the way. Singapore Airlines were great.
2018-04-23,7,7,"""cabin crew so attentive""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Denpasar. Old plane doesn’t mean always bad, SQ did a good job for old plane on this flight. SFML meal is good and everything’s okay during the flight, cabin crew so attentive to all passengers even the economy class passanger. SQ did a good job (again) this time!"
2018-04-23,8,8,"""it’s nice as usual""","✅ Trip Verified | Short haul flight and it’s nice as usual, everything’s fine and this is the best option for CGK-SIN flight. It’s value for money and it’s best if you compare to other airlines based on travel duration and price. SQ is one of my favourite Asian airlines u til today."
2018-04-23,6,6,"""This route not too perfect""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. This route not too perfect like long haul flight that operated by SQ. It’s full of people, but it’s not affected to the service. I suggest SQ to change the new aircraft for this route, since so many traveler from BKK airport. Food for this flight is better than flight embarked from SIN."
2018-04-23,9,9,"""Best short haul option""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Jakarta. Best short haul option for Business Trip in Jakarta. On time, quick check-in process, and well organize flight. Food is good, FA did a great job. The only minus is arrival service at CGK, crowded airport with lack service. Baggage claim need so long time!"
2018-04-20,8,8,"""crews are pleasant and proactive""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. Outgoing flight is quite ordinary. Head of the flight does not really possesses usual SQ pleasant personality. I was not addressed by name nor was shown to my seat. Menu was downgraded to one small thin piece of paper similar to economy class menu and wine/ cocktail choices are not listed. The retrofitted 777-200er business class seat is not comfortable at all. It give passenger good privacy, but for a short flight which does not require bed, I cannot find comfortable lounging position at all. Toilet are well stocked and very well taken care of. The return flight is better, same flimsy menu paper, same aircraft and same seat, but crews are pleasant and proactive. My lobster from “Book the cook” menu is very nice."
2018-04-15,8,8,"""Legroom was reasonable""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew return from Singapore to Taipei. Flights were a very reasonable hour; early morning departing and early afternoon returning. The flight out was probably only 65% occupied, which contributed to the overall sense of wellbeing. Flight was on the A330 series, with 2-4-2 configuration. If travelling as a couple or pair, taking the window/aisle seats definitely gives you a sense of your own space, so this was a big plus. Legroom was reasonable. Service was up to the usual standards, although the most senior crew were sometimes a bit unsmiling. Food was average to good, depending on your choice, and the AVOD although not spanking new, was sufficient to entertain most for this 4 hour flight. The airplane is probably beginning to show it's age - it was a bit creaky and rattly on takeoff and landing, but everything is well maintained and perfectly comfortable. Singapore Air may transition some flights to the Boeing 787, and many suggest the 3-3-3 economy seating is a nightmare for economy travellers."
2018-04-10,9,9,"""would recommend the product""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Tokyo Haneda and Tokyo Narita to Singapore. A350 on the way there, 777-300ER on the way back to Singapore. Latest business class product on both segments. Seat is large and very good – plenty of privacy, storage options and reading lights. There is only one con: space for legs/feet is very limited when seat is fully down, which is kind of annoying. Mattress is also not the softest. Blanket and pillows provided are of very high quality. No amenity kit provided. Personal TV has a big high-resolution screen with a broad selection of movies and channels to keep you busy. Service was really good, proactive and with a smile – that’s where Singapore Airlines shines the most in my opinion. Room for improvement is the food. Meals selection is quite good (including the Book the Cook option) but the meal quality is inferior to other airlines in Business (see Turkish Airlines or Qatar). Good champagne and extensive selection of beverages available upon request. Note of merit for the chamomile served along with pastries & chocolates selection. First flight on-time. Return flight delayed of 40 minutes due to the delayed incoming aircraft on the Los Angeles – Tokyo Narita segment. Overall, would recommend the product and will fly again."
2018-04-05,2,2,"""at best a poor outcome from SQ""","✅ Trip Verified | As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didn't have the gf option for her."
2018-04-01,7,7,"""enjoyed the overall experience""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore. Both myself and my wife enjoyed the overall experience, responsive flight attendants and very friendly. Our only real complaint is the food which we found to be rather unappetising and repetitive, perhaps a few European or English dishes would be a refreshing change and certainly more welcoming to our palate."
2018-03-31,9,9,"""Service remains 5-star""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Singapore return in seat 41B (seat with more space against extra fee). Service remains 5-star, food, onboard service and entertainment, boarding. Have flown several times on this airline in the past in economy class. Boarding on both flights were swift and smooth with clear instructions from airline staff. Choice of food adequate with sandwiches/refreshment available outside of main meal distribution. On the return leg, the breakfast offering was adequate but not available due to short supply on board. I was forced to take noodles as breakfast while preference was for other dish. Boeing 777 seats are of good quality, only drawback is that seat cushion is quite short for a tall person with long legs and the screen is slightly far away from the seat. Movie offering is very extended with quite some recent movies in different languages. (A380 is more comfortable). Seats 41A & B are best, avoid 41C which passenger was hit all the time by transiting galleys As usual Changi airport is fabulous airport even with a transit time of 4 hours with next connection: gardens, swimming pool, butterfly and movie area is unique, European airports should learn and copy."
2018-03-28,3,3,"""never came with a drink""",✅ Trip Verified | Aircraft was very outdated. Inflight entertainment audio was out of sync with the screen. I order a diabetic meal and the meals I was due on this flight never came with a drink until the main service was undertaken. The last meal I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee; I replied water and it never arrived. Others were at least 40 minutes after I had finished my meal.
2018-03-27,10,10,"""easily the best""",✅ Trip Verified | Service and airline were excellent. I’ve flown with most international airlines and Singapore Airlines is easily the best. They looked after us during the entire flight. Easy check in process etc. Flew London to Singapore to Melbourne in economy class.
2018-03-26,10,10,"""seats were really comfortable""",✅ Trip Verified | Another great flight from Singapore to London. Me and my wife were sat in the upper economy deck which was great! The seats were really comfortable and the service was just as good as my last trip. The food was really good and a great selection of films. I’m so glad I’ve booked with Singapore Airlines for my next long haul trip.
2018-03-23,4,4,"""breakfast was served very late""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. The seats in business class are awkward, to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle, and because of this it feels cramped. We left Sydney at 7.05 in the evening, and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm, there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. The flight to Singapore takes 7.15 hrs, there was a 1 hour change over of planes. After take off we were offered dinner again, which having already had an evening meal I passed. The flight to London from Singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. Breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. It was served very late. I think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 22-23 hrs, and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. We will not be travelling Singapore airlines again."
2018-03-22,5,5,"""economy class has declined""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have been flying Singapore Airlines for the past thirty years. I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years. Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class. However, it is very hard for me to justify spending an additional $1000 just to get two upgraded meals and a slightly larger TV screen."
2018-03-19,2,2,"""experience no better than average""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore. The flight attendants are some of the nit-pickiest I've ever seen. My crime was sleeping during the pre-flight video. The experience was no better than average. The food wasn't special, the premium economy seat was a premium economy seat. It got worse on the way back when we stopped at the Star Gold lounge to discover what is the worse Gold lounge I've ever been to. It felt more like a private waiting area than a lounge, it doesn't even have its own bathrooms. Singapore is doing the bare minimum to provide the benefits as part of Star Alliance. Lufthansa gained a star - maybe Singapore needs to lose one."
2018-03-16,10,10,"""very courteous and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Bandar Seri Begawan. As usual, excellent service onboard. Very professional service crew and very courteous and helpful. Saw many of them helping passengers with their requests such as blankets, baggage, newspapers. The food is also good and sufficient. The choice of movies were great though I wished the plane was equipped with the newer wider screens."
2018-03-15,9,9,"""staff were friendly and professional""","✅ Trip Verified | First time flying on the A350 and it makes the flight from Munich to Singapore considerably more comfortable than on the 777. As usual Singapore Airlines staff were friendly and professional, as we were traveling with a toddler, we were invited to board first and get ourselves settled. Stewardess came by to check if we needed anything for our daughter and if we would like our meals at different times. Seats were comfortable, row 41, which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight, I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly."
2018-03-14,9,9,"""Neat, clean and comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Shanghai via Singapore. I always travel business class (though first time on SIA fleet) and conclude that Singapore Airlines is the best. The aircraft are up to date and so are the facilities. Neat, clean and comfortable. But, it is the staff that take the airline to the next level - courteous, friendly, helpful and efficient especially the cabin crew on flights SQ 479, JHB to Singapore, 10 Feb and SQ 478, Shanghai to Singapore, 28 Feb 2018."
2018-03-07,7,7,"""super comfortable and very wide""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore leg flown on Boeing 777 with outdated cabin. Seat was hard and thin, food of average quality. Cabin staff spoke quietly. Return flight was on a Boeing 777 with newer cabin. Seats were excellent, they fold down from the back so the bed is on the back of the seat. A bit of fussing around to set it up but super comfortable and very wide. But it needs to be wide as someone 181cm tall still needs to lie on an angle, as the foot cubby-hole is not in line with the seat centre-line."
2018-03-06,10,10,"""staff are actually genuinely friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew London Heathrow to Singapore. First time I have flown with Singapore Airlines and it was an eye opener. The staff are actually genuinely friendly and the service and products are excellent. Lots of legroom, great entertainment and really good food and drinks. During the flight they kept coming round with more drinks and more food offerings. Great flight and will fly with them again."
2018-03-05,8,8,"""My favourite as always""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Jakarta. Another short haul and nothing to complain about services and foods. It meets a standard of 5 star airlines (whether the aircraft is old), combining a with very nice airport at Changi. My favourite as always, nice job Singapore Airlines."
2018-03-03,8,8,"""crew greeted the passengers with a smile""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Perth to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Check in was quick and smooth. The boarding was orderly and the crew greeted the passengers with a smile. Found a pillow and blanket on my seat. The seat and leg room was average. No footrests but liked the flexible adjustable headrests. Flight left only a few minutes late from the scheduled take off. Shortly after take off the crew came out with hot towels, snacks, drinks and food menu. There were enough alcoholic drinks to choose from. I got myself a Tiger beer but I had to ask for second beer, would have preferred if the crew had offered. Food was fresh and tasted great, didn't taste like airline food at all. There was salmon with coleslaw, crackers and cheese, bread roll and butter along with 2 choices of main course. My Asian beef curry was delicious. For dessert we had fresh fruit salad and gelato. The best meal I have had on a flight and this was all in economy class. The let down was the IFE. The screens were small and had poor resolution, no touchscreen either. The headphone jack was fiddly, I was using my personal headphones but occasionally I would lose sound in either left or right channel. I watched Dunkirk (2017), which was good. On arrival the luggage arrived quickly and without any damage. Overall a good flight but was disappointed with IFE. The ticket was also expensive compared with other airlines."
2018-03-02,1,1,"""they have earned my lowest rating""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Singapore. My wife and I were planning a vacation to SE Asia, so I bought round-trip tickets between San Francisco and Singapore on the Singapore Airlines web site. The next day I was looking for tickets to Siem Reap for a side trip to Angkor Wat when I discovered on Travelocity that Silk Air had the best flights, and that Silk Air was a part of Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines website did not make this clear at all. So I called Singapore Airlines to add these Silk Air flights to my booking. Imagine my surprise and disbelief when I was told I had to pay a $500 penalty because this ‘change’ came two hours after their 24 hour change deadline. I talked to two of their supervisors, but they also insisted on this penalty. It did not matter that Silk Air was hidden deep within Singapore Airlines website. It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour ‘deadline’ Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty. Just booking the Silk Air flights separately would have cost me an extra $690. In a situation that clearly called for a little flexibility and compromise Singapore Airlines showed none. For that reason they have earned my lowest rating."
2018-03-02,8,8,"""As always they’re really good""",✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to Singapore. This time I took an economy class since the flight was short haul. As always they’re really good from ground handling until services during the flight. Nothing to say again about this airline since I only choose them and SilkAir for Southeast Asia’s destination.
2018-03-02,8,8,"""definitely choose SIA again""",✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. It’s still good and worthy for 45mins flight. They couldn’t serve meal but it’s acceptable since the flight is very short and the drink was quite good and definitely choose SIA again and there’s no regret at all for this very short trip. Thanks SIA.
2018-03-01,8,8,"""always know how to treat a loyal customer""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Jakarta to Singapore. Good short haul with free airport lounge access in CGK. Everything’s good and no regrets at all. Good Ground Services and nice Flight Attendant. For me it’s a real 5 star airline for Southeast Asia. SIA always know how to treat a loyal customer, love it!"
2018-02-27,10,10,"""how business class should be done""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Brisbane. A great example of how business class should be done. Practically a brand new aircraft which features the latest Singapore business seats. The 1-2-1 configuration is perfect for privacy and easy aisle access. In my opinion, the hard product that Singapore offers, as well as the crew is what makes them stand out from the rest. The seat and entertainment system are great - and the seat converts to a reasonably comfortable bed. For a bit of extra room, I'd recommend the first row (Row 11) of business as there is a bit more leg space. Food was good and as I had ordered book the cook, my choice was already taken care of and served promptly after takeoff. Wine selection was good and my glass was never empty. The A350 features inflight wifi and Singapore now offers 30Mb for free to business class passengers which worked well for me and provided just enough to check emails a few times during the flight. The standout was the exceptional level of service provided by the crew. Business class was fairly empty (only 10 seats occupied on this flight), but as it was an overnight flight, it would have been very easy for the crew to disappear. However, the service was constant without being ""in your face."" A great experience with Singapore, and the A350 certainly makes travel very pleasant."
2018-02-26,1,1,"""they should have upgraded me""",✅ Trip Verified | Coimbatore to Melbourne via Singapore. I travelled with my 16 month old baby and SIA did not offer me a bassinet seat although I had requested for it before hand. They said that they have children younger than mine who needed it. I understand that but they should have offered me a spare seat or upgraded me to business class. I had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne with not enough leg room. On top of it the cabin crew didn't bother to provide any food for the baby. They didn't offer me an infant seat belt (I had to insist on one). Singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. I have been flying Singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.
2018-02-26,7,7,"""Hope it improves on the return""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Auckland. Disappointed firstly we were only given one glass of champagne, not duplicates as advertised. Secondly we chose meals via Book the Chef and we had finished our meals before we were offered wine and then only a small glass supplied. We were offered no snacks and the curtain was drawn very quickly and passengers were quickly sent to the rear of the aircraft if they entered the curtain wall. This was in complete contrast to the flight from London to Singapore which was superb. We were offered champagne top up and crew could not be more helpful. Hope it improves on the return!"
2018-02-23,8,8,"""crew were extremely attentive""","✅ Trip Verified | A380 from Singapore to Sydney. Aircraft was up to standard and leg room was adequate. Dinner was acceptable , breakfast was a let down as a muffin can hardly pass as a continental breakfast as the menu suggested. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who were extremely attentive and efficient right throughout."
2018-02-22,8,8,"""a pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Singapore with the A380-800 was a pleasant experience. Aircraft is fully equipped with the right entertainment and facilities for a long haul flight. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who did an efficient and friendly job managing the cabin. The catering however, was a major let down as there was no International option and the breakfast was merely a muffin, which is a pathetic excuse for what is marketed as a ‘continental breakfast’. Ground staff at both ends were remarkable."
2018-02-20,9,9,"""Cabin crew very attentive""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew the 1250 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow. Push back on time but queuing on the taxiway for take off for another 25 mins before take off. The economy cabin was probably 60% full so we had 3 seats between the two of us. A few lucky travellers had 3 seats each so could get some reasonably comfortable sleep. The plane was clean. The set back TVs in excellent condition. The cabin temperature was just right too. Cabin crew very attentive and regularly came through the cabin with juices or water. The two meals were tasty as were the mid flight snacks of meat rolls, crisps and chocolate. As ecomony goes this has got to be one of the best offerings for long haul. However I would say that when the seat in front is reclined it is very intrusive into your personal space and makes watching your own TV screen uncomfortable. The only answers then for you too to recline your seat. If only everyone would just keep their seats upright! The outbound trip 3 weeks earlier was equally as comfortable. 5 stars all round!"
2018-02-13,9,9,"""crew were very attentive""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Bangkok via Singapore. I dont know why Singapore Airlines chose a seat which needs a crew member to set it up before sleeping. If you want to recline the crew member again has to disable the sleep position. Sleeping at a angular position is not comfortable. Apart from this the crew were very attentive, caring and the quality of AVML was very good."
2018-02-11,7,7,"""surprised to discover how far SQ is behind""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore in January. It's been 10 years since I flew Singapore Airlines and boy they've gone downhill since. Cabin service on both legs was really indifferent, especially on my evening flight back from Jakarta. Flown on many other airlines before but none except SQ offered me just ""coffee and tea"" during the meal service. Had to wait for another cabin attendant to pass by before I could get anything other than a hot drink. To a more discerning traveller it suggests cost cutting which is not cool. Inflight entertainment was mixed. Flight to Jakarta had one of the newest systems on the A350 but back home I was surprised to discover how far SQ is behind. No touch screen for the A330s in economy! Ground service was also a mixed bag - good in Singapore but underwhelming in Jakarta where my flight was delayed for almost an hour. No announcement and no apology until we we were all aboard. Can't fault their catering, which to my surprise was very good. Also, SQ android app is probably one of the best I've used and had no problem checking in for my flight on a phone. But my final verdict is that while SQ is not awful it's not that great or special either. Needs to improve a lot to catch up with airlines such as EVA and Turkish which I think are among the best these days."
2018-02-11,7,7,"""a nice airline but a lot of hype""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita with Singapore Airlines. Pleasant Crew, food OK. Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok, seats great because it’s still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that it’s a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool. Also like other rules I’ve never experienced before with competing carries. I was told that because I was at the bulkhead, if there was turbulence I’d have to restore my back. I thought that’s no going to happen. So all in all a nice airline but a lot of hype."
2018-01-31,5,5,"""service was very rushed""","✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Houston. Some hostesses were very brusque and at odds to the image this company likes to portray. On the return trip in particular, the cabin was only 1/4 full and the service was very rushed. There should be no reason for this on a 8.5 hour flight with a full complement of staff. There were a few ambitious types who tried to look like they were in charge of the others but I guess you get that sort everywhere. No individual air vents."
2018-01-29,5,5,"""decline in passenger facilities""",✅ Trip Verified | Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.
2018-01-27,5,5,"""seat is not comfortable """,✅ Trip Verified | Guangzhou to Singapore with A330 aircraft. The timing of flight SQ851 is good for the people departing from Guangzhou and arrive in Singapore. The cabin crew are nice and some of them even could speak Cantonese. But due to an old aircraft the seat is not comfortable and the inflight entertainment system is no work for my seat.
2018-01-27,4,4,"""seat is not comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Guangzhou. The boarding gate in Terminal 3 A20, so far away. Cabin crew are nice and one of them is from Chinese. They offered supper and several types of drinks including welcome drink. But the aircraft is old and the seat is not comfortable, the ear phone is not work even I change for 3 times."
2018-01-26,5,5,"""we were not very impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Tokyo Narita. Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class. Singapore Airlines have always been expected to be premium (along the lines with ANA/Qatar/Emirates). For the amount of money spent, I would very much go for ANA."
2018-01-24,3,3,"""The meals were very Asian""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other’s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess’s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn’t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ’s “book the cook” option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn’t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn’t great. I wasn’t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I can’t recommend SQ and probably won’t chose to fly with them again."
2018-01-23,3,3,"""could’ve done better to handle special requests""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 5'3 female. Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic “western style” of whatever meal selection chosen. I would’ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew could’ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. I’m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. Be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs."
2018-01-18,10,10,"""I can recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. Excellent service, all flights on time, leg space much better than some airlines. Very friendly cabin crew, good choice of meals, planes clean. I can recommend."
2018-01-12,9,9,"""flight attendants very kind""","✅ Trip Verified | We traveled in Premium Economy on the Rome to Singapore route, our judgment is very good, more space and the recline higher than the classic Economy, I managed to sleep which I usually can never do in flight. Wine given for the flight and a small Amenity kit containing a toothbrush and socks with a clutch. The flight attendants were very kind, during the flight snacks, drinks and food are constantly served. The onboard entertainment is complete with films in Italian and many TV series, documentaries and music to choose from, in the Premium class you have a 'Priority' service from the baggage to the boarding."
2018-01-10,1,1,"""Terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines from Perth to Singapore. Terrible customer service and substandard conditions. Seat was ""wet"" departing Perth. Notified flight attendant and sat on blanket. Five hours later on descent, senior flight attendant came and said, ""sorry about that"". Attitude was indifferent and no effort was made to recover the situation. They're supposed to be known for their excellent customer service, it went missing!"
2018-01-10,9,9,"""service standards are stellar""","✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Singapore. Smooth check in at New Delhi airport where they do also weigh your hand carry; something I did not see at Changi. Boarding procedures were seamless. The dated seat on the 772 was quite comfortable although there was no USB port to charge smartphones. Beautiful celebratory wreaths decorated the cabin walls. Singapore Airlines give big, fluffy pillows and blankets in economy class. You can select newspapers and headphones while boarding. Hot towels and menus were served. Singapore Airlines service standards are stellar. IFE on board differed on the 777 and A380. Screens unfortunately were not that clear or clean on both aircraft. The vegetarian oriental meals I ordered on both flights were super. Crew provide refreshments and the cabin presence on board was beyond any other airline in economy class I have flown."
2018-01-05,10,10,"""whole experience is definitely recommendable""","First class from Singapore to Narita with Singapore Airlines. An old plane (compared to the ones advertised recently) huge seat. Very personalised service from check in to the plane. Pyjamas offered on board, even for this relatively short (around 6 hours flight). Book the cook service offered an amazing selection of food, however I chose the inflight menu with the Japanese selection. It was fantastic for a supper menu! The bed is made by collapsing the back of the seat and is quite comfortable. Inflight entertainment was a bit tough (the remote was quite old). There was inflight wifi however I didn't use it. The whole experience is definitely recommendable."
2018-01-05,8,8,"""airline had the old cabin product""","✅ Trip Verified | Business class from Haneda to Singapore. The airline had the old cabin product, and it really shows. The panel which supposed to cover the compartment to store smaller items near the screen was missing, and the steward explained that only the engineering people can fix this. The seat was wide, however the awkward shape of the leg area makes it very hard to be comfortable, as we had to sleep diagonally (the new cabin product as we see online removed this problem). First class seats did not have this issue. Sleeper service (our flight departed at 10.50 pm) means that supper was only two course (instead of the three courses with Satay) - which was main meal and a bowl of fruit. Inflight entertainment offered the latest movies, however the screen was quite old and we noticed some scratches on the screen. Service was exceptional trademark of Singapore Airlines. I would recommend this airline despite the old product still."
2018-01-04,9,9,"""thank the crew of this flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to San Francisco. I just wish to thank the crew of this flight. Their attentiveness to passengers were impressive especially the attendant looking after my area (seat # 50s). I sat on the aisle side of a middle row seats. The person sitting next to me, in the middle seat, inquired for an aisle seat and was informed of this availability just a few rows back. He probably didn't act fast enough, somehow he stayed put. I didn't feel like eating & kept the dessert (amazingly the attendant noticed, asked if the food didn't meet my standard and if she could offer me something else. Wow! What airline does this!). I decided to sleep through the long flight. Feeling cold, I tucked myself in with blankets. The middle seat person apparently had to exit his seat numerous times. Instead of exiting from his right, where a gentleman was seated,who was not sleeping, was not working, was not tucked in, nor was he sleeping, he decided to pass through my seat. Each time, I had to re-tucked myself in. At one point, he dropped my dessert and spilled my left over white wine over me. Again the crew came to action, even brought her personal parfum spritzer so as to alleviate the wine smell on me. Singapore Airlines, I know you have a great team but the one looking after my area outdid everyone else on flight SQ31 from Singapore to SFO. Thank you!"
2018-01-04,9,9,"""being a premium airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore. This sector was the second sector of my flight back from Vienna, the VIE-BKK sector being on Austrian Airlines. As a short 2-hour regional flight, SQ still lives up to its reputation of being a premium airline. Shortly after take-off, dinner service commenced with a choice of 2 main courses. Being a short flight, menu cards were not distributed to passengers. Instead, flight attendants showed passengers a menu card with photos of the main courses and descriptions of the meal. I had the chicken casserole with penne pasta. Drinks and coffee or tea were served at the same time. As it was a short flight, I did not watch any movies on the IFE. One difference that I noticed was that earphones distributed were of the in-ear type instead of the over-ear type typically used by SQ. Perhaps in a move to save costs, headphones in economy are no longer of the over-ear type? I can’t confirm this as it has been some years since I have flown SQ economy."
2018-01-01,10,10,"""the experience was good""","✅ Trip Verified | Surabaya to Singapore, check in was fast. Service started with a hot towel before departure. We took off on time and for the meal I chose chicken. I watched the IFE which had a lot of options. All in all the experience was good."
2017-12-31,10,10,"""thank all the involved people""","✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Zürich via Singapore. This was our first trip with our baby girl (6 months old). Sadly, as we landed in Singapore from Kuala Lumpur for Transit to Zurich, our baby had high fever. After checking in the clinic at T3 of Changi Airport, it was clear we couldn't continue our route. Instead, our baby had to go to a Hospital in Singapore. Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn't say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry. We like to thank all the involved people from SIA and Changi Airport - you helped us when we needed it the most. Once our baby was healthy again and could be discharged, SIA helped us with our luggage and checkin in, making sure it all goes smooth. We had our bassinet seat, the flight in the A380 was good as can be with a baby. Onboard staff was attentive and supportive, food was OK."
2017-12-31,10,10,"""dinner service was good""","✅ Trip Verified | Surabaya to Melbourne via Singapore. I arrived at Surabaya airport T2 a little bit early and luckily the check in counter was open, the check in experience was fast and smooth, and I was granted a window seat. We boarded the A330-300 on time and took off on time. Lunch service started and I was amazed how they serve a hot meal on a 2 hour flight. This time the options were lasagna or chicken with rice, I chose the chicken with rice and it was amazing. Most cabin crew could speak Bahasa. 6 days later I arrived at Singapore Changi T3 very early, the check was all automatic even the baggage drop. Singapore Changi is one of my favourite airports so waiting for 5 hours wasn't a problem, to kill some time we went to the butterfly garden and after that the cinema which was playing some pretty good movies. I got a window seat on this flight. We took off on time and dinner service was good. I started to watch the IFE, had a good sleep after that and woke up for breakfast. I highly recommend flying Singapore Airlines."
2017-12-30,10,10,"""gracious crew go the extra mile""","✅ Trip Verified | Brisbane to London via Singapore. The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant. The crew kept the cabin spotless, regularly removing rubbish and cleaning the toilets. They also kept a close eye on the cabin at night, regularly offering drinks and snacks to those awake without having to be asked. The gracious crew go the extra mile to make a long journey special. Having flown this journey with most carriers, I will be a loyal Singapore Airlines customer."
2017-12-29,1,1,"""give a wide berth""",✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore. Absolute disgrace. Randomly selected seats for my family all over the aircraft. Last flew with this airline a couple of years ago and it was brilliant. It seems poor now. Entertainment onboard was busted. I travel regularly and would seriously say that even a budget airline is better than Singapore Airlines. Do yourself a favour and give this airline a wide berth.
2017-12-24,9,9,"""couldn't fault the flights at all""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. First time I've flown with this airline since 1991, and I couldn't fault the flights at all. I'm reasonably tall (5'8"") with long legs, but I had plenty of seat room. Service was exemplary, and I liked the extra touches of menus and the little convenience bag, containing socks, toothpaste and toothbrush, and an eyeshade. Food was pretty good, and the entertainment choices excellent. Despite a tight connection in Singapore (50 minutes) I still had plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again."
2017-12-23,2,2,"""all our bags have gone missing""","✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Sydney via Singapore. The first leg from Delhi was with Jet Airways (to be followed by the Sydney leg with Qantas). The Jet Airways flight was half an hour late and it was obviously decided before we landed that we would not be allowed to board the ongoing leg, as we were collected and ushered to get new boarding passes for a much later flight. We were then offered a flight only 3.5 hours later with Singapore Airlines and the staff at Singapore Airport completed all the documentation, including the transferring of our bags. But all our bags have gone missing and did not turn up in Sydney. I realise that they are still in ""tracking"" mode, however we are desperate to get them back before Christmas. We have tried all day calling Singapore Airlines, but they do not answer."
2017-12-21,8,8,"""Overall, it was a good flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bangkok return. Staff are friendly and helpful. However on this flight, service seems rushed. It felt that they were rushing to complete many tasks. Although it didn't affect me, their stress didn't give me a very relaxed feel. Knowing that this a short flight, I can understand why they were rushing to complete tasks. If they can mask that stress, that will be perfect. This was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was a bit dated. It didn't bother me much as I had my own book to keep me occupied on the journey. Overall, it was a good flight."
2017-12-18,4,4,"""expecting so much more""",✅ Trip Verified | London to Perth via Singapore. I was expecting so much more. Not just the reviews but the additional cost of premium. The first leg to Singapore was poor. The air crew are fully engaged with economy and consequently are not seen. The second leg was so much better due to the air crews attitude and attention. Ironically the second leg was economy. Certainly on the first leg premium on the 777-300 I do not feel the seat justifies the significant increase in cost. The majority of passengers around me had been upgraded from economy. The economy seat on the second leg near the exit was just as comfortable so unless you are flying business I would suggest econony seat near the exit. Maybe the A380 is better premium but not the 777-300
2017-12-18,1,1,"""not fly with them in future""",✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to New Delhi via Singapore. The food (IVML) served on my flight from Sydney to Singapore was horrible. I complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. The food on Singapore to Delhi flight was also below average. I previously always had an above average experience with SIA but looks like they are cutting costs. I pay a premium to fly with SIA and expect services of acceptable standards. Will not fly with them in future.

2017-12-18,9,9,"""a pleasant flight experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Hong Kong. The cabin crew in general was warm, and tended to our needs promptly throughout the flight. However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his. However, the service from the flight attendants was outstanding-no surprises as to why SQ can consistently rank as one of the top airlines. On the return flight, the equipment was the same; however, the aircraft came in late, and departure was delayed by 15 minutes! On top of that, after boarding we could not push back due to ""traffic congestion"" and ended up taking off 1 hour behind schedule! Hardware wise, still the same experience as the outbound flight; however, the cabin crew was just as warm, polite and made us feel welcomed on board and attended to our every need promptly-again, top marks for that. All in all, a pleasant flight experience with Singapore Airlines and given the price, would definitely choose them again"

Each passenger received a small bag of useful travel items as a gift."
2017-11-26,10,10,"""excellent customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. We arrived at Melbourne Airport 1 hour early not expecting the check-in to be open, the check-in counter was open and had no line. I requested a window seat and was lucky to get one in the front cabin, we were also told our flight might be full. We boarded the A380 with nice welcoming smile. Our seat had a blanket, pillow, IFE, coat hook and USB, we took off on time and once we were in the air, we were handed out the amenities kit which included socks, eye-mask and toothbrush. Food service started and the options were Turkey or Chicken sandwich, the man next to me did not want to eat but the crew insisted, I chose the Turkey sandwich and, it was amazing, my drink choice was coke, then I fell asleep. I woke up just in time for breakfast and the options were rice vermicelli or omelette. I chose the rice vermicelli which was OK, I had orange juice for my drink. We had a smooth landing in Singapore Changi T2 and had 30 minutes before boarding the flight to Jakarta. We just made our flight and I was given a window seat, I asked for a glass of water because I had run across the terminal and staff happily said yes and gave it to me with an ice cube, great start. We took off on time and the lunch service started straight away, I chose Nasi Goreng instead of omelette, the fried rice was the best plane food I had ever eaten, I had apple juice as my drink. Excellent customer service."
2017-11-25,9,9,"""the seating is very generous""","✅ Trip Verified | You can hardly beat the master and Singapore Airlines is one big master. First, the crew are professional, very kind and helpful. Secondly, the seating is very generous in terms of comfort and space. The business class on a Airbus 350 could compete with some first classes on other airlines or older airplanes. The entertainment on board is up to date and there is plenty of choice for those who can not sleep during long flights. Food is excellent, staff are nice. It's worth it."
2017-11-20,1,1,"""Worst flight ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to San Francisco via Hong Kong. Worst flight ever. I paid for an extra legroom seat 41c. This seat is supposedly bulkhead but it isn't. This is an isle seat which has the isle for the cabin directly in front of it. This means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. In fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. You can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. The crew just grinned each time I was jarred awake. Only once did they say sorry. I complained and the airline said sorry it hasn't been an issue before. Most airline these days have a good movie selection, not this one. Food was awful. Glad we had our own water as they hardly bring any around. I know this is a long flight but the crew were terrible."
2017-11-20,10,10,"""a high level of inflight service""","✅ Trip Verified | I was seated in the front row of Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines A380 service from Auckland to Singapore. Being the first row, it has extra leg space. The PE seat is upholstered in leather and had a good recline. AC socket, USB port were available in each seat. For each of the two meals served on this route, there was a choice of 3 main courses on the menu. During the 10 hour flight, flight attendants came around often to offer drinks at regular intervals. In between meals, there was a snack service with a choice of fruits, sandwiches and chips. The selection of movies and music for inflight entertainment is extensive and probably one of the best if not the best. Noise cancelling headphones are provided for best acoustic effect. As always, Singapore Airlines maintains a high level of inflight service and this flight is no different."
2017-11-14,10,10,"""I found the flight excellent""",✅ Verified Review | Houston to Kuala Lumpur via Manchester and Singapore. I found the flight excellent. One problem which was outside Singapore Airlines' control was we had to have a security check at Manchester which took for ages. I will fly Singapore airlines whenever I have a chance.
2017-11-13,9,9,"""a very positive experience""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Hong Kong return via Singapore. 3 x A380, 1 x Boeing 777-300. Lower deck on the first flight with a spare seat next to me so very comfortable. The 777 was a full flight but a short one so not a problem. HKG to SIN upper deck 2 seats comfortable. SIN to LHR we were moved from downstairs to 2 seats at the very back. Upstairs is quieter but it was very cold requiring two blankets. The meals were mostly not to my taste as they were spicy but the wonderful cabin crew tried their best to find me an alternative. They even found me a dessert that was not ice-cream for which I was very grateful. Regular drinks rounds and snacks on offer. The toilets were kept clean. The soft furnishings are starting to look shabby and I don't see the point of the footrests but those are the only negatives. Four safe flights and luggage arrived too so a very positive experience."
2017-11-12,9,9,"""special meal was delicious""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Zurich in May 2014 at 01.20am. Not really the time to everybody embarking a plane. Even though cabin crew is professional and friendly with a smile. This time we got a seat near the lavatories, it was surprisingly quiet. My online preordered special meal was delicious. The inflight entertainment needed an urgent upgrade in 2014. Even the flightpath has seen its better years."
2017-11-12,10,10,"""all three seats were free""","✅ Verified Review | Zürich to Singapore in March 2013. As I do my booking pretty early I'm often able to reserve a seat in the wing area. So that's 40+. Therefore I board the plane late to avoid queuing. To my surprise all three seats were free and it remained like this. As I ordered previously my special meal online, I got it before actual service starts. This time a tenderloin absolutely tasty. Cabin crew as usual very aware, they're able to read your wishes from the eyes. Even a small talk is possible."
2017-11-12,10,10,"""there is a lot of legroom""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Zurich in May 2013. In April, to my knowledge, SQ 346 is very often packed and seat reservation might be difficult if you are two but on a different booking. On this particular flight I took a so called P seat which is next to the exit. Actually there is a lot of legroom left on the other side of the metal, there's permanently cold air coming up from the door. As often for a early morning flight 01.20am people are some of harshly due to sleep shortness. The cabin crew is very patient even if some become aggressive sometimes."
2017-11-11,9,9,"""all is done with a smile""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore to Bangkok. The flight SQ970 departing 07.15h is during weekdays always very busy as business people are traveling for a one day business trip to Bangkok. Obviously many are not able to book a business class seat due to limited availability. The cabin crew therefore during boarding were busy with those people handing over their jackets and luggage into a safe storage. Even here, all is done with a smile on and on. It is a short flight but I still feel the comfort and great hospitality of Singapore Airlines."
2017-11-11,3,3,"""disappointed with quality of service""",✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Singapore. I am disappointed with quality of service and staff attitude on my last flight SQ 252 on 10 November. I requested for a non vegetarian Hindu meal and was served Lamb. For some reason I don't understand my meal was served before other passengers and when I asked for another meal I was rudely told that it can only be served once all Passengers are served. I left extremely insulted and did not eat any meal on flight.
2017-11-11,9,9,"""very polite cabin crew""",✅ Verified Review | Zürich to Bangkok via Singapore. As usual very polite cabin crew. I became sick during the flight. They did everything possible to make my flight as comfortable as possible. I was asking/ordering on internet for special meal. Therefore I was served right at the beginning of menu supply. Food was as always very tasty.
2017-11-09,2,2,"""an hour to check the bags in""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Colombo in July 2017. The ground staff were quite rude and to wait at least an hour to check the bags in. The flight crew was also not the best and I found the food quite disappointing. Taking this airline because not many other airlines are having journeys to Colombo.
2017-11-07,1,1,"""Thumbs down to Singapore Airlines""","✅ Verified Review | Customer service fail. My wife and I had a booking for March 2018 to fly Canberra Australia to Wellington New Zealand, one way. This relates to customer service pre-flight, not comfort or service on a flight. Booking was no problem and great price. Our dates were not flexible due to other commitments. We received notification that our flight was cancelled (by the airline) and we had the option to accept an alternative (suggested flights nominated) or decline. Choosing decline gave a direction to call their help line. Called the number and despite stating our case several times that as there was no suitable alternative we would request refund we kept being offered alternative dates. Finally our request was understood (we were dealing with a human) and we were told that the operator did not have authority to action that request and our request would be forwarded to another area who would get back to us ""soon"". When asked for a timeframe we couldn't be given one. Now, I would expect that as this was the airline making the change, and, knowing that choosing decline would generate calls to the help line, a professional outfit would have provided that option for operators to action. But, no. It took a follow up email and then a second phone call to finally be advised that our request to cancel was actioned. When asked when we could expect a refund in our account we are told up to four weeks!! And, no advice of the amount to be actually refund, we have to wait for it to turn up before we can be sure full refund. Not good enough, and not what I would have expected from a full service airline that apparently prides itself on customer service. Thumbs down to Singapore Airlines."
2017-11-04,9,9,"""cabin crew were excellent as always""","✅ Verified Review | SQ 217 - Another smooth red eye flight on a fully loaded Airbus 380 flying from Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. Not sure whether there was a late night supper or not, because I took a nap as soon as we took off. Oh I should add, a very seamless boarding process, the gate was packed and I had feared for the worst but the ground staff promptly handled the process. The cabin crew were excellent as always. IFE was superb, passengers collected the headphones before entering the plane. They were of nice quality."
2017-11-04,8,8,"""very prompt and professional""","✅ Verified Review | SQ 237 - A very smooth red eye flight to Melbourne from Jakarta via Singapore. As soon as we departed Changi just before midnight, a late night snack was served but I skipped it and took a nap instead. I had a good four hour flight and woke up over the Northern Territory area to enjoy the inflight entertainment. The IFE selection was superb, very wide screen for economy class standard, plenty of choices on movies and TV shows and the quality of the headsets were decent. The flight attendants were very prompt and professional, I asked for several glasses of mineral water during coffee round, she took down the number of my seat and minutes later she returned with my request. Hot Breakfast was served before landing, I had some stir-fry noodles which looked unappetizing but tasted great. Unlike Qatar or Garuda, no basic amenities (eye shades, socks) were given. I would've given higher mark had they given us amenities pack."
2017-11-02,10,10,"""I recommend SIA""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Bangkok. Aircraft was in perfect condition and clean despite one lavatory being unserviceable. Both ground and cabin staff were coordinated both boarding and arrival was Done in a smooth flow. The food was perfectly prepared and was the best economy meal I had. I recommend SIA and hope to fly with them again soon.
2017-11-01,9,9,"""food was delicious""","✅ Verified Review | This is my second time flying with Singapore Airlines. It was such a great experience. At first I was a bit concerned because the layover was only an hour; I was afraid there would be any kind of delay that would potentially made me miss my connecting flight, but the flight was very punctual and we even arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin was clean with 3-3-3 arrangement, the legroom was spacious, the food was delicious, I really enjoyed having ice cream as dessert. The FAs were friendly and corteous. The only downside of the flight was the inflight entertainment system; the content was good enough with plenty of new movies but the hardware really fell behind. The screen was not a touchscreen, it was small, blurry and pixelated. I suggest other travelers to bring their own headphones like I did because the earphones were not comfortable. Over all it was a great flight and I would fly with them again"
2017-10-30,10,10,"""business class is second to none""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Christchurch. Singapore Airlines business class is second to none. The moment you enter the aircraft, you are greeted by name and the flight attendant takes your drink and dinner orders. I chose the Lobster Thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Business class is a fine dining experience by itself. You feel that you are being pampered by the very friendly and polite flight attendants. The seat converts to a full flat bed where you can have a good sleep. Instead of pressing a button, you have to flip over the seat back to convert it to bed mode but the good thing is that the bed is wider than other business class seats which deploy using a button. You have to sleep diagonally with your body angled such that your legs fit into the cubby hole under the seat in front. Overall, it was a wonderful experience on this 9 hour 30 minutes flight. SQ is still top notch when it comes to service delivery on board."
2017-10-29,9,9,"""cabin crew were friendly and gracious""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Singapore. This was a new A350 which was recently put in service. The seats were slightly narrower than the older business class seats; however in my opinion this does not decrease the comfort level. The seats were very comfortable and there were a lot of storage space for my belongings (to the point that we have to check every space before we leave the plane). The touch screen function is quite new from SQ and this made a lot of difference as older remotes can me quite tough to press as the plane ages. Service on the cabin was very good as usual; food was fantastic cabin crew were friendly and gracious. They were especially helpful towards by two parents, one with a wheelchair and the other less tech savvy with the entertainment system. Business class in SQ these days do not get much personal items given in the business class giveaway bag (compared to say LX and AY). However as this year was the 70th anniversary of SQ we were given a special leather bag."
2017-10-29,9,9,"""cabin service is fantastic""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London. Business class with my family for holiday. Daytime flight thus the service quality becomes very important as there were not much sleeping time. A380 has been in service for a while thus the seats are quite worn and despite the best maintenance it still shows, the buttons are tough to press and the inflight entertainment remote is also quite tough to be responsive; having said this they have promised to revamp the seats soon. The seats are quite wide and when converted to a bed the upper part of the seats are wide and comfortable but the lower part where the feet lays are a bit narrow. Food was fantastic as we applied for book the cook facility. The satay was amazing and the subsequent courses did not fail to please my family. Inflight entertainment was very good but I would have loved a wider collection of not-so-recent movies. The cabin service is fantastic; cabin crew makes an effort to recognize us and even some recognized us on other flights where they were on with us on a later date."
2017-10-29,9,9,"""Leg space is pretty good""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Jakarta route 1-2 times a month for 8 years. Compared to the competition for the same route, Singapore Airlines provides the biggest plane (AF used to serve the same route with their big plane but this ceased 2 years ago) with Garuda only providing 2 big planes for this route/ day. The big plane factor here matters, as the smaller planes tend to be parked away from the terminal and thus the passenger has to take a bus to the main terminal. Bigger planes almost always gets the aerobridge and thus the disembarkation process is way faster. For this 1.5 hour flight Singapore Airlines provides a meal (and also their full-service competition) and the speed of service for the food is amazing. The selection of food is pretty good however the selection for special diets have to be made online in advance. No connectivity on the flight. Leg space is pretty good compared to their competition; however the price for this route is pretty high, can be as high as a price from SIN to NRT on low season, for example."
2017-10-28,2,2,"""The seat was broken""","✅ Verified Review | Paris to Singapore, One of the lousiest flight I ever took! The seat was broken and the airline can’t find any replacement. The TV equipment at some of the aisle were also broken. I filed complaint but no feedback to date."
2017-10-26,9,9,"""impressed with cabin staff""","✅ Verified Review | Medium haul flight from Singapore to Bangkok. The plane was a rather dated B777. Nevertheless, the cabin was well maintained, and the seats were comfortable and offered sufficient legroom. The food was very tasty. However, I was most impressed with the service of the cabin staff. I was wearing a suit, and the flight attendant asked me whether he could put the suit jacket on a hanger, which has never happened to me with any other airline."
2017-10-23,3,3,"""horribly poor condition""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Singapore. I have to say the flight was in a very poor condition with Singapore Airlines. I was sitting on the upper level of the plan, and the interior is very dirty (marks everywhere on the walls, handles, corners) and seat covers torn when I looked around. The entertainment system is a joke, I think may be back in at least 10 years you will see those airlines are using those system that you can't play the movie you chosen from the beginning and have to play them half way based on the entertainment system schedules. I was shocked to see any airline are still using those kind behind entertainment system, don't even mention it's Singapore Airlines, which will charge extra amount of money for nothing! The food was ok, typical airline foods. Service is good, but be honest I rarely see bad service in any airline, so I'd say it's standard. Overall, the aircraft in horribly poor condition as well as its entertainment system!"
2017-10-22,9,9,"""food was delicious""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore Airlines is definitely one of the best. My flight from Singapore to Istanbul was punctual, the FAs were attentive and corteous, the seat was comfortable, the legroom was spacious, the food was delicious. The only downside was the IFE, the screen was small, blurry and not touchscreen, the earphones were not comfortable, for a long haul flight entertainment was an important aspect of the flight. I hope SQ put more attention to these small details"
2017-10-22,9,9,"""cabin crew friendly and courteous""","✅ Verified Review | Jakarta to Singapore. This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines and I was impressed. The flight was on time, the cabin crew was friendly and courteous. The cabin was really clean. It was a short haul flight which only lasted for 1 hr 45 mnt but really enjoyable. The food was decent for a short haul flight. It has 3-3-3 seat arrangement which is great and the legroom was spacious. I wish they could improve more on the flight entertainment system because even though the movie selection was great and had many new titles the touch screen was not responsive and the earphones were not comfortable enough"
2017-10-08,10,10,"""reliable and consistent service""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Bangkok. Singapore Airlines provides a reliable and consistent service. The flight attendants welcome passengers on board with smiles and are present to assist passengers to their seats and provide help with hand luggage, etc. There are 2 meal options and having flown this route over 5 times in the past 12 months, I have always managed to get the option of my choice. The entertainment options are wide and varied and the attendants present throughout the entire flight. The airline recently upgraded the earphones given out to passengers which passengers can bring home. Each earphone pack comes with 2 pairs of spare ear pieces of different sizes. This airline is definitely ahead of the curve and the challenge is to see how it maintains its lead during times where the industry is full of tough competitors without compromising on standards that its loyal customers have come to expect."
2017-10-06,10,10,"""amazing from start to finish""",✅ Verified Review | Sydney to London via Singapore. The service by Singapore Airlines was amazing from start to finish. Check in staff were friendly and helpful. On both flights the cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Food was good and there was a reasonable amount of entertainment to watch on the large personal screens.
2017-10-02,1,1,"""the worst customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Paris. My husband and I chose Singapore Airlines for the first time to visit my brother who lives in Singapore. We thought it was one of the best company. Unfortunately, it has the worst customer service we’ve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets (188 euros) to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldn’t use because of the delay were non-refundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA (because they don’t reply to emails), the company doesn’t deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets (52 euros). Not logical. Plus, they don’t want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines don’t have consideration for their customers. They don’t take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers. We will never fly again with Singapore Airlines."
2017-10-02,10,10,"""crews were very attentive""","✅ Verified Review | Barcelona to Melbourne via Singapore, a terrific flight on Singapore Airlines. Comfortable seats, great food and wines and exemplary staff. Both crews were very attentive and worked hard to ensure we had good flights. The new A350 seats are well-designed and the Inflight entertainment is easy to use with big screens. I have seen better videos choices, but the offer on SIA is good."
2017-09-29,10,10,"""food and service were efficient""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. AMS to SIN was in premium economy on an A350. The SIN to BNE sector was in standard economy on a Boeing 777. At this stage, Singapore Airlines doesn't offer premium economy to Brisbane. These two experiences were extremely different. In Premium, I paid a little extra to sit in the front row. I was able to extend my legs fully and adopt different seating positions. It was relatively comfortable. IFE was excellent. The large screen, extensive selection and quality headphones made the flight pleasant. Food was nice and the cabin crew were really professional. Changing in Singapore to standard economy - the seat was obviously narrower and my knees touched the seat in front. I could only adopt one sardine like position in my seat. All in all, it was quite uncomfortable for me. The food and service were efficient. The tiny screen was hard to see, having to often adjust the angle and on the 777, the selection was less than on the A350. In my opinion, there is a very distinct difference between standard and premium economy and I think the extra cost if well worth it."
2017-09-28,10,10,"""A wonderful experience""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Houston to Manchester. A wonderful experience - the stewards and stewardesses were very helpful and sensitive to our needs at all times. The food was excellent, every meal was hot and tasty and served with a smile. We had a little turbulence along the way but the Captain came on and re-assured everyone. I will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."
2017-09-23,3,3,"""never fly Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Verified Review | Our holiday involved four Singapore Airline flights, Sydney to Frankfurt via Singapore and return. I bought and paid for four preferred seats. I have replacement knees and whilst they slightly limit my mobility, they do not adversely impact on my upper body strength or general fitness. The preferred seats would have given me more leg freedom. I purchased the preferred seats on-line and disclosed that I had a mobility problem. The tickets were sold with full disclosure by me. On the flights, we were refused the seats. It was then explained to me that it was the decision of the Cabin Crew ""on the day"" whether a person could occupy the preferred seats or not. We were moved further back down (both) aircraft and other people were seated in the preferred seats at no cost to themselves. It seems that the cabin crew make a decision whether the people in preferred seats are fit enough to assist other passengers in the event of an emergency. A total farce really, because they do allow women with babies to utilise these spaces. (So much for being fit enough to assist) On the last flight, the senior Cabin Crew person indicated she was submitting a report to assist me in having the money returned. I wrote to Singapore Airlines in late August. My email was acknowledged, then no further contact was received. I rang the Sydney office today and was told the money would not be refunded because the Airlines has a ""Not Negotiable/No Refund policy on preferred seat sales. My point is that those seats should not have been sold to anyone without a clear indication that it was a decision for the Cabin Crew ""on the day."" It was unpleasant sitting well back watching other people enjoying the seats I paid for. I will never fly Singapore Airlines again."
2017-09-16,6,6,"""Overall a pleasant trip""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London Heathrow. I haven't flown SIA for over 5 years, and was looking forward to renewing my experience. Overall a pleasant trip, but they seem to rather a shadow of their former self. I guess they are getting attacked by low cost airlines and Middle eastern airlines that have stolen many of their customers? Staff were efficient during the set times for service, but outside that this is a rather disappointing level of attention for business class. I had flown LAX to Tokyo one week earlier with ANA business class and have to say they are streets ahead of SIA from a service viewpoint. Seat on this A380 was comfortable, a little hard to sleep on, but quite private. Meals seemed quite small and dull compared to former standards. Used the inflight entertainment at beginning of flight and quite a nice choice. I probably wouldn't put them as first choice next time - they are a whole lot better than BA, but that is like comparing a low cost airline against SIA."

Not a full flat bed in business class which is a shame but its only a 5 hour flight. No amenity kits. Lounge staff were excellent in Perth. Singapore lounges are now looking tired. Certainly one of the best flying out of Perth."
2017-09-14,8,8,"""didn't find anything that stands out""","✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore was my first trip with Singapore Airlines and the journey was flawless. The staff was nice and helpful, on ground and in the plane, the flight was on time. I had a Boeing 777 on the way in and A380 on the way back, and, since that was my first travel with the A380, I'll focus on this one. First of all, this plane is awesome! It's so massive and super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn't find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion. Seat was ok, I could sleep without too much discomfort, entertainment system was fine, no complaints about it. In the end, I had two nice flights, I really enjoy them but, I didn't find that the Premium Economy in a 5 stars airline was much different that a 4 star one. So, I'd recommend Singapore Airline, but, if you find the same seat category for less money in a less prestigious airline, I'd switch for the second one."
2017-09-08,9,9,"""Fabulous service by cabin crew""","✅ Verified Review | Munich to Singapore return, outbound Premium Economy, return in Business. Fabulous service by the cabin crew on both trips. On the outbound flight the purser went through the cabin twice and asked everybody whether everything is ok. At the end of the flight he shook hands to a lot of passengers and thanked for flying SQ. Never seen before. I took the available ""Cook the book"" option for Premium Economy and had a vey tasty meal (Salmon noodles). Seat in the first row of Premium Economy to be recommended the other rows looked a little bit cramped. A lot of drink rounds on the day flight and also snacks available. Could use the Lufthansa Lounge as Silver Card member LH, but a little bit crowded at noon time, Silver Kris Lounge on the return flight a better options for meals and snacks, however (as some here have already mentioned) crowded between 10.00pm and midnight and the furniture need to be renewed urgently. Boarding in Singapore is smooth, flights on time, even ahead of schedule, good choice of entertainment. Just one neative point: Even there were quite a lot free seats in Business on the outbound flight, it was not possible to redeem my LH Miles on this flight despite several attempts during the last 6 weeks before departure"
2017-09-04,10,10,"""highly recommend this airline""","✅ Verified Review | Surabaya to Singapore in economy class. It's visible from beginning it's good quality airline. I made online check-in to reserve seat before, all process without any problem. On the airport, baggage drop and boarding pass printing process went very smoothly. Because of small traffic on Surabaya airport security control process did not take much time. Also lounge was very nice and spacious. Boarding process was well organized. On board the service is on really good level. Staff speaks good English and is kind. Meal service was really tasty. Our plane was quite old and it was visible in the entertaiment system. Screen in my seat had some problems with touch screen and it was lagging but with additional remote I was able to use it. Before landing we got some information about connecting flights. All services was on time. I highly recommend this airline."
2017-08-31,10,10,"""two great flights""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Barcelona via Singapore, two great flights. Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good. The only slightly negative thing was the Silver Kris lounge in Singapore - very crowded, and the showers are showing their age. However, I thoroughly recommend Singapore Air and the new A350."
2017-08-15,10,10,"""service nice and attentive""","✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. My experience from HongKong to Kuala Lumpur was outstanding. I had booked the two flights on separate tickets as I had to add the trip to Kuala Lumpur on rather short notice. When booking the trip I took into account that the connection time in HKG was only 1 hour and 50 minutes between my SK flight and the Singapore flight. Being a frequent traveller with SAS I already asked to have my luggage checked through to Kuala Lumpur at Oslo airport, which was a very good choice as thus the SIngapore ground staff was prepared when the SK flight arrived in Hong Kong with a 80 minute delay. Despite I made it to the departure gate on my connection at last minute - exhausted after a long run through Hong Kong airport, the Singapore ground staff had already made a arrangement for me and my colleague to be booked on the next machine as the earlier flight had been anyway full. Both me and my colleague (who would not have made the connection as fast as me due to troubles at transfer security), we were both reassured, given new boarding passes and guided to the Singapore lounge for the next flight. All ground crew was very attentive and supportive and I appreciated this very foresighted arrangement, especially in the course that me and my colleague were actually booked on separate tickets. The flight itself was good, service was nice and attentive, but overall uneventful ."

The meal was not delicious, whereas they offered us various options for beverage. It was enough. We had a good time flying with them."
2017-08-07,2,2,"""crew rushed both services""","✅ Verified Review | Rome to Melbourne via Singapore. Check in Rome was quick, efficient and friendly but from there it was all downhill. Singapore Airlines use a common use airline lounge in Rome not affiliated with any specific airline. Lounge is very dated and standing room only when full as it was on this day. Food offerings were a stale pound cake and a bowl of nuts. The bar area was covered in dirty used glasses. I left the lounge and bought water from a vending machine. The aircraft was a refitted 777 that looked every bit it's 16 years old. The purser was very friendly and the rest of the crew in business class were also alright on the Rome to Singapore leg. The seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. The meal was not great and quality sub standard. The next flight out of Singapore to Melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. The crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down. Bread baskets thrust at passengers without offering bread. All done without uttering a single word to customers. From the noise coming out of the galley they were capable of talking and laughing just not with their customers. I wouldn't have given more than 2 stars from their product and crew ."
2017-08-06,9,9,"""crew are very professional""",✅ Verified Review | Dhaka to Shanghai via Singapore. It's my 2nd time fly to Singapore airline. Excellent service. Ground staff are helpful and polite. Cabin crew are very professional and trying their best give service to pessenger. Food choice is really great but wifi is too expensive. Onboard entertainment have many choice.
2017-08-05,2,2,"""disappointed by lack of water""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Melbourne. Our late departure was thankfully made up in the air however I was very disappointed by the lack of water offered or available on board for the flight. Dehydration set in and made for an uncomfortable flight. The breakfast of a bread roll and some spread was pretty pathetic too! Singapore Airlines needs to have drinks and snacks available to help yourself to like other 5 star airlines.
2017-08-03,9,9,"""impressed by the offering""","✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Singapore. First time trying the premium economy of Singapore Airlines, must I say I was really impressed by the offering and the value for money. Boarding in Hong Kong is done very orderly, Premium economy customers get to use the channel for gold card members. Separate counter for check in, priority luggage handling, and a generous allowance of 35kg! On board I was warmly greeted and shown to my new seat. Very impressed by the design, seat pitch, and storage space etc. Out of HK we had a delay of 1 hour due to heavy traffic, but crew handled it perfectly, with drinks and snacks given out, and air con on. Sharing the same toilet of economy is no problem at all. We were even offered champagne and nuts, not bad at all! Meals were from economy, but we could also book the cook for a few extra special dishes. Metal cutlery, wine and drinks offered. Nice premium ice cream offered at the end of the meal. AVOD has a large screen, touch screen for 777 and normal use of console for A380. Wifi is available, although not cheap, but those who needs it will find it very useful. Seat when reclined slightly, plus the footrest, makes for a very comfortable position for relaxation. For medium haul flight this is perfect. I can highly recommend it, sometimes the price can be cheaper than economy in high seasons."
2017-07-31,10,10,"""experience was fantastic""","✅ Verified Review | Manchester to Houston. 30th anniversary included a bucket list experience on Singapore Airlines new A350-900 aircraft. The experience was fantastic, the service superb, and Singapore Airlines lived up to its ranking. The cabin is so quiet and the seats are the widest. Lie flat seat provides enough space for my 6ft plus frame, even if I did have to tilt a little to fit my feet in the slot. IFE was full of movies on a great screen and the food was delicious, especially Tiramisu. Don't miss the Singapore Sling, the signature cocktail of the airline. Only negative is that the cabin can tend to be warm, and there are no individual vent controls to adjust comfort levels."
2017-07-30,9,9,"""I'd happily fly with them again""","✅ Verified Review | Stockholm to Singapore and onwards to Phuket. We booked 5 seats in a row, 3 on the left side and the next 2 seats in the middle. Flying economy, our expectations were fairly low, but we were pleasantly surprised by the seats. The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn't check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed. The plane itself was only a few months old at the time and felt very modern. Everything looked stylish and clean. All in all, I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines economy class on this flight. I have flown business class once before, and this was honestly not that far removed from that service, excluding the seat of course. I'd happily fly with them again!"
2017-07-27,4,4,"""food service is economy standard""","✅ Verified Review | London to Auckland via Singapore in Premium Economy. The seat width and leg room are marginally better than economy and is very hard and uncomfortable. Seating across cabin was 2-4-2. No toilet, use economy toilet and no closed off cabin. and food service is economy standards. Book a chef food arrives early so meal is consumed before wine service. The crew serve the premium and economy cabin so once you have been served don't expect to see crew again until meal service."
2017-07-24,9,9,"""seeking out the A350""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Singapore en route to Zürich in late June and it was the most pleasant economy class flight I have experienced. For someone who is 188cm tall, I generally struggle with the legroom provided in any economy class cabin but found the A350 provided a generous amount of seat width which meant I could angle myself slightly to avoid touching the seatback in front. The cabin staff were excellent in their attentiveness, and the upgraded IFE screens and controllers were a noticeable improvement from the ageing systems in the A380 and 777-300ER. Food and ground services were pleasant. Overall excellent experience and will be actively seeking out the A350 in my future travels."
2017-07-21,10,10,"""enjoyed my experience""","✅ Verified Review | Dubai to Seoul via Singapore, on a Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Singapore. The seat was massive and in great condition. The onboard entertainment was fantastic with a great selection of movies. The food was sensational with a good selection of drinks. My flight to Seoul was on an A330-300 which was slightly older and the seats were smaller. I was provided with the meal I had pre-booked and the flight was excellent. I flew back from Seoul and the service was exceptional. I had 8 hours in Changi airport and the silver Kris lounge provide a peaceful environment with great food and drinks available. My final flight to Dubai was the best flight. Amazing crew, meals and onboard entertainment. The crew very kind and asking to top up drinks. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience on Singapore Airlines."
2017-07-20,7,7,"""an inconsistent experience onboard""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Jakarta to Singapore return. Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well. Overall an inconsistent experience onboard SQ that has slightly declined since I flew them last three years ago."
2017-07-19,9,9,"""courteous and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | Enjoyed my trip from Singapore to Amsterdam in the A350. The best of it was arriving jetlag free, both ways. Normally I feel grotty for at least a couple of days. The service was the usual Singaporean courteous and efficient. The food was good and the ambience pleasant. Highly recommended."
2017-07-18,1,1,"""baggages nowhere to be found""","✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore, we were bumped to an earlier flight in Singapore with the reassurance that our baggages would be transferred to our new flight. Lo and behold, we arrived in Melbourne after enduring a painful flight in an old airplane with terrible food and fault inflight entertainment (had to be restarted twice) our baggages are nowhere to be found. Went to the baggage assistance area and talked to a very agitated agent who refused to explained the situation to us. Very disappointed with Singapore Airlines with this mix up. They are efficient when running smoothly within their protocols but anything out of ordinary reveals poor problem solving."
2017-07-16,9,9,"""always a pleasure""","✅ Verified Review | Business class on Singapore airlines is always a pleasure. From Singapore to San Francisco, attentive polite staff, great food, IFE system with many choices, easy check in, and now they use TSA Pre so my connection to a US carrier went smoothly as well. The only negative on the trip was the child in the row behind me who did what small children do from time to time. Ear plugs helped there. With SQ, the miles accumulation doesn't go very far, but ever since the US carreiers devalued FF miles, SQ is the way to go. THe WiFi is slow and $17 for the flight but if you need to check and send email it works."
2017-07-16,5,5,"""experience has been disappointing""","✅ Verified Review | Denpasar to Singapore, my experience has been disappointing. The lack of pillow and blanket on board was a concern, even though it was just a short flight, and the fact that it was a day flight didn't mean that blankets were not necessary. The cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked the crew for a blanket, the reply I got was they have run out. When the flight was approaching Singapore, we demanded for some disembarkation/embarkation cards, we only managed to get 2 for a total of 8 of us, because they have run out of these cards. In the end, we had to queue up before the immigration counter at Changi Airport to get the cards and to fill them in. The meal was very unsatisfying. Overall, the flight was just full of disappointment."
2017-07-11,10,10,"""very kind and cooperative""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. I was pleased with the smooth service of Singapore Airlines. Ground service in SFO was very friendly and tackled our problems efficiently. Aboard the plane, the flight attendants were very kind and cooperative. Cabin and seat features were very convenient and modern. The food was spectacular and movie choices were in a vast range. A blanket and pillow were provided even for a 3 hrs 50 min day flight from HKG to SIN. Overall, Singapore Airlines definitely brightened my trip to Singapore. (SIN airport was also grand and beautiful!)"
2017-07-11,9,9,"""Great plane and great flight""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to San Francisco. Initially when I flew on an A350 I felt that it was far too narrow unlike B777-300 ER. It's actually a very quiet plane and the seats are very comfortable. The lighting is very conducive especially for an overnight flight. However as I took SQ32 which was a morning flight out of Singapore it was some time before the cabin lights were switched off and when it does this is a super cool silent plane allowing one to relax and doze off to sleep and even when the lights are being switched on it was not like super glaring. Great plane and great flight and I did arrive fresher on this flight not when I flew on this aircraft for the first time in March than I would do on other types of aircraft.
2017-07-11,10,10,"""staff were very friendly""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Singapore. Singapore Airlines was awesome. They gave amazing meals and and customer service was great. The cabin staff were very friendly. Great people. The facilities were super. I did have some trouble with the wifi but I was still entertained by their range of music, games, movies, tv shows, etc. At the end of the flight I accidentally left my phone in the plane. I panicked and ran back to the plane however I was not allowed to re-enter. Then I saw the cabin staff and the manager as they were going home and I told them the situation. They quickly reacted asking me my seat number and three staff into the plane. I was very pleased by their efforts. The manager then calmed me down and everything. Shortly the men returned and thankfully they found my phone. I was very thankful to them as they took time out of their journey home to help with my situation."
2017-07-11,7,7,"""routine short haul flight""","✅ Verified Review | Jakarta to Singapore. The arrival of SQ960 was delayed and our flight SQ961 was delayed even further. This was on July 7th. The congestion at the airport meant more waiting and the captain allowed passengers to call family and friends to inform them of the severe delay whilst we were on the runaway behind 6 planes. It was not a refitted 777-300 but as I did not have any passenger next to me it was fine. There was no wifi on board. This was a routine short haul flight. The flight attendants served dinner, they looked stressed and very little smiles but I guess it's understandable."
2017-07-10,2,2,"""positive is inflight crew service""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Perth. A disappointing inflight experience with Singapore Airlines. Seats are old and stained. The inflight entertainment screen was stuck and the angle could not be adjusted. Food was too salty for me. Stained toilet seat and basin. Not worth paying more for these older facilities. The only positive thing is the good inflight crew service. Definitely not a 5 stars airline.
2017-07-08,1,1,"""horrible flight experience ""","✅ Verified Review | Perth to Singapore on the 3rd July and the most horrible flight experience I could get from a full service airline. Inattentive staff, cold food, broken in-flight entertainment equipment and terrible service. I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard. I had previously tried Scoot for the first time from Singapore to Perth. Although the food was terrible, they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by SQ on this particular flight. Before this flight, I absolutely adored SQ. Now, I am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment I received on flight. I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot. I don't think any customer deserves to be put through the horrible treatment my friend and I received on this flight. I honestly would have liked not having to sit through this torture."
2017-06-30,6,6,"""not really impressive""","✅ Verified Review | London to Melbourne via Singapore. The premium economy is not really impressive. The seats are a bit bigger, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have a window seat in economy and wedge myself into a comfort. It is handy if you want to do some work on your laptop during the flight, but not if you want to sleep. Singapore Airlines is a reasonable premium economy class option, but not as good as Qantas. The food is standard economy which I think should be expected. The extra money is paying for the seat. But I battled in it and didn't find the extra space that worthwhile. The Wifi on SIA is an absolute joke. It was $10 for something like 50MB. I had to reload twice during the flight. Overall, I didn't think it was worth the price. If you are going to dig your hand into your pocket and spend money, go business. If not, grin and bear it in economy."
2017-06-30,9,9,"""Overall the flight was ok""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Beijing, flight took 7 hrs. It was a night flight so after the seatbelt sign has been switched off the flight attendant gave the amenity kits followed by beverages and peanuts. It was quite smooth flight and the inflight entertainment was up to date. It has a feature of 3D maps that can locate us in real time. I also used for on board wifi but unfortunately Emirates has better offer for on board wifi due to less cost amount money compared to Singapore Airlines. In the morning the crew served a breakfast with two different menu. I had the egg vegetable frittata. Prior to landing a hot towel was served. Overall the flight was ok."
2017-06-28,9,9,"""best service with a smile""","✅ Verified Review | I had checked in online for my Singapore Airlines flight from Jakarta to Singapore and it was quite smooth. As I got to the airport the bag drop counter also handled the service quite well and quick. The flight was slightly delayed but luckily we got on time. The service was good, as I boarded the aircraft one flight attendant escorted me to my seat. She even helped me out to put all of my things in the overhead bin. For the food, nothing better than Singapore Airlines food. That Lasagna with smoked chicken salad impressed me well. They also served a complete set menu for economy class starting from appetizer, main course and dessert. The chocolate mousse was totally delicious. The inflight entertainment was up to date. It had quite new movies and some great series, but unfortunately the screen had a slow response as I clicked the remote to move the channel. Overall the service was great, all cabin staff gave their best service with a smile."
2017-06-22,7,7,"""Seats were pretty uncomfortable""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore Airlines from Delhi to Singapore. The flight from Delhi to Singapore went well. However, the crew on the Singapore to Adelaide sector were terrible, I had to witness a dirty toilet early in the morning before landing. Seats were pretty uncomfortable as well."
2017-06-22,8,8,"""The seats were comfortable""","✅ Verified Review | The flight on the San Francisco - Hong Kong sector was a long haul one and went through a longish route which had lots of turbulence. The Hong Kong - Singapore flight was shorter of 3 hours and was very smooth. The long haul flight was of 14 hours. A big meal was served after take-off though it was 2 am. It does not make sense to serve a heavy dinner at that odd time. Instead they could serve a good breakfast at around 7 am (PST). Then only snacks for the entire flight and another heavy meal just an hour before landing. This thing is a nuisance because you cant really enjoy a meal if you know you have to land in another hour. The breakfast served on the HKG-SIN sector was good and well timed. The toilets were clean and had the basic amenities. IFE was good on both flights. The seats were comfortable and so was the lighting etc. A big thank you to the SQ ground staff at SFO who excused my excess baggage of 5 kilos, without any extra charge. That was a very kind gesture and they put a tag on my bags to say that it was 'heavy""."
2017-06-21,2,2,"""this flight was a terrible disappointment""","✅ Verified Review | My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again."
2017-06-16,9,9,"""standard product is so good""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Munich. Overall another good flight. For some reason they didn't do priority boarding parents traveling with infants which caused a bit of a bottleneck on the air bridge. Flight departed 10 min late but arrived 5 min early. Staff were friendly and the service constant throughout the flight. Having now flown Premium economy and Economy back to back I can't see the value in paying extra for Premium economy as the standard product is so good. Only downside was the time it took the luggage to come out.
2017-06-14,4,4,"""lost its service quality""",✅ Verified Review | Guangzhou to Singapore. Singapore Airles has lost its service quality. Its virtually impossible to use my hundred of thousands KrisFlyer points for upgrades. The required ticket type is nearly the cost of the business fare in the first place!! Points have been progressivly devlaued with unecessary expiry dates. SQ is locked in the past. The budget airliens are beating it on service standards. There was a time when SQ was my preferred carrier. Sadly its no longer the case. The outdated one way vs two way ticket cost differential means I use other airlines more and more frequently becuase I need the flexibility in rescheduling flights. SQ should look at Jetstar Asia if it wants to see what modern customer standards are like. (Believe me I never thought I would write in favour of Jetstar.)
2017-06-13,1,1,"""never fly with this airline again""","✅ Verified Review | Munich to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore. I will never fly with this airline again. My wife and I booked two seats from Madrid to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. We had a big drama at the airport in Munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from Vietnam. We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn't our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn't even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry? On arrival to Vietnam, we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged. The airline did replace them however we had to go through the drama of filling out forms/taking photos at the airport after a very long flight."
2017-06-13,9,9,"""Overall, a great experience""","✅ Verified Review | Adelaide to Singapore and the best crew I have had on a flight. Two members addressed passengers (including myself) by name for the whole flight. Attendants were chatty and polite, and spent time providing passengers with hints of what to see and do in Singapore. Very frequent rounds of drinks. Aircraft was clean. IFE was not the latest generation but the screen size was big enough and the selection of movies was more than adequate. The only downside was food, where Singapore Airlines normally does not shine. Portions were big but quality can be better. Ground staff at Adelaide airport very polite and helpful. SilverKris lounge small but well-stocked. Overall, a great experience."
2017-06-12,8,8,"""constant unobtrusive service was excellent""","✅ Verified Review | From an earlier, not very pleasant experience on the same route, our recent flight with Singapore Airlines flying from Johannesburg to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore was outstanding and living up to the 10/10 I expected. The welcome from the crew and constant unobtrusive service was excellent. It was a 10 hr flight and there was always drinks or snacks available and a cheerful crew member to serve it. The only downside is that on a 2am departure the only food offered as a meal is a cheese roll! Not what you want at that time of the day after hanging around at the airport and next meal in 8 hrs time. Other than that it was a great flight and the crew were excellent."
2017-06-08,2,2,"""losing its quality""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Colombo with Singapore Airlines. The check in has been fully automated. You have to tag your own baggage and no staff is around to assist. Crew is quite rude and didn't care much about the passengers. Food is bland and the service is not that good. Wouldn't recommend. I think Singapore Airlines is losing its quality.
2017-06-08,9,9,"""flight crew were fantastic ""","✅ Verified Review | Munich to Singapore. First time flying with a baby so we were a bit apprehensive. The flight crew were fantastic making sure we were looked after, from coming over to invite us to board and making sure we have everything we need. The food service was prompt, staff came around with drinks, just before the lights are dimmed they give out water bottles. Flight left 5 min late but arrived 10 min early bags were only the belt when we got out of immigration. I was also told that from Aug 2017 the Boeing 777-300ER will be completely replaced by the A350. Only downside the hand controller stopped working to had to reach the bulkhead to change channels. As a full reset would cause issues for the row behind me and take 10 min I wasn't bothered, the staff said they would do it as soon as the others fell asleep. To their credit 6 hours later once the other dosed off the reset was done. Great flight, they will always be on the top of my list of carriers to fly."

Food is great and is finished with Teh Tarik Ice Cream, SQ's 70th Anniversary gift to passengers. Toilet is clean and well-maintained. The flight is on-time. SQ (Silk) Singapore-KL-Singapore: This is just a short flight, approx. 45 min. Seats seems to be worn-out already but has generous space. The aircraft is clean. Entertainment is available through wi-fi but who needs one for a 45-minute flight. Newspapers are available (e.g. Strait Times, etc.) Friendly and generous crew. The flight is on-time."
2017-05-27,4,4,"""improve the overall pleasantness""","✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them. However, my recent two legs felt mediocre at best and made me question my general stance. The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn't justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers."
2017-05-26,7,7,"""service seems to be going downhill""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Denpasar. In general, Singapore Airlines was good, however, their service seems to be going downhill. Dining experience was slow - the cabin crew on the other section of economy cabin even had finished their service completely while the cabin crew on my section had just finished halfway. Another thing was there was no consistency since the crew started from wrong direction. Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover. Since the crew on my section was so slow; therefore, they expected us to finish our meal so fast so they could clear up. I have traveled with them a lot and I have been in business class. I didn't compare it with business but this was the first time in my flight with them in economy that the service was slow, ran out of choices, no food cover, non-focused cabin crew, etc. I hope they can improve before it goes down to far and losing their loyal customers further"
2017-05-21,9,9,"""certainly use Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Manchester via Singapore. No problems checking in. Excellent food and attentive friendly cabin crew. Became quite cool on overnight flight. Would take a sweater next time. Entertainment very good. Priority ticket on bags worked well and bags soon out on carousel at end of flight. Found seat to be comfortable and spacious when sitting, plenty of leg room, but not so comfortable to sleep on when turned onto a bed. Only small area to place your feet when lying down. Overall would certainly use Singapore Airlines again."
2017-05-20,7,7,"""Cathay Pacific remains one step above""","✅ Verified Review | I had high expectations of Singapore Airlines but this flight from Shanghai to Singapore was just good. Plane was the oldest A380-800 which will be retired in few months. Good IFE but not touch-screen. Selection of movies was good but should be improved. As a Star Alliance Gold member, I was given a seat in the small Economy class section on the upper deck. As such a section was quite empty, I had a full row for myself. Service was good, smiling and polite cabin crew, but not the most proactive. Drinks selection was rather limited for a 5 hours flight, no sparking wine available. The hot meal served was of poor quality. Based on my experience, I think Cathay Pacific remains one step above."
2017-05-19,8,8,"""The service was good""","✅ Verified Review | Kolkata to San Francisco via Singapore. From Kolkata was an A330, good and comfortable. Food and drinks were served though it was a late night flight. Transit in Singapore was smooth. Changi is a nice airport to transit through. The second flight was on a A350-900 the so-called next-gen aircraft; but I didn't find it too comfortable. The service was good with an efficient crew. A simple amenity kit was provided and the washrooms also had the basic supplies. The food was good and sufficient. Snacks were available in the galley. However, I did not like the cramped seating of the A350. Arrival was smooth and on time."
2017-05-18,1,1,"""Two thumbs down""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to San Francisco. I previously had positive things to say about Singapore Airlines, but in this case, I was very frustrated. I paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom. Instead, the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. In addition, the TV was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight, I could not watch any TV. Two thumbs down."
2017-05-12,1,1,"""disappointing travel experience""","✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore with Singapore Airline. It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I would’ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything. I am not upset about my luggage not being able to get on my second flight but I'm deeply disappointed about the service and how the staff handled it. I will never take Singapore Airline or recommend to my family and friends."
2017-04-21,10,10,"""truly pleasant flights""","✅ Verified Review | Dusseldorf to Hanoi via Singapore. Both segments were truly pleasant flights. The check-in and boarding were well organized and quick. The cabin crews on both flights were very kind and helpful. On DUS-SIN they frequently served drinks, snacks and apples were available as well. I had the same excellent experience on SGN-SIN and SIN-DUS, so I would definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again."
2017-04-19,10,10,"""so welcomed by the crew""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Amsterdam. I felt so welcomed by the crew. The flight attendants were helping and greeting passengers and bringing them to their seat and helped them putting away their hand luggage. The meal service was very quick and efficient. Overall they flight was very pleasant and comfortable! The flight attendants did Singapore Airlines proud and showed why this airlines has one of the best crew service! I would recommend everybody to fly Singapore Airlines.
2017-04-19,1,1,"""Don't bother to help""",✅ Verified Review | Cape Town to Singapore. Don't bother to hang your jacket. Don't bother to help open up your bedding but one has to struggle with it oneself. Rude interaction. Don't bother to help with opening the table for meals. Often forget to offer some passengers cheese and fruit when it is standard for all business class. Poor lounge food choice with only Indian food available to eat. Don't allow couples to travel together.
2017-04-19,9,9,"""consider to fly again with Singapore""","✅ Verified Review | Istanbul to Singapore. Best cabin crew experience, and very helpful during the 10 hour flight. Served frequently snacks and drinks. I personaly congratulated chief of cabin crew, who didn't stop to serve passengers during the whole flight. I will seriously consider to fly again with Singapore."
2017-04-13,9,9,"""it was 5 star flight""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Bangkok. It was a very pleasant flight, no delay, quick and effective service at fantastic Singapore airport. Although the flight was almost full the services on board were well organized. Of course I should mention wonderful air hostess. They looked like top models. Overall it was 5 star flight."
2017-04-07,9,9,"""gracious and much appreciated act""","✅ Verified Review | Jakarta to Singapore. Exemplary customer service experience from Garuda and Singapore Airlines. Our flight scheduled to depart at 15:20 from Pontianak to Jakarta on 27 March, was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather (heavy thunderstorm). We missed our connecting flight scheduled to depart at 19:00 from Jakarta to Singapore. Upon arrival in Jakarta we brought our case to Garuda customer service and it was promptly processed. There's no flight available for the day so we were put in hotel with dinner and breakfast voucher. The next day Garuda customer service staff went to Singapore Airlines office and they were able to release 2 tickets for us to fly back to Singapore on that day. A gracious and much appreciated act from Garuda and Singapore Air. Thank you!"
2017-04-05,4,4,"""didn't feel worth the premium""",✅ Verified Review | My experience with Singapore Airlines was decent at best. The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didn't feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.
2017-03-27,9,9,"""lounge staff were very courteous""",✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFO-HKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep. The HKG-SIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.
2017-03-27,7,7,"""A350 seats were somewhat closer""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to San Francisco. The A350 seats were somewhat closer than the Boeing 777. The seats has the length but does not appear to be as wide. The toilet is very cool with state of the art flushing etc. Normally I am able to sleep well on board but maybe because it is a day flight I suffered from jet lag later in the week. Crew was excellent and attentive to our needs and there were loads of request for food by my fellow passengers.
2017-03-25,8,8,"""a very enjoyable trip""","✅ Verified Review | Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats."
2017-03-24,6,6,"""nothing was offered voluntarily""","✅ Verified Review | Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent, but I wasn't as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front, and the service area / galley located well to the rear past an economy section, the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual dead-end rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFO-SIN sector, received two meals during the 16h20m flight, with no other proactive service - no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives? The check-in experience at SFO was ok, but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self check-in kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before, but based on my limited experience with them so far, I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them - although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point."
2017-03-23,5,5,"""cabin crew seemed almost robotic""","✅ Verified Review | First time with Singapore Airlines. Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didn't and couldn't fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didn't turn on entertainment system this time. I think SQ is highly overrated and not a patch on Emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. Would consider others before SQ next time."
2017-03-22,5,5,"""comfortable with lots of storage space""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Seoul via Singapore in business class. Checkin in BKK efficient, fast track security and immigration took less than 10 min. SQ lounge in BKK efficient. Flight comfortable with decent food. Singapore Changi lounge good, with decent food and drinks. Long flight to Seoul with new business class seat. Seat very comfortable with lots of storage space and good IFE. Food was of poor quality and quantity. This was for sure the worst ever business class meal ever. I pre-ordered the ""Signature"" lobster thermidor. It was awful. Small overbooked pieces of lobster swimming in butter on a lobster shell. Served with limb overcooked asparagus. The breakfast wasn't any better. I like SQ because of its great service, but the food served on this sector will let me think twice before booking SQ again."
2017-03-20,10,10,"""the service is great""","✅ Verified Review | SQ 305 from LHR to SIN onboard Singapore Air's Boeing 777 four class cabin was one of the best long haul in economy flights I've endured. The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747. Overall the most comfy and best way to fly direct to Singapore from London in economy class but price will still dictate choices and whilst I'd pay a small Premium to fly Singapore again a harder discount from BA or Garuda would sway me."
2017-03-11,10,10,"""Excellent staff service""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Paris. Excellent staff service. Thank, once again, to cabin crew who provided excellent service during the flight,and were always smiling, patient, prompt and helpful. The food and beverage was satisfied. Thank, also, to pilots for so sweet landing in Parisian fog."
2017-03-10,3,3,"""not travel Singapore Airlines in future""","❎ Unverified | Sydney to Singapore. We are very disappointed that we arrived 5 hours before the departure to get seats in row 30's and we were told its all full. As we are older people in early 70's. We were told we should select our seats by Internet. We checked 48hrs before departure online however all seats were allocated, the seats available were the same seats open 48hrs ago. What a shame that airline has no remorse to senior people. We are seating in toilet class row 56's. As seniors we make two or three trips a year however we haven't encountered this situation in our travelling time. Manager was not considerate or seriously shown any interest. Remember sorry does not make pain go away. I will advise the all the family and friends not to travel Singapore Airlines in future."
2017-03-06,1,1,"""use the old luggage""","✅ Verified Review | Dubai to Singapore via Penang. First time fly with Singapore Airlines and will be final. I thought everything is perfect not until when I received my new luggage, with the Protection cover missing and the pocket zip is broken. When I file a complaint to Customer service, and the response is that it is due to the luggage is wear and tear, Singapore Airlines could not submit the damage claim to the insurance company and that's it. My conclusion, Singapore Airlines is very irresponsible, if you want to fly with them please ensure your luggage is wrapped or use the old luggage."
2017-03-05,5,5,"""expensive airline with a lot of online hype""","✅ Verified Review | My wife and I thought we would treat ourselves to Premium Economy on a recent holiday to Southeast Asia on both the main legs, London to and from Singapore. We usually fly BA premium economy, but this was part of a package and we upgraded the flight. We are in our 70's and cannot cope with economy over 13 hours To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. The only good thing is the seat but the service is very poor. Firstly if you ""Book the Cook "" a pre-ordered meal, it will be served long before anyone else. The promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. This is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service. We were allocated Row 31 which has extra legroom but as the seat plan shows it is right next to the galley and we were constantly disturbed throughout the whole flight. Under no circumstances would I use this cabin again - not a patch on BA"
2017-03-05,6,6,"""flight has no WiFi""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Sydney. I always fly Singapore Airlines as it offers the most direct flights out of Singapore. Flew on SQ241 on Feb 8th. SQ advises that all their SQ flights with B777-300ER and A350/380 has wi-fi. Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry. I can understand that most of the passengers are doing a transit but there are many of us who are just starting our day and with a flight at 0700 there is not much time for breakfast. I would appreciate if SQ indicate clearly which flights have wifi and not a blanket statement about the aircraft.
2017-03-02,10,10,"""always consider flying with them""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore Airlines for a family vacation to Bangkok from Singapore. Everything was a breeze from online check-in to boarding and deplaning. The aircraft was clean and tidy. The cabin crew were attentive to passenger needs. The meal was delicious and sufficient enough. Before take off, the crews distribute hot towels to passengers so you can freshen up. The flight was smooth including landing. Inflight entertainment is great as there are so many choices of movies or music to listen to. Singapore Airlines is a great airline and I would always consider flying with them. During seat sale, they offer fares that are even cheaper than low-cost carrier. With Singapore Airlines you have meals and free luggage allowance of up to 30 kgs."
2017-03-01,10,10,"""Food is good and generous""",✅ Verified Review | Manila to Hong Kong via Singapore. Excellent service from their staff. Food is good and generous it's hard to beat. Singapore Airlines innovates and tries further to give better service to their customers. Plane feels a bit old already but facilities and amenities are well appointed.
2017-02-28,6,6,"""Service lacked enthusiasm""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Munich, and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines. I hope SIA will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for Premium Economy on all segments."
2017-02-28,7,7,"""very happy with the service""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore. My recent journey with Singapore Airlines was really great, the crew was friendly and helpful. Me and wife were traveling with 1 year old baby and we felt like one of the staff was appointed specially to us. We are very happy with the service. Thank you Singapore Airlines. I would give 10/10 for service, but I have to give only 7/10 for flight as it was very old and noisy flight ."
2017-02-25,9,9,"""really comfortable and spacious""",✅ Verified Review | Seoul to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Both sectors of this trip were fantastic. I rated all aspects of the flight experience very highly. Starting from the smooth check-in to the high quality food served at the lounges to the care from the flight crew. The meals were very good especially when the 'Book the chef' option is used. It's worth noting that the business class suites on the Boeing 777-300ER was newer than the ones on A380-800 but despite having a few more features (incl. newer AVOD and more storage compartments) both were really comfortable and spacious.
2017-02-24,10,10,"""generous seat width""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can't wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated."
2017-02-24,8,8,"""all in all great hard product""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Singapore. Was expecting more but very good all the same. Never flown Singapore Airlines for some reason. Used the United Airlines lounge at LHR T2 as better facilities, great breakfast and bar. Boarding ontime. Boeing 777-300ER with new business but not that new now. Took row 11 bulkhead, feet forward as opposed to angle. Great space for Business class with 1-2-1 seating. Far bigger than British Airways F seats. First Cabin of business only 3 rows so intimate. Being an early morning service brunch was served. A little too quickly for my liking virtually immediately after levelling out. Preordered book the cook Lobster , very good. Service and quality of food excellent. Cabin staff attentive if a little sterile. My TV system wouldn't work for a few hours. Crew tried hard to rectify and offered to move our seats. FInally got it working all ok. Flight services director appeared later with a SGD200 voucher for the inconvenience. That is good customer service. Slept for 4 hours. Breakfast prior arrival SIN good, arrived early. All in all great hard product, good food and service."
2017-02-22,9,9,"""my best flight ever""","✅ Verified Review | From boarding in Dusseldorf to reaching Changi, everything went smooth. We were greeted by professional well-presented crew. Upon reach my seat in Premium Economy I wanted to take photo of my seat, where a cabin crew delightfully approached if she can take a picture for me while sitting and said ""it is great to have you on-board Sir and I would like to assure that your special meal is loaded"". We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product. The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean. The air ventilation can be really felt and cabin design made me feel relaxed. The Captain announced turbulence, and crew walked through the cabin to ensure we have fastened seatbelts. Before landing, breakfast was served and immigration cards handed out. We landed in time and I left the aircraft as a happy passenger with a feeling that this was my best flight ever."
2017-02-20,2,2,"""didn't feel I got value-for-money""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London Heathrow. I've flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand, and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy, and the in-flight entertainment screens are bigger, but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. I'm a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier, and I didn't enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the ""book the cook"" and his meals seemed better quality, but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout, the flight attendants were rushing around and didn't smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didn't find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you can't stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said I'm only 5'3"", my 6'1"" companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However, we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing, there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme. All-in-all extremely disappointed, didn't feel I got value-for-money compared to regular Economy class. This experience has really put me off flying Singapore Airlines again."
2017-02-20,3,3,"""food was not up to scratch""","✅ Verified Review | Copenhagen to Brisbane via Singapore. SAS Lounge in CPN comfortable and food looked OK, was not sure re wine out of a tap and so left this alone. The only other alcohol in the Business Class lounge was beer. Flight left on time and crew started working down one side of the Business Class cabin almost immediately, the other side took substantially longer. In any case the crew were helpful, the food was fine and the seat comfortable. Wine was good and topped up. A short stay in the lounge at Changi T3 and then re-boarded the same plane at the same gate (different flight number). Crew still fine but food was not up to scratch, the steak was very overcooked to the point of being really tough. The vegetables were mush, I didn't eat much and the crew member asked if I wanted anything else but I went to sleep instead. Supper coming into Brisbane was better. Waited 25 minutes for one bag in BNE, the other didn't arrive. Filled in the details at the airport. Have not heard back, no one answers the baggage service phone although you can leave a message that no one responds to as well. Calling Singapore Airlines they give you the number for Menzies Aviation that you have already called, they also mentioned that they would call back but have not. The online bag track system has had the same message on it for 6 days. In all the standard here is not commensurate with the full business class fare paid. The main advantage of the flights was being able to sleep, arriving on time is good but not when you are without your luggage and the follow up is so poor."
2017-02-19,3,3,"""a low level of enthusiasm""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Munich. A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to. Landed at about 6:00 am and was in a taxi at about 9:00 am, which is far too long. The slow processing on arrival in Munich reflected the poor quality of the whole experience. Luckily the seat was so comfortable I had slept really well."
2017-02-19,6,6,"""soon have tough competition""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore Airlines is dropping their lead over other airlines. While service is still consistent as it was for many years, nothing has changed and the food is everytime getting worse. I have flown Singapore Airlines in last 2 months a few times and the main courses offered I could not eat them and left them. No question asked of course. Being the most expensive and for long time leading they better watch or they will soon have tough competition."
2017-02-17,1,1,"""never fly Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Jakarta return. I always had a good experience on Singapore Airlines, until December 4 and again December 8, 2016. I flew from Singapore to Jakarta and then back to Singapore. When I booked, I gave SIA my United Mileage Plus account number so I could get credit for the two short flights. I was told it was in my profile and even showed up on my two boarding passes for both flights. When a month went by and I did not see any credit in my UA Mileage Plus account for the two SIA flights, I contacted Mileage Plus to look into it. I was told by UA that I was not getting credit because my flights were in K class economy, and that was ineligible to get miles on United, even though SIA is a Star Alliance Partner. I then took my complaint to SIA who told me something I had never heard of ""when you book in K, V, Q or N Class you only get miles on SIA."" What? I flew on the plane, I paid for my ticket and SIA only gives miles for their Kris Flyer program? Lame, .stupid and unfair. Part of my flights to Singapore, part of my trip was on ANA and they gave me full mileage credit on UA Mileage Plus for the NRT-SIN leg. I will never fly Singapore Airlines again."
2017-02-14,8,8,"""very impressed by Singapore Airlines""","✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore. Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it. They even fasten seat belts for passengers who were sleeping, never seen such care on another airline. Breakfast was served before landing and immigration cards were handed in time. At all times, crew were caring and meticulously dressed. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines and thier product. Definately my first option to Asia."
2017-02-12,2,2,"""clearly shows this is a direct flight""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to San Francisco. I have an email with my itinerary showing the flight is from Singapore to San Francisco. There are no words about a 1hr 30 mins stop in Hong Kong. Only today I realized the flight is through Hong Kong. If I had known that, I wouldn't choose this company at all. The agent was surprised to see my itinerary as it clearly shows this is a direct flight."
2017-02-11,1,1,"""service was slow and disappointing""","✅ Verified Review | Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating."
2017-02-06,8,8,"""service was impeccable""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Chennai return. The outbound flight was excellent in terms of being on time, the inflight service was impeccable. The seafood that I normally order was very very good. The flight crew were friendly and helpful as I needed some help with ordering in flight duty free goods. On the return from Chennai to Singapore, the service during the flight was bad. The cabin crew with their robotic attitude were interested to finish the service as soon as possible, to disappear from sight. Other than that I do not have any complaint to make."
2017-02-01,3,3,"""check the cost of your tickets""","✅ Verified Review | Perth to Vientiane via Singapore. Beware the stopover with Singapore Airlines. My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each! So I won't be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover"
2017-01-29,5,5,"""worth the extra ... I don't think so""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment."
2017-01-29,7,7,"""cost cutting measures were apparent""","❎ Unverified | Tokyo Haneda to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Old Boeing 777-300 but refurbished. PTVs are not the latest ones, no touchscreen but good picture quality. Good service, but cost cutting measures were too apparent. SIA used to gorgeously serve meals to economy passengers. Now, the big meal tray comes with only one small box of mains, another super tiny box of salad, one piece of cold bread and that's it. They also need to increase speed of in flight meal. Learn from other airlines such as United and Air China. They are super 'meh' airline companies but their speed of conducting meal service is admirable."
2017-01-28,4,4,"""I was bitterly disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Paris CDG. It's been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far, I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired, seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was, almost from start to finish. Yes, they got the service done, but there wasn't a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy, they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia, and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times, things seem to have gone the other way for SIA. Have the return flight next week and will update after that."
2017-01-24,6,6,"""Boeing 777-200 had an old interior""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Copenhagen. I usually fly this route with Singapore Airlines and have found my satisfaction declining with their offer lately. There was over a one and a half hour delay to our departure with no apology from the captain or crew when we landed in Copenhagen. There was quite some turbulence on this flight and the plane appeared to be struck by lightning at one point which was also not commented on by the captain despite many passengers being visibly shaken by the experience. The Boeing 777-200 had an old interior with the entertainment system not working on my seat nor those of my two companions. The interiors of these planes are simply not up to standard for a 5-star airline and are well overdue for their scheduled upgrade. The crew were courteous and attentive and regularly came through the cabin with refreshments.
2017-01-23,10,10,"""Just great service""","✅ Verified Review | Manchester to Houston. Boarding, food, space of seats, customer service etc all excellent. 10/10 and will use again. I booked this flight as it was good value and a direct flight for our trip. First time using Singapore Airlines and would say they are the best airline I have been on. Looked after so well on the flight. Even getting different seat options to give us more space. Just great service."
2017-01-22,8,8,"""the seats were spacious""","✅ Verified Review | I flew on Singapore Airlines (SQ) from Sydney to Chennai via Singapore last December. This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn't also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven't had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350's being delivered."
2017-01-21,1,1,"""told I didn't check in baggage""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Singapore. I have for the second time in 2 years lost my baggage. This time I arrived last night and my baggage never appeared on the carousel. I went to report it missing to be told that I didn't check in any baggage. I flew with two fellow workers who verified that I did (not sure why they didn't believe me) and I left my details. After numerous calls in the morning, I was told my baggage had turned up on another carousel at T3, and they would call me when it was being delivered. That was early this morning, it is now 4.30pm and I cannot get though to the ""hot line"" to check if they could give me an approximate time, no joy there either. Shocking service, for an airline that's talks up its service mantra. I travel constantly and if I wasn't coming home I would have been stranded.."
2017-01-20,9,9,"""crew were super attentive""","✅ Verified Review | Copenhagen to Singapore. Normally I fly BA, but this was the most direct flight to our final destination. My first time traveling Singapore Airlines in business and it was in a class of its own. Attention to detail was incredible, food tasted and looked great and the seat (even though it was there 'old' seat) was so wide and comfortable it was great for lounging and sleeping. The crew were super attentive but I feel they lack in making conversation. IFE I felt could also be improved but these are minor details for an otherwise impeccable flight."
2017-01-20,10,10,"""crew was outstandingly friendly""","✅ Verified Review | It was my first time aboard the new Singapore Airlines A350. Although it was a very short flight between Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, it was fantastic. The A350 cabin seems very bright and spacious, the Singapore Airlines design is elegant and modern. The crew was outstandingly friendly and professional and made this short hop one of the best flights I've ever taken."
2017-01-17,10,10,"""comfortable and completely hassle free""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore Airlines from Sydney to Singapore. A380 Closed Suites were amazing. The privacy, the special meal, which was Boston Lobster in my case and the Noise canceling headphones gave me enough comfort to take a nap, watch a movie and write a journal about the 5 days that I've spent in Sydney Australia before boarding this flight. Very comfortable and completely hassle free. The flight attendants were there anytime I needed and Seat 1A was great."
2017-01-15,6,6,"""flight below usual standards""","✅ Verified Review | The flight was below usual Singapore Airlines standards. It was a first generation Boeing 777-200 fitted with outdated seats, personal tv screens etc. Even the business Class seat was at least 10+ years old recliner. Service was quick and food was ok. I did not feel to get the level of service you would expect when you pay extra money to fly Singapore Airlines."
2017-01-14,9,9,"""can't fault their inflight crew""","✅ Verified Review | Flight from London Heathrow to Singapore. I had booked the flight through a partner airline and had made several attempts to arrange an aisle seat prior to the flight, however as it was a full flight, this was not possible. However, the airline did assign seats prior to the departure, which was helpful. I have flown with Singapore Airlines several times, and can't fault their inflight crew, who are helpful and try to accommodate any requests. Is one of my preferred airline for bookings in the future."
2017-01-13,1,1,"""little and infrequent information""",✅ Verified Review | Moscow to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened. I spent my time and did that. In return I received a standard email with apologies.
2017-01-10,9,9,"""I got my choice of meal""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Singapore return. I had little to no queue at the check-in counters at both Bangkok and Singapore airports. Boarding was orderly and in accordance to the boarding group indicated on the tickets. In Bangkok, the staff hold up clear signs indicating doors to use by premium passengers and economy passengers. The A330 was quite new and comfortable. The screen for the IFE is large and has plenty of movies and programmes available. Two options were available for meals and in both journeys, I got my choice of meal despite sitting in the last row. I opted for the red chicken curry for the outgoing flight and stir fried pork with fried rice for the return flight. Both delicious and portions adequate. Although the seats were in the last row, they were able to recline with some room to spare before hitting the wall. The toilets were near the last row of seats but they were positioned further back, toward the galley area. Cabin crew worked hard on this 2 hour flight with hot towels given at the beginning of the flight and a meal service with coffee/tea run after the meal. One thing useful is the foot pedal that is attached to the toilet trashbins. This is a feature I have not seen on some new planes of other airlines. Toilets were well stocked."
2017-01-10,10,10,"""experience was a pleasant one""","✅ Verified Review | Brisbane to Singapore and the experience was a pleasant one from the very first welcome. I am overjoyed that Singapore Airlines has reinstated the lager B777-200ER on this route especially in Business Class as it provides a 1-2-1 layout, with the long haul business class product rather than the 2-2-2 regional layout. The crew was very attentive and welcoming, taking meal orders before take off. Food was excellent as were drinks.On the overnight flight you have the choice of either a meal after take off or before landing. I choose mine after take off wanting to sleep. I was awake for breakfast and was offered the continental breakfast. The IFE on this plane is a little bit older as is most notciable on the flight path screen and the old remote, but still an excellent selection. The flight was 45 minutes ahead of schedule because of strong tail winds."
2017-01-08,8,8,"""heaven compared to other airlines""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding."
2017-01-07,8,8,"""it was a great flight""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Singapore. I was looking forward to fly the A350. After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews. The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level. Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that. Customer service was good (not exceptional) and the meals were delicious. One of the best meals ever had on a plane. I appreciate the metal cutlery and hot towel cloths. Overall, it was a great flight and I am looking forward to the next one! And I made my connection flight (which was very tight) thanks to the very efficient airport of Changi."
2017-01-06,9,9,"""polite, courteous and helpful""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Houston via Manchester. Flight left Singapore on time and cabin crew provided hot towel followed by drink and light supper after take off. FAs patrol the cabin with water, juice and snack runs every 15-30 minutes and very helpful when I requested additional drinks. They turned the lights back on and started the hot towel, drinks and Breakfast service before we arrived in Manchester. Flight deck communication was adequate; we know we were ahead of schedule and can expect that Manchester is foggy and cold when we arrived. Entertainment system was a slightly older one without touch screen but still contains more than enough movies, TV series and games to keep passengers entertained. The flight left Manchester behind schedule but arrived on time in Houston. Fresh set of crew got on board from Manchester going to Houston. There is one FA that we knew from our previous flight 2 weeks back between SIN-CGK; back then she mentioned she'll be in this flight and she was! She was one of the better crew members in our past flight and her bright and cheerful personality shines through in this flight as well. Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite, courteous and helpful as expected, but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected, but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight, keeping us full with three meal services and drink-snacks in between, also keeping the restrooms clean and well-stocked. Flight deck communications are adequate; we were informed about possible turbulences along the way so we can prepare, the time we will be arriving in Houston and also the local weather informations."
