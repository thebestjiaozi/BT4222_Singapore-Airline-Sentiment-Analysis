2025-10-29,8,8,“ only beverage offers”,"✅ Trip Verified | A lot of Junior Crew operating this full flight SQ128(10/28/2025). PTV still display the old safety video version. Multiple times trying the KrisWorld wifi connectivity, it doesn’t work and can’t pair the SQ mobile apps. No earpiece provided and since this is a short flight drinks are the only beverage offers. What surprised me is this is unusual experience without landing announcements made with long taxi to arrival gate. Chat with the Crew while disembarked and they acknowledged and laughing say they forgot."
2025-10-23,2,2,"""lost my luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve always considered Singapore Airlines one of the world’s leading carriers, but a recent experience has been profoundly disappointing. It has now been over 44 days since the airline lost my luggage, and I have yet to receive a proper response, follow-up, or a meaningful update. I’ve been met with vague, templated replies and no accountability. Each department passes the issue along, but no one resolves it."
2025-10-20,1,1,"“no available overhead""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ177. Booked in February. Checked in online 48 hours prior to flight. However showed up at the counter, and given a new seat. I tried to inquire why, but Agent didn’t speak English. Aboard Couldn’t have my personal effects, and no available overhead. Felt pretty terrible. Crew not willing to assist. SQ Regional not recommended."
2025-10-12,1,1,"""weighing it, declared it overweight""","✅ Trip Verified | This was the worst business-class flight I’ve taken. On the JFK–Singapore–Bangkok route, staff fixated on my carry-on — a Briggs & Riley bag. They insisted on weighing it, declared it overweight, and forced me to buy a replacement carry-on for $156.99 just to board. This same carry-on has flown on every airline I’ve used. The seat was another nightmare. Whoever designed that leg rest clearly never tried sleeping in it. It’s a minor complaint compared with the carry-on fiasco, but it shows how little thought went into this so-called premium experience. The SilverKris Lounge at Terminal 3 in Singapore was unimpressive, and the one in Terminal 2 was a joke."
2025-10-01,8,8,"“on the ground disaster, In the Air Gold!”","✅ Trip Verified | SQ186 SIN-SGN. SQ SIN Ground staff a disaster, just barely displaying connecting flights. No escort, no verification, and no radio calls to hold the gates, like before the Virus. Multiple passengers had T2 Onward Connections. Barely Arrived at Gate with friendly security. Once in, boarding commenced. Crew energetic, and polite. Still haven’t seen new safety video, yet had 3 flights with SQ in 5 days span. Took off, and served a meal. Multiple drink rounds performed, and arrived into SGN. Air Traffic Control Ground must have forgot about us, as it took 10+ minutes to moor at the gate. Captain did make an apology announcement, about it too. After 53 Minutes, cleared Immigration, and couldn’t find the luggage carousel. No SQ agents in sight. SQ on the ground disaster, In the Air Gold!"
2025-10-01,10,10,"""the crew was attentive and visible""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ325 FRA-SIN in Premium Economy. Check in opened early, with polite associate. Initially didn’t know how to read my Visa, for onward flight. Checked me in, and I proceeded to Security. Staff was walking around by the gate checking travel documents. Orderly Boarding commenced. Crew warm, and friendly. A380 Premium Economy seat comfortable. Pushed back late, and took off. Had the first meal, with multiple drink rounds. Throughout the flight crew was attentive, and visible. Second meal served. Arrived into Changi 25+ minutes late, with the aircraft parked quite a distance from the T3 Center."
2025-09-23,4,4,“food was rubbish”,"Not Verified |    While the cabin crew service was ok my food was rubbish. The first meal was a late dinner and the option I chose was not available on the meal trolley the crew member said she would get it from the galley kitchen and deliver it to me. This never happened. The next meal was breakfast. Both choices for this were terrible. Singapore Airlines is rated as one of the best, but this was certainly not the case on this flight."
2025-09-19,8,8,“didn’t receive a Welcome greeting”,"✅ Trip Verified | SQ25 JFK-FRA in Premium Economy. Check in opened early. Had a massive line, but staff were efficient and polite. JFK had a new security style. While boarding crew read my pass wrong, and seated me in Business. I didn’t receive a Welcome Aboard greeting. IFE still doesn’t have Old is Gold section. Round of Champagne came out, followed by dinner. No second round of drinks. Slept through breakfast, and 60 minutes out of FRA. No trash collected, and had to go to the galley to throw my trash. Arrived, and SQ agent announcements were inaudible. Upon getting to Baggage Claim, My Rimowa had its tag removed. Not sure how it arrived in FRA."
2025-09-09,1,1,"""they offered no compensation""","✅ Trip Verified | Their online customer service was horrible, and appears to be run by AI robots who sympathise, but don’t actually help at all. I booked 9 months ahead for my NZ-UK trip so that I got a nice cheap flight with short stopovers. 1.5 months out, Singapore airlines decided to cancel my middle flight, with no explanation as to why. I said ok book me on a new flight, they pointed fingers at the booking agent to fix it. And the booking agent told me there was a technical error on Singapore Air’s system, so they couldn’t do it for me. Both of them pointed fingers blaming the other one for a whole month. So I didn’t have a confirmed flight for over a month while I was just left waiting. Singapore airlines were the ones to finally fix it, but only when I threatened legal action at them. This was after a month of stress and calling both the booking agent and Singapore every day! They then rebooked me onto a much much longer flight that had huge stopovers, meaning I had to fork out for nights accommodation myself in Melbourne, and add an extra day to my travel, and the level of stress I faced was insane. And they offered no compensation for this. I had to fork out $168.80 for their mess up in accommodation, and the extra food. And they refuse to offer any form of compensation. I’ve asked repeatedly, and they say they can’t do anything. My in person service was lovely and can’t fault it. But their online team are honestly useless. All they say is “we understand your frustration, but can’t do anything”."
2025-09-04,1,1,"""luggage was left in Singapore""","✅ Trip Verified | I traveled from Australia to Madrid via Singapore on August 28 with a shared flight operated by Singapore Airlines and Air Europa. Due to a delay, my luggage was left in Singapore. It’s now day 8 and I still haven’t received it. Singapore Airlines blames Air Europa. Air Europa is disorganized and offers no real customer service. No updates, no plan, no accountability."
2025-08-26,5,5,"""A disappointing airline""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew yesterday from Singapore to Bangkok at around lunch time. The Aircraft was configured in a 3-3-3 pattern to have a total of 301 Seats in Economy Class. The problem was that for such a large Economy Class configuration , SIA provided only 6 toilets. Further the toilets were cramped, gloomy with barely any lighting. The Aircraft was clean - no more Newspapers, Economic Times Magazine , or Airline Mag. The Seats were comfortable. Audio device was provided a ear plugs. I had ordered AVML (Indian Veg Meal) & this came in 2 cardboard boxes. (One had some paneer curry with carrots on top & basamati rice biryani plain rice at the bottom luke warm) A half parotta (indian bread was provided with plain yougurt & sweet lime pickle. The other box had 3 small Rasmalia pieces in a sugary syrup. Drinks were served in paper cups & cutlery was wooden spoon & forks. My food was insipid bland & tasteless. The plane was about 75-80 % full and landed on time at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Baggage came undamaged in Bangkok. A disappointing airline"
2025-08-23,9,9,“Seats had generous pitch”,"✅ Trip Verified |    My connection in Changi was just over an hour, which meant power-walking through Terminal 3 like I was in a fitness ad, but I even managed to window-shop before heading to the gate. Boarding the A380 was the highlight, my first time on the superjumbo, and honestly I get the hype. Quiet, smooth, roomy, and with pillows and blankets already waiting on the seat, it felt like flying in a moving library. Turbulence near Taipei thanks to a hurricane reminded me we were still in the air, but otherwise it was ridiculously comfortable. Seats had generous pitch, adjustable (if slightly stiff) headrests, proper tray table design, cup holders, USB ports, and power outlets. The IFE had a bigger screen than the short-haul jets, and it was slick to use. WiFi was patchy, but that is more politics than technology when flying over certain countries. Meal was chicken egg noodles in honor of SG60, tasty enough to not need extra seasoning. Toilets definitely showed their age, but the crew were absolute stars, friendly and attentive. Bonus points for baggage arriving in Shanghai without drama, plus app tracking so I did not have to play “Will my bag make it?” roulette. If the A380 is a dying breed, I am glad I caught it while it still shines."
2025-08-23,10,10,"“Comfortable seat, friendly crew”","✅ Trip Verified |    An early morning flight usually means I am running on coffee fumes, but this one was smooth enough to feel like a gentle wake-up call. Check-in still required going to the counter (seriously, it is 2025… just let me generate the boarding pass on the app already), but at least the staff were efficient. Once onboard, the shiny A350 felt like a treat. Comfortable seat, friendly crew, pillows already waiting, and an inflight entertainment screen that actually worked quickly without lagging like an old smartphone. No tail camera, which was a pity, but the movie selection was solid. WiFi was complimentary for KrisFlyer members, though only good for messaging, so no video calls to brag midair. Power outlets and USB charging were available, meaning my phone landed happier than I did. The “snack” turned out to be a proper hot meal: a delicious bowl of mie ayam, filling to both stomach and soul. Arrival into Terminal 3 made the connection an easy stroll. A great start to the day, even if technology still refuses to replace the check-in counter."
2025-08-23,10,10,“fan of this aircraft”,"✅ Trip Verified |    The final leg felt like a nice epilogue to the trip. Another A350, and I am quickly becoming a fan of this aircraft. I had a window seat, which always feels like a win, and once again pillows and blankets were already placed on each seat. The plane looked like a long-haul setup, with a different business class cabin and even premium economy tucked in, so it felt a little more “fancy” than your usual short hop. Power outlet under the seat, responsive IFE system, all the essentials in place. This time, instead of movies, I scrolled through the audio section and let nature sounds help me nap, because why not listen to waves crashing while you are 30,000 feet above the Java Sea. Breakfast options were fried carrot cake or omelet, and I went with the omelet and apple juice, simple and satisfying after a long night of travel. The crew were, as always, attentive without being overbearing. Best of all, no disruptive passengers in sight. A short, calm, and restful way to close the journey, and proof that not every flight story needs drama."
2025-08-23,8,8,“not bad at all”,"✅ Trip Verified |    Dropping off baggage at Pudong station there were counters open, long line, lots of sighing, but at least the ground staff were polite. The red-eye back was on a 787-10, another first for me, and I liked the layout. Proper seat pockets instead of flimsy nets, USB and power at each seat, pillows and blankets already waiting, and an IFE system that actually responded when you tapped it. I barely used it though, since I was more focused on sleep. Dinner was twice-cooked pork, a little bland but improved with a glass of white wine. Toilets were conveniently mid-cabin, which helped since I was half-asleep most of the flight. The crew handled everything gracefully, including a fellow passenger who ordered a bland meal then complained it was not vegetarian, and spent the rest of the flight blinding people with their flashlight. Not the crew’s fault, but I had secondhand embarrassment on their behalf. Arrival in Singapore was smooth, and I even had time for shopping and a quick stop before security. For a red-eye, this one was not bad at all, flashlight warriors aside."
2025-08-23,7,7,“ complaint requesting compensation”,"✅ Trip Verified |    In response to the delayed departure of Scoot’s flight in Bangkok, which resulted in a more than three-hour delay and the subsequent missed connection to Johannesburg, I was rerouted to Amsterdam (economy plus) and then I was put on a KLM flight to Cape Town (economy only). I lodged a formal complaint requesting compensation. However, my request was met with a simple letter expressing gratitude for my patience. I find that this is inacceptable as they could have put me on a later flight from SIN to JNB/CPT saving me the additional 11 hours flight and the transit time in Amsterdam. While I am disappointed with the inadequate response, I must acknowledge that the economy premium offered by Singapore Airlines was satisfactory. In my opinion, their economy premiumis superior to comparable options provided by other airlines, as the seats are significantly more comfortable. The food quality was acceptable, although the wine selection was limited. Service was standard, nothing to write home about but the entertainment options on Singapore Airlines were highly enjoyable. Given the horrendous connection offered and the equally unsatisfying response, I will not fly SQ again"
2025-08-16,1,1,“missed my connection”,✅ Trip Verified |    I flew from SYD to the UK and return in May 2025. The LGW to SIN flight was delayed and I missed my connection to SYD. I was put on a later flight and downgraded to economy. I accept delays happen but I do not accept that Singapore Airlines take 3 months to make a simple fare adjustment and refund to me. I paid $5822.00 for this flight on 8 November 2024 - the fare adjustment/refund of $229.00 for the SIN to SYD sector is disproportionate and an insult. The service to me on board was shoddy and my food was poor. A year earlier I flew SYD/LHR/SYD on JAL - a vastly superior experience.
2025-08-12,4,4,"""served in a plastic cup""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve always admired Singapore Airlines for its attention to detail and exceptional service, which is why I booked them for my recent flight from San Francisco to Singapore in Premium economy. I was quite surprised when I ordered a whiskey and it was served in a plastic cup. For the price of the ticket, I expected proper glasswar. It might seem like a small detail, but these details are what truly define a premium travel experience. Everything else about the journey — the professionalism of the crew, the comfort of the cabin, and the on-time performance — met the high standards I’ve come to expect. But this one detail felt inconsistent with the Singapore Airlines experience I’ve always valued."
2025-08-04,2,2,"""standard has dropped""",✅ Trip Verified | The cabin service and food served to me on this flight was horrendous. Cabin crew service no longer had the warmth that they used to be known for. Singapore Airlines' standard has dropped drastically.
2025-07-30,10,10,“Staff polite and courteous”,"✅ Trip Verified | SQ177 in Economy. Check in at SGN fast. Staff polite, and courteous. They acknowledged I checked in Online, checked my Bag through, instructed me to watch my Bag go through security, and thanked me. Proceed to the gate. We had a Gate Change, and the announcement was clear. However when boarding commenced, Announcements were not clear, and extremely difficult. Volume was low, or speakers were out of service. Boarded, with a friendly, warm crew welcoming us aboard. Overhead storage not available, so had to use 3 rows ahead of me. Pushed back, and got on the Runway. Seem to sit for a while, ready for take. Took off, and right into Turbulence, so limited services. Eventually served a Meal, and Drink. I had the Fish, and Potatoes. As the Captain announced descend, Crew expeditiously coming around to collect Trays, and Trash. Smooth landing, and arrived into Changi T3, with the friendly crew wishing me well."
2025-07-22,10,10,"""experience was very positive""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Rome with stop in Singapore with wife and infant (almost 2 years old). Overall the experience was very positive. You can choose seat and meal option at booking time, so you won't have to worry about it before your journey. We chose the seats with bassinet support, which are spacious. They delivered food earlier for us, and they have proper infant meal which includes milk and a solid option. + Entertainment options are decent. They also provided a gift to the baby and free stroller delivery. Overall I would retake this airline without a doubt."
2025-07-14,2,2,“Not worth the money”,Not Verified | Flight delayed with technical fault meaning missed connector to London. Seat in Premium Economy was also broken with token voucher offered. Seats are old and very unsupportive and still cramped for me and I’m not even 6ft. Not worth the money.
2025-07-02,8,8,"""would fly them again to Australia""","✅ Trip Verified | ADL-SIN, on Boeing 787-10. ADL check in was chaotic. Lots of people standing around, not flying with SQ, getting in the way. Upon getting to the automated machine, SQ agent appeared. I explained to him, I’m going to a Visa required country. He listened, and excused himself to process my ticket. Upon coming back, he thanked me for waiting, and assisted me tagging my bag. I then dropped it off, and proceed to Immigration. Boarding was done professionally. Upon boarding, friendly crew member assisted me with my Carry On. Took off on time. Cabin crew professional, but nothing special. They dimmed the lights so we could sleep, and I managed to doze off for over 2 hours. SQ has a fixed back seat, but unlike the A380, much more comfortable. Landed Changi T3, and received friendly onward well wishes from the crew. Have taken SQ 4x to Australia, and would fly them again to Australia."
2025-07-01,1,1,“should bear the responsibility”,"✅ Trip Verified | My flight from Singapore to Denpasar (DPS) was cancelled due to a volcanic eruption. While I understand that such events are extraordinary circumstances, several other international airlines continued their operations to Bali on the same day. Singapore Airlines decision to cancel the flight, while other carriers deemed it safe to fly, appears to be a subjective one. Singapore Airlines should bear the responsibility for the financial losses I incurred, including the non-refundable costs for my pre-booked hotel and activities in Bali, which were forfeited. However, it refused to do so. On top of that, the lack of timely and adequate communication from Singapore Airlines is appalling. I was only informed of the flight cancellation after arriving in Singapore for my transit. Had I been notified while still in Tokyo, I could have remained there or explored alternative travel arrangements with other airlines. Instead, I was stranded in a transit city with no prior warning and extremely limited options. As a direct result, I was forced to secure and pay for my own lodging in Singapore. To make matters worse, upon the arrival in Singapore, I was met with a chaotic and disorganized baggage claim process, resulting in a 12 hour wait for my luggage. Singapore airline offered no assistance whatsoever in arranging overnight accommodation and I was left to fend for myself. After I filed a complaint to Singapore Airline, I got a email asking about my lost luggage in Bali instead of addressing the issues that I mentioned above. The funny thing is, my luggage was delayed in Singapore, not in Bali. Their staff has not only failed to identify the issue, but also outsourced their customer support complaints to a different team instead of contacting me directly. Singapore Airlines is consistently ranked among the world's top airlines, a reputation that suggests a commitment to exceptional customer service. My recent experience, however, paints a starkly different picture – one of operational disarray, poor communication, and a disregard for passenger welfare."
2025-06-30,8,8,"""was greeted at my seat""","✅ Trip Verified | Less than 2 Hours to board, flight appeared on the Information Screens. Security at Changi quick, and professional. Announcements were made, however they were inaudible, and I didn’t know what was happening. Apparently aircraft arrived late from BKK. Boarding commenced, in an orderly fashion. Aboard only greeted at the entry. Walked through the aircraft and was greeted at my seat. First time on the Boeing 787-10. Seat was fixed back, but comfortable. Pushed back, and headed out. They kept the lights full blast, and couldn’t sleep. We got served a snack, and then they dimmed the lights. Took forever to fall asleep. Woke up to a meal being served. Multiple rounds of coffee served, and felt adjusted. Landed at ADL, with SQ Staff not visible, to help find the luggage carousel."
2025-06-25,8,8,"""in the air still Gold Service""","✅ Trip Verified | Booked in January, and no solo seat available. Received information from SQ, that flight time was going to be early, due to a Heatwave on US. Coast. Arrived at check in, and agent wouldn’t check my Bag, or issue ticket for final destination. I was stumped as I had done the exact same thing, on the exact same route before. After going back and forth, she transferred me to a manager, however again he would not check me, and my bag, to my onward destination. Upon passing Security, I ran into the Head SQ Agent, and complained to her. She listened, took note of me, via my Boarding Pass, and politely told me she was going to look into it. After 60 minutes she came back, with my Luggage checked in to my onward destination, and told me I would be issued a ticket as well. Onboard crew friendly, warm, and welcoming. Took off on time, yet throughout the flight Turbulence affected all services. For Lunch they had an option, previously they haven’t. I had the Braised Chicken. Constant refills commenced, and attentive crew. IFE was a disaster, with nothing decent. Throughout the flight, drinks available, but unlike ANA no drink bar style, and you had to wait for the crew to serve you. Had the second meal, and again options, with excellent service. Arrived into a quiet Changi T3, and commenced layover. Since the Virus, SQ on the ground is a disaster, in the air still Gold Service."
2025-06-23,2,2,"""mediocre at best""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew in business class and it was mediocre at best. It did not seem like full flat seats, staff was inattentive to me, I had to ask for everything and my food was inedible."
2025-06-08,5,5,"""miles haven't been credited""","✅ Trip Verified | As a KrisFlyer Elite Silver member, I made several bookings through KrisFlyer Vroom on November 10, 2024, and processed a refund on December 21, 2024. However, it's been nearly six months, and my miles (481,292) still haven't been credited to my account despite multiple follow-ups from the airline. This experience is disappointing, especially from an airline that claims to prioritize customer focus but appears unresponsive. The situation feels unfair and raises concerns about Singapore Airlines' reliability and trustworthiness, despite its reputation for quality service."
2025-05-31,3,3,“Refused a bottle of water”,"Not Verified | Refused a bottle of water in the beginning of the fight. SQ CS confirmed me that only FC Premium economy class can have a bottle of water. Economy class only being served a cup of water. When requested a Singapore sling and you cannot have a can of beer at the same time, what’s the point of buying a SQ ticket which is more expensive than other airlines and downgrade the inflight service. Hot towel has no perfume as it was in the past year 1993. SQ food is also not delicious from SIN to CDG flight, fried fish with maizena buttery - not delicious at all."
2025-05-21,9,9,"""seat was very comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified |   Check-in and baggage drop at Cape Town were very easy and smooth. The Bidvest Premier lounge was very comfortable, with a good selection of breakfast fare. On both legs of this journey boarding was efficient and the welcome very friendly. Onboard service could not be faulted. The seat was very comfortable in sitting position, with plenty of storage, but manually activating the flatbed and sleeping diagonally detracted a bit from the experience. The vegetarian food and drink were generally good, but on two occasions very dry and rubbery vegetable wraps were served. On the first flight passengers were required to remain seated while the aircraft was serviced during a 70-minute stop at Johannesburg. Both flights operated slightly early. During the lay-over in Singapore we had a very comfortable wait in the Silver Kris lounge, and then went quickly through security at the gate. Our luggage was delivered quickly (but the Melbourne Airport customs chaos was a different story)."
2025-05-17,10,10,"""My sincere appreciation""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Kolkata. My sincere appreciation to all the crew in the flight who were serving economy class. All the crew were very courteous from boarding to in flight service to de boarding. I am vegetarian and opted for vegetarian meal. Selection of array of dishes and there taste was delightful. Free in flight wifi is amazing.
2025-05-12,2,2,"""disappointing experience""","✅ Trip Verified |   I had a disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines during my recent trip from Delhi to Denpasar via Singapore. Despite requesting special assistance well in advance, confirming it through emails and at check-in, no assistance was provided at Changi Airport during the transit period. The staff later claimed that my assistance request was only recorded for the final arrival at Delhi, not for the transit at Singapore, which is when it was needed."
2025-05-08,1,1,"""lack of supervision on customer-service""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight of SQ from LHR-SIN, SIN-PEN + return leg was smooth and was treated with respectable service. However, the same cannot be said of their customer service online, both email and chatbox. Prior to my trip, I had problems activating my KrisFlyer account as it was idle/inactive for a few years. First contact to customer service was done on 18-Jan-2025. I was unable to login to my old account, and also unable create a new Krisflyer account using a new email address due to a system error. Despite following up on 22-Jan, 3-Feb, 7-Feb, there was no reply and there has been no reply to date; 08-May-2025 after almost 4.5 months. With disappointment of SQ's customer service and feeling unwelcomed, I did my booking of LHR-PEN with another airlines frequent miles program. However, the miles points were not credited although it was clearly written in my eticket. My attempt to claim the missing miles was complicated as I have not kept the boarding pass. My attempt to again reach SQ chat customer service was another disappointment. Both these encounters with customer service tells me that there is lack of supervision on customer-service ticketing conclusion and success rate. This is disappointing for an airline that is reputable for in-person service. The same level of detail needs to be done on online service."
2025-05-03,1,1,"""Very poor customer service""","Not Verified | Very poor customer service. On the outbound flight I was allowed to take a power bank but was told that the rules would change whilst I was away and I’d need permission to bring it back. I spent hours over the couple of weeks, trying to get this permission, which never came. The website contained no useful information to suggest that my powerbank was not allowed, customer services were slow to reply, and when they did the response came from a different person each time and did not answer my question, it was impossible to find an email address on the website, and it took me round in circles continuously. The online form could not be submitted from my phone (despite trying several times over several days, only sending when I eventually had a chance to get onto a laptop. Because of the slow and unhelpful responses, in the end I had to leave the power bank behind in Singapore. Since my return, the airline has been equally useless and has absolved itself of all responsibility. Exceptionally poor."
2025-04-25,6,6,""" there’s little room between each row""","✅ Trip Verified | In October 2024 I flew with Singapore Airlines return from Sydney to Phnom Phen and the flights between Singapore and Cambodia were on their new 737-MAX 8. It was my first opportunity to experience their regional business class and from row 2 - their much talked about throne seat. Despite the flight time, Male is another destination in their regional network, only this time it was a 787-10 Dreamliner. Given this is a widebody aircraft, the business class seating is 1x2x1 with the single seats on either side staggered – the front row seat is against the aisle followed by a seat against the window. I usually pre-order my meals using their ‘book the cook’ service but forgot on this occasion. That proved to be a big mistake because what arrived was so underwhelming I can’t even remember what it was. But I know I tried it and then handed the tray and everything on it back to a flight attendant and chose to sleep instead. The seat converts into a lay flat bed which was quite comfortable given there’s no bedding provided other than a blanket and pillow. But the footwell is much more accommodating than the 737 throne seat. However, there’s little room between each row, so business class is tightly packed and on a full flight like mine the cabin is no a haven in the sky. Despite that, I managed to get about 2 hours of much needed sleep. Then on arrival, the rather expensive bottle of champagne I purchased on board was seized. I was unaware that you require a license to bring any alcohol into the country; even if it’s just 1 bottle. It would have been nice if the crew said something before, they processed the sale. Did the flight experience live up to my expectations? – I would have to say no. Sure the aircraft was fairly new, but then it’s hard to guess the age of their planes from the inside. I should rate this experience as 5 out of 10 because Singapore Airlines can do much better and usually do. But I’m feeling generous so I’ll give them 6"
2025-04-25,1,1,"""found my seat area dirty""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew Business Class on SQ612 from Singapore to Incheon on 9 April 2025, and the experience fell short of what one would expect from a premium airline like Singapore Airlines. Upon boarding, I found my seat area dirty. I raised the issue and submitted photographic evidence, expecting it to be taken seriously. The initial response was a generic apology, and after pushing for escalation, I was offered a SGD100 KrisShop voucher, an insultingly small gesture. This isn’t just about cleanliness; it’s about how customer concerns are handled."
2025-04-19,9,9,"""one of the best airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | There can be no doubt, Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world. From the moment you step on board you are greeted a team of people and each one acknowledges you and you always see a smile. A flight attendant came and introduced herself to me saying she was responsible for taking care of me for this flight and to let her know if I there was anything I needed. I had taken advantage of their ‘book the cook’ service and chosen my meal in advance. But I couldn’t remember what it was I ordered, and was reassure if I changed my mind that wasn’t a problem I was free to choose anything for the flight menu. While the method of changing the chair to a bed on their 777 is unconventional, it’s damn comfortable and easy to get a few hours sleep. The pillows and bedding are a real treat. I find that Singapore Airlines flight attendants have an ability to match the level of service to an individual passenger’s needs. The bathrooms are always clean, and you can enter without fear of what might await you. I wish the airline would provide business class passengers with sleeper suits as other airlines do. On this, they are at a competitive disadvantage. I take my own (typically one from Qatar Airways) and it doesn’t do Singapore Airlines any good to have a passenger walking around in clothing blazoned with a competitor’s logo."
2025-04-18,6,6,"""terribly designed business class seat""",✅ Trip Verified |   London to Singapore business class on the A380-800. Marking this rating down due to a fatal flaw in the terribly designed business class seat which is truly awful if you want to try to sleep! While it’s a flat bed you are forced to sleep diagonally with very narrow footwells so that if yiu want to change position to lie on your side then your otherside it’s impossible! It’s to restrictive to move so you’ll hardly get any decent sleep unless you have consumed large amounts of alcohol from the great choice on the wine list…whoever designed this seat needs to be fired! Apparently talking to one flight attendant they did say there’s a refit of new seats & interior on this aircraft planned but wasn’t sure when. Cabin Crew were fabulous as you’d expect in serving our needs & was nice to engage in conversation with a couple of them which was very welcoming indeed. Food was superb & every dish we had was delicious & drink choices again excellent. Forget the WiFi as it’s doesn’t work so save your money & getting frustrated. IFE was good quick responsive touch screen & easy to navigate. Definitely recommend this airline but at this time avoid the A380-800 business class seat if you think you’ll get a good nights sleep & opt for there 350 or 777 aircraft.
2025-04-18,6,6,"""very mixed experience""","✅ Trip Verified |   Flew on SQ228; very mixed experience. The cabin crew were extremely good, and efficient. The food however was not up to standard. My wife and myself had diffent meals and we both thought it was poor. Also l am not a fan of the seat configuration. The storage areas are really good, however unless you are lying completely flat you are forced to sit on an uncomfortable angle to stretch your legs out."
2025-04-17,9,9,"""remains a reliable choice""","Not Verified | I recently flew on Singapore Airlines from Hong Kong to Singapore, and the experience was largely pleasant, reaffirming the airline’s reputation. Check-in at HKG was smooth, with efficient staff and minimal queues. Boarding was well-organized, adhering to priority groups, though the process felt slightly rushed due to a tight schedule. The A350-900 was clean and modern, with comfortable economy seats offering decent legroom. The cabin crew was attentive and polite, providing warm service throughout the flight. Noise levels were low, contributing to a relaxing journey. KrisWorld’s entertainment system had a great selection of movies and music. However, the touchscreen was occasionally sluggish. Meal service was a highlight, I opted for the seafood pasta, which was flavorful and well-presented. A small snack and beverages were also served, with a good variety of options. The flight departed on time and arrived early, which was impressive. Turbulence was minimal, and the captain provided clear updates. The only downside was the slightly cramped seating, which is typical for economy class on long-haul configured aircraft. While the seat space could be better, Singapore Airlines remains a reliable choice for this route. Would fly again for the service and punctuality!"
2025-04-17,9,9,"""experience was very enjoyable""","✅ Trip Verified | Once I arrived at the check-in counter, a friendly smile greeted us. When I boarded the plane, I found that it was an old plane, but things inside were excellent. For instance, the seat was a bit narrow but I could comfortably sit. Cabin crew were polite. The food was delicious and a variety of drinks to choose from. There was not many movies to watch I linked to the WiFi. The experience was very enjoyable."
2025-04-10,9,9,“It all came to an end too quickly”,"✅ Trip Verified | Having last flown Singapore Airlines more than two decades ago, I was enthusiastic to fly again in their A350, albeit a short flight from Bangkok to Singapore. It began with a speedy Business Class check-in, with instructions to follow the signs to the SilverKris Lounge. Through Fast Track security, I headed towards the Gate 7 area, which was a fairly lengthy walk. Boarding was efficient. The first thing that impressed me was the gorgeous look of the cabin. It appeared in pristine condition. The cabin colour scheme of shades of mauve and light bluey-purple looked impeccable. Laid out in a 1x2x1 arrangement, this was a long-haul seating aircraft, operating on short-haul regional flights (sadly in Europe we have to contend with an 18-inch wide seat and 30-inch pitch, and no IFE). All the essential features of flatbed seating on this A350 were there. The seat functions on the side of the seat worked smoothly and effortlessly. A large pillow and blanket were placed on the seat. And on the side, was a small locker containing USB and power points, along with a menu and headphones. The pull-out mirror was a nice touch too. Preflight soft drinks came around, and requesting champagne, it was promptly served soon after. Just before pushback, hot towels were provided, and the safety video began with instructions to put on the 3-point seat belt (which has the shoulder strap). Once at cruising height, the breakfast service began. Being a short duration flight, the meal was served on a single tray. I was addressed by my name, and so opted for the Seafood Pad Thai, which came with prawns, scallops and fish cake - absolutely delicious. Without requesting, I was served with more champagne, followed by coffee. The touch-screen IFE worked well, and I noted a good selection of some of the very latest movies. I assumed that this was the same on all flights, as it wouldn't be possible to watch a 2-hour movie on a 2-hour flight. The headphones were a tad heavy and did not feel too comfortable. Overall, although the crew were non-engaging (short flight), the service was friendly and carried out with precision. It all came to an end too quickly, and I hope my next flight with Singapore Airlines will be a 'proper' long haul."
2025-04-08,7,7,"""below average pitch and recline""","✅ Trip Verified | Check in at Istanbul airport very fast and friendly with nine check in counters in operation. Boarding well organized. Both flights were on the quiet A359. Food and service on both flights decent, IFE ok, and WiFi rather mediocre. The seats are tight with a below average pitch and recline. Both flights on time."
2025-04-06,5,5,"""no dining on demand""","Not Verified | Changi Airport looking dated, but the SQ lounge was outstanding. Big working areas, excellent shower facilities, nice bar, plenty of good tasting food, spotlessly clean, good atmosphere. The business class seat lounging and sleeping positions are not comfortable, and the seat’s controls did not work quickly. Difficult to use power outlets, complicated storage areas, sleeping in a diagonal position with very small foothole. The IFE feels old with limited choice. No live TV. Worst deterioration when compared to their past offering, was the food & beverages. Limited choice, main course tasted bland, and premium drinks served in small soda-type glasses, no dining on demand. Luckily the complimentary wifi worked well."
2025-04-02,2,2,"""the screen of my seat was not working""","✅ Trip Verified | Brisbane to Singapore on flight SQ256. I had a bad experience during this flight. Because the screen of my seat was not working I informed the staff. He told me that there was nothing that could be done. He told me to share the screen with the person sitting next to me. How ridiculous! The unpleasant experience didn't end there. When it was time for the meal service, I was told that the food I ordered was no longer available. The staff said that there was only one option left. I expect better service and solutions from an airline, regardless of whether I'm flying business or economy class. We pay for the service, and it's reasonable to expect a certain level of quality and professionalism"
2025-03-20,7,7,"""average in terms of comfort""","✅ Trip Verified |   Checkin at BKK very slow with a long line of passengers. It took me over an hour to reach the checkin counter. The station manager came, shrugged her shoulders and left. Flight itself on time and uneventful, food decent, although lukewarm. The long 13 hours flight was on the mighty and quiet A380. Flight left on time and arrived about an hour earlier than scheduled. Food was ok, but nothing to shout about. IFE and complimentary WiFi was very good. Seats average in terms of comfort and legroom."
2025-03-19,10,10,“Always excellent service”,"Not Verified | Excellent services as usual by Singapore Airlines from Darwin to Singapore on 13 March 2025, even though I was fasting and unable to eat my foods they didn’t forget to give me a box of dry foods and drinks to break my fasting. Thanks a lot to the cabin crews. Flight from Singapore to BKK SQ710 on 14 March was great too. Always excellent service."
2025-02-23,9,9,"""Everything is premium""","Not Verified | I recently flew in Singapore airlines. Everything about the airline is premium. Check in experience, the gate allotted to them, time performance, crew. Flying in A380 was itself unique experience. Seating comfort could have been better though, otherwise it's a 10 out of 10."
2025-02-05,2,2,“disappointed on this trip”,"Not Verified | Pretty disappointed on this trip on SQ. Initially from Seattle the entertainment system was not working for over an hour. Wifi on board even after I logged in with my Kris flyer ac could not connect. Flight attendant did try to help but she could not figure out. 2nd flight, SQ510 from SIN to BLR delayed over an 1 hour 45 mins.Just a series of frustrating experiences on SQ this time as I have traveled at least 4 to 5 times in last few years. Lots of my friends suggested Qatar which probably will be my next choice."
2025-02-05,10,10,"""best airline I've traveled with""","✅ Trip Verified | This airline is world class and knows how to treat it's customers with professionalism and respect. Hands down, the best airline I've traveled with, (and I've traveled a lot). If their standards remain top notch, I'll be a customer for life."
2025-02-04,1,1,"“We didn’t ask for much""",✅ Trip Verified | It was our honeymoon and this airline couldn’t care less. We didn’t ask for much but the rudeness of their online staff really took away from the experience. Very disappointing approach from what I thought was a reputable organisation.
2025-01-30,6,6,"""All I got were apologies""","✅ Trip Verified | I did the automatic 48-hr online check-in. We arrived at LHR Terminal 2 early at around 0615, and our flight was scheduled 0910 (LHR- SIN-MNL). Upon arrival in the departure area, we found out, through airport personnel that our flight is delayed due to late arrival of the incoming plane. Very tired we were instructed to join a long queue and stood there for about 30 minutes, just near the gate of the Term 2. Few minutes later, we were instructed (again) to join another queue and stood there for another 20 minutes. To make the story short, we boarded the late aircraft. Adding to the bad experience, my paid seat did not adjust but stuck to its upright position. Singapore Airlines is a great airline. I used them before. I flew with them last Oct 2024 on same route. All I got were apologies. I am sad but surely I will try to avoid SA in future."
2025-01-28,6,6,"""thoughtful, polite and lovely stewardess""","✅ Trip Verified | It makes my day to be served by caring, thoughtful, polite and lovely stewardess that hard to come by as far as SQ is concerned serving own homeland. A great applaud to Natalie. For the moment we step into the plane and settle down, this lady greet us with broad smile. I am so grateful of her coming to my rescue to help me ease my gastric by going the extra mile to get me biscuits and hot drinks when they are busy out of their normal routine and SOP. Caring enough to come by to check on me that Im well. When we ask for drinks that help to soothe my daughter vomiting, other staff just cant help and said they cant do anything. Here come our hero Natalie, whom with her sincere thoughtfulness and care to fetch my daughter a hot peppermint tea which is not serve in economy class. Hopefully, the next round, I will meet her again . She deserve to be the one wearing green uniform . Well done Natalie! You are a role model for rest to follow."
2025-01-19,6,6,"""The product has changed""",✅ Trip Verified | My first time on SQ since before the pandemic and was looking forward to it. The product has changed however and not for the better. The meal has no menu (WiFi version didn’t work) and there are no branded products on the tray. Alcohol is available but only on request. Drinks are served without snacks or a napkin. Mid flight snacks are available. IFE is poor compared to other premium carriers. Crew were immaculate and excellent as always. Good VFM ticket too.
2025-01-06,5,5,"""did everything to support me after that""",✅ Trip Verified | I want to acknowledge the excellent service and hard work of the flying crew who are amongst the best that I have flown with. However as a wheel chair passenger I have to flag the fact that whereas Malpensa Airport ground assistance was excellent at Changi airport for the second year in a row I was dumped outside the boarding gate by the ground assistance staff and left to flag down a passing attendant to get help to get into the boarding gate. Assistance had been requested on all sectors to the plane entrance. The guy who dropped me off outside the gate said he would contact staff to help me to the plane which he either never did or they failed to respond. Subsequent confusion and physical stress at the security check in despite a visible tag indicating my assistance required status. The ticket officer was not very understanding and seemed to imply that there was no problem since I had made it. The cabin crew supervisor did everything to support me after that and as I said I have no complaints about the quality of the flight staff and their service on board on both sectors.
2024-12-30,10,10,“Outstanding service”,"✅ Trip Verified | Outstanding service from the cabin crew, who made passengers feel welcome with every interaction throughout the flight. They have been very well trained in hospitality. Food and beverages were plentiful and tasty, and passengers were free to get snacks from the galley (even in economy class) in between the 2 main meals served. The range of options for movies was impressive. I would go out of my way to choose this airline in the future, even if it meant paying more compared to a competitor."
2024-12-30,4,4,"""prioritizing paid seat selection""",✅ Trip Verified | I took a SIA flight from SG to Hanoi with my wife and Son on the 15 Dec. It was very disappointing that we found out that my son was seated few rows behind us when there are 4 empty seats in front of me and my wife. It happened again on our return trip SIA is prioritizing paid seat selection. I don't think I will fly with SIA anymore
2024-12-22,10,10,"""Perfect service from the cabin crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Perfect service from the cabin crew, even in economy class. With a full flight they still managed to maintain a high standard of attentiveness. Ample food provided. WiFi didn’t work for the full duration of the flight however."
2024-12-09,10,10,"“Truly service, elevated”","✅ Trip Verified | Truly service, elevated. Almost every step of the way, the customer and service were at the forefront. I won't comment much about the food, but it was acceptable. Cleanliness was also prioritised. The real gems are the well trained crew all around. From ticketing to ground to sky. For such a huge airline there are bound to be misses but most are above average and class leading, and this is something other airlines would struggle to achieve. Well done and they deserve all the accommodates for the work the management has put into making the airlines experience an elevated one."
2024-12-04,6,6,"""did not exceed my expectation""",✅ Trip Verified | My first time with Singapore Airlines did not exceed my expectation. The aircraft they use on our flight from Auckland is old. The lavatory was not well maintained. Some of the cabin crew are also disappointing.
2024-11-27,10,10,"""Cabin crew were so attentive""","✅ Trip Verified |   Singapore Airlines did a great job on a very full flight. Cabin crew were so attentive. Constantly coming up and down to offer drinks etc. Even a hot towel half-way through. I often fly with Qatar and there’s very little to choose between the two. They are without a doubt the two best airlines in the world, a significant level higher than the rest of the pack."
2024-11-20,2,2,"""not easily able to access the bathroom""","✅ Trip Verified | My daughter and I flew Singapore Airlines on our trip to Khao Lak in Thailand. We decided to go for what we thought was a reputable airline so we could have an enjoyable journey. We booked early and selected our seats, as we both had mild anxiety and medical conditions which necessitated a seat near the bathrooms. On our return flight there was a delay with flights which resulted in missing our flight from Singapore to Melbourne. We were placed on the next available flight, which was about 3 hours later. There were about 60 people in the same situation I was told, so there was a lot of chaos in getting new boarding passes, etc. We had no say in the seats which we placed in and of course they ended up being in the middle seat of the middle aisle. My daughter was extremely stressed as she was placed between two elderly people with mobility issues, and was not easily able to access the bathroom. The flight was initially very hot until they eventually managed to adjust the air conditioning. We were entitled to have an evening meal, but the only food we received was a pizza slice and breakfast. We ended up paying for a service which we didn't receive. I did write to Singapore Airlines and received the usual spiel about caring about customers"
2024-11-15,10,10,"""a pleasure to fly with""","✅ Trip Verified | A pleasure to fly with Singapore Airlines. Newer airplanes, best services, perfect entertainment system with plenty of choices, newest cabin. Flight crew the most professional and adorable."
2024-11-09,10,10,"""in-flight service was top-notch""","Not Verified | The best airline I have ever traveled with. The entire experience was fantastic. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, and the flight was smooth and comfortable. The plane was clean and well-maintained, and the in-flight service was top-notch. I have no complaints, only great memories."
2024-10-31,1,1,"""might receive complaints from other passengers""",✅ Trip Verified | 2 adults and 1 toddler travelling. We redeemed 2 business ticket via miles for wife and kid at full adult cost and an adult economy due to limited seats available. My spouse is heavily pregnant. They wouldn't even let me sit with my 2.5 year old to help my family though I clearly explained that I wouldn't need any business class meal or service. The flight staff's excuse was that they might receive complaints from other passengers.
2024-10-30,3,3,"""Only two meals served""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline food service. Only two meals served in a 17 hour flight and no snacks in between. For the second meal they ran out of vegetarian meal and only offered fruit. And when I expressed disappointment, they gave me a vegetarian meal. Secondly, they played an elevator music for one full hour during landing."
2024-10-11,10,10,"""one of our most enjoyable flights""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew Singapore Air;ine (SIA) for the first time. The checkin and boarding was very smooth. The seat was quite large and comfortable. The cabin crew were very nice and friendly. The food on BKK-Singapore route was quite tasty and on Singapore -Seoul route was excellent. They provided Free WiFi on both route wghich make us very happy. The entertainment (Movie, TV and Music) was great. This was one of our most enjoyable flights."
2024-10-05,10,10,"""Excellent for economy""","✅ Trip Verified | Excellent for economy. Five hours into flight and the seat was still comfortable - soft and firm in the right spots. The breakfast was good for economy. Large enough portions. Taste enough with variation on the tray to add interest. Cabin staff outstanding. Friendly and attentive. Quality tv screen. Easy to operate with a wide variety of programs. My transmitter that enables my wireless headphones to connect, doesn't always work on left and right. No problems on this flight. Power outlets for mains and USB. The best boarding process I have used, why don't all airlines do this? After showing boarding pass and entering the gate lounge, we were seated in boarding groups. Then each seated are group was called up in turn. Much more efficient than calling out the number of the boarding group and hoping every one has heard and no one tries to queue jump."
2024-10-02,1,1,"""dismissive and unapologetic tone""","✅ Trip Verified | My sister made an error in the booking, and I called the airline to see if I could change the return destination. After providing the necessary booking details for verification, the representative asked for the email associated with the ticket. When I explained that I couldn’t find it, the response I received was surprisingly abrupt and unprofessional: ""That’s not my question."" The tone was far from what one would expect from a customer service agent tasked with assisting passengers. The conversation continued with the agent asking if I was authorized to make changes to the booking. I explained that my sister had asked me to call, and I was met with an impatient demand for a ""YES or NO"" answer, with no effort to seek proof or confirmation of my authorization. Once I responded affirmatively, I was informed that the ticket could not be changed from the original destination, and no alternative options or further assistance were offered. The interaction left me with the distinct impression that providing help or exploring solutions was not a priority. The dismissive and unapologetic tone from the representative was disheartening, especially considering the airline’s reputation for excellence. I understand that policies around ticket changes are firm, but the lack of courtesy and helpfulness in communicating this was disappointing. It’s unfortunate to see a disconnect between the airline's esteemed reputation and the actual service provided."
2024-09-18,10,10,“Moon Festival Treats were a nice touch”,"✅ Trip Verified | SQ22 Solo Seat. Boards on Changi didn’t have the flight listed for awhile. Had to wait. Made it to the gate, which opened on time. Boarding commenced. Crew friendly, and warm. No bottled water in the water holder. Took off on time. Fell asleep when the First meal came out, and crew woke me up. Noticed they had put my window shades down. Champagne was served in a Glass. They ran out of food, and I had to have the Shrimp option. Was good, and the Moon Festival Treats were a nice touch. No second round of drinks. One Lavatory was a disaster and a broken sink. Second meal came out, this time Champagne was in a Plastic Cup. Snacks, and sandwiches were left out. Arriving in to EWR early, with the Luggage Carousel not working. Can’t wait for the next SQ21/23 trip!"

Incoming aircraft arrived late, with no notice/announcements. Boarding Announcements were made, and orderly Started boarding. Crew at the door politely greeted me, and commented on my Rimowa Attaché. Little touches are always nice. Crew did a good job seating everyone. Pushed back, and took off. Served a meal, options available. Crew continued presence, and strong service.

Crew warm, vibrant, energetic, and friendly. Short Taxi out, close to runway, and took off. Had a small meal, which was nice touch for a Regional Flight. Landed early in HAN, and I wished a Trainee Cabin Attendant best of luck on Qualifying. Debarking, There was no direction to the Luggage Carousel, no information on it, and no ground staff present. Once again SQ Needs to be training their ground staff, to get better."
2024-09-13,9,9,"""The staff were excellent""","Not Verified | First time on Premium economy and with Singapore for some considerable time. We were travelling from Syd via Singapore to NYC. We had a 12 hr stop (air side) in the Aerotel at Changi between flights. The flight from Syd left pretty much on time on SA's A350-900 for the 8hr trip. Premium economy is set up 2 x 4 x 2 and we had seats 32A and 32C for this leg on the left side of the aircraft. The in flight service was pretty much as we would have expected and hoped for - excellent. We were provided with hot towel before a small glass of sparkling wine (new for us). The seating was a step up from economy being slightly wider and with the increased pitch and recline (plenty of YouTube reviews of this). The trays were stowed in the centre partition between the seats that prevented this from being used as might with an economy seat - but wasn't an issue. We took advantage of the Book the Cook option for meal selection, which was quite extensive (but not available for all services). This meant stewards checked and confirmed our orders and we were served early. The food was overall very good on this flight and they provide you with a full meal service, that is individual small salad, separate mains, dessert, condiments, full steel cutlery, ceramic or porcelain dishes, water, cloth napkins and tray liner. Could not complain and food quality was very good. Qantas could learn a thing or three from SA regarding full carrier meals services as their standards have dropped significantly in recent years to a single one dish type of offering. (at least in their economy class) Additional drinks including tea/coffee, wine, beer or spirits were service just after meals were delivered and on request throughout the flight. Some additional snacks were available from the galley or on request. Most importantly the flight was smooth and seamless as was the on time and safe landing at Changi. It was a bit of a treat having experienced Premium economy and would recommend trying this if able to do so particularly for longer flights. We found the 8+ hrs to Singapore wasn't to much to manage in economy. However of our 4 flights despite being great was probably 4th in overall comfort and experience. Flight 2 - SQ024 - Singapore to NYC - A350-900 We had the 18+ hr flight from Changi to JFK in NYC coming up (which is currently the longest commercially operated flight). This flight only caters for 2 seating classes, Business and Premium economy there is no economy available on this flight due to logistical considerations and overall much less passenger load. We were seated in 39A and 39C for the flight. Again departure was pretty much on time and we set off on this epic journey. The staff were excellent and again we had opted for the Book the Cook menu selection for some of our meals. We were very fortunate with this flight path that passed over Alaska/north pole region and had fantastic views over the upper Rocky Mountains and skirted by Mt McKinley (highest peak in N. America). The 18+ hours passed relatively easily and Singapore Airlines on board entertainment suite provided ample selection to keep you amused. Additional drinks etc were offered throughout the flight. JFK arrival late afternoon/early evening was on time."
2024-09-13,10,10,"""It’s a serious pleasure""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ23 in Premium Economy. Booked in May, no Solo Seat available. Check in at JFK was extremely efficient, and controlled, even with the new machines. Staff friendly. At the gate, announcements were terrible. Seemed like agent wasn’t used to speaking on the announcement system. Boarding was delayed because of? Upon boarding aircraft was rather cold. A few passengers complained, and the crew explained “it’s central controlled A/C”. Took off late. Steward came by with Bottled Water. Throughout the flight aircraft was freezing, and I had to use a blanket. First drink run I had Champagne, but plastic glasses used. Served first meal, and had 2 options. I had the Thai Curry Beef, really tasty. Constant drink runs commenced. I dozed off, waking up to a snack. Crew were friendly with snacks, offering drinks and sandwiches. Second meal was served. I ordered the Shrimp, but got Cheese Omelette. Engaged the staff, and they replaced it. Constant drink rounds, with snack sandwiches at the back, and a Flatbread Pizza finally. Crew prepared us for arrival, extremely professionally, and assisting as needed. Landed before 0500, yet departed over 30 minutes late. It’s a serious pleasure to be SQ21, and SQ23."
2024-08-29,8,8,"""definitely enjoyed the flight""","Not Verified | It was actually my first time going to Auckland in a A350. My Sister's TV screen was not working and they immediately fixed it. This is what I call efficiency. When we took off, about half and hour later, the cabin crew started breakfast service. I chose the nasi lemak and orange jucie. Very good! Only downside was that it was supposed to be fried chicken but the chicken was breast meat. But I don't blame them for that. Cabin crew were extremely friendly. Food was very very good too. I definitely enjoyed the flight."
2024-08-29,9,9,"""consistently high quality""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines continues to provide consistently high quality on-board service. Cabin crew are always polite, friendly, helpful and professional. Seat design varies according to aircraft type and route. Some work better than others. Lounge quality varies - especially when not operated by Singapore Airlines. Food and beverage quality, choice and delivery remain a very high standard. Cabin service runs like clockwork and team co-operation works well and this shows. IFE was excellent. Priority tags sometimes don't work in that priority baggage arrives anytime - not always first."
2024-08-28,7,7,"""ground service was appalling","✅ Trip Verified | The ground service was appalling. Singapore Airlines does not seem to have much of a presence in Dubai anymore and DNATA handles everything. To say that the check-in counter staff was inefficient and ignorant would be an understatement. She did not even know that Scoot Airlines is a partner of SQ and had no clue about which terminal it operates, and worse still she gave the wrong information. In-flight service and food were excellent as usual but on arrival, the ground staff were again inefficient. IFE was outstanding and the free wifi was well appreciated. SQ has a weird policy of not providing amenities and will only offer it if asked for."
2024-08-28,3,3,"""they are unable to compensate me""","Not Verified | I have flown SQ for years and also reached Solitaire status with them for the last few years. Generally, I have always been happy with their service until I encountered a problem. My recent experience with them on a flight from Sydney to Singapore was more than disappointing. The flight was supposed to leave at 11:00 am. However, when I arrived at the airport at 9:00 am I was told that there might be some delays due to technical problems. When I finished immigration and security, I was made aware that the flight was delayed to after 6:00 pm. No one from Singapore Airlines was available to talk to as I was looking to leave the airport and go back to the city instead of waiting the whole day at the airport. Unfortunately, the lounge was also closed due to renovation works. Luckily, we could use the Air New Zealand Lounge and employees there kept promising us that a SQ staff would come and talk to us in 10-15 minutes. In any way, they said that there will be an announcement when the SQ staff would arrive. Well, the staff never showed up until a couple of hours later and there was also never an announcement. Since SQ also just sent one rep, the queue was quite massive. While waiting in the queue a rep called me (I assume that happened because of my high tier status) and offered that I could rebook to the 3 pm flight but they would need to downgrade me to economy class. After asking them about the fare difference, they confirmed that the far difference will be compensated in cash later. I therefore accepted the rebooking. At the time when I was boarding the plane and they were scanning my ticket, they were suddenly asking me to sign a letter. After asking about the content of the letter, they told me that they would compensate me $400 but I would drop any further claims. I told them that I would not sign a letter I have never read while a queue is standing behind me and proceeded to board the plane. Since, I have not heard from them since that day, I was following up on my compensation. Their response is that they are unable to compensate me and said they would give me 20,000 KrisFlyer miles instead. I did enjoy flying with SQ in the past and their cabin crew is second to none. However, dealing with SQ corporate when there is a problem is something I would like to avoid in the future. So I have decided to change airlines once i used all my miles."

2024-08-22,7,7,“meal was not provided”,"Not Verified | I am writing this review for the muslim meal preference, I requested for the muslim meal but meal was not provided, they said we have not booked, but we had booked, it was really sad, I didn't expect this from Singapore, first time it has happened to me. Really disappointed, they said it was not booked, but my agent rechecked it and it was done"
2024-08-22,6,6,"""amazing cabin crew""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight from London to Singapore on the 18th was delayed by about an hour. I was worried about making my connection to Tokyo and asked the cabin crew how best to proceed when I arrived in Singapore. They told me not to worry as ground staff would be there to assist. When I arrived in Singapore, the only assistance was ground staff saying 'Tokyo flight that way' and pointing. I ended up having to sprint through the airport (a very long way) and only just made my connecting flight. Either ground staff should have said that it was not possible to make the flight or they should have had transportation ready to get me to the gate quickly. Singapore Airlines made no effort to help me make the tight connection. As it was, my bags were unable to make it. This caused more inconvenience when I landed at Tokyo. Singapore Airlines ground staff were not very helpful. There were people around the baggage carousel to help me arrange delivery of my bags. However, the best that they could do was to offer to deliver the bags in two days. I said to the ground staff that if they couldn't deliver the bags for two days, could they provide me money to buy these essentials. They point-blank refused. I therefore insisted that the bags be delivered sooner. It was a real battle to get this sorted out and took almost an hour. This was after more than 30 hours after leaving my home in the UK. The ground staff seemed to have zero understanding of the fact that I was tired. They also kept offering to deliver the bags at times that I would be at work. It seemed a case of me having to work around their schedule rather than them having to work around mine. This whole lack of consideration for what was convenient for me after having had my bags delayed through no fault of my own, just added insult to injury. The airline also gave me a meal with fish in on the Tokyo to Singapore flight despite the fact that I had ordered a vegetarian meal. They did apologise profusely for this and gave me compensation in the form of a voucher. Singapore Airlines have amazing cabin crew. On all four flights, they went above and beyond to assist and ensure that I had a good journey. However, I feel like the airline is depending upon the excellent service/attitude of the cabin crew and that the rest of the airline's services leave a lot to be desired. The ground staff in particular were extremely unhelpful and seemed like they really were not interested in the customers. The check-in staff at London Gatwick were extremely unfriendly and rude. I expect good service all round from an airline not just when I am in the air. While I love the in-flight service with Singapore Airlines, I would seriously consider whether to fly with them again due to the very poor service/attitude that the ground staff seem to have. A five-star airline (which has been voted the best airline in the world on several occasions) should have more to offer than simply excellent cabin crew."

While we arrived at the boarding gate at there was more than 12 wheel chair bound passengers queueing in the Economy Class and Business Class lane. We were waiting in the business class queue to board when the female staff boarded 5 Economy class passengers. When queried she informed us that they are accompanying a passenger on wheel chair, I did not understand the logic in 5 persons helping one passenger on wheel chair. The process was a chaos and mis-managed. We had to wait on the ramp leading to the airplane door for more than 20 minutes."
2024-08-15,4,4,"""worst if not the worst flight on SQ""","Not Verified | One of the worst if not the worst flight on SQ. Boarded last walked to my seat. FA was talking to the passenger seated in front of my seat. She acknowledged me and I sat down. No offer of pre takeoff drinks or hot towel. Same FA came to me and confirmed my meal order and said lunch would be served at 12pm. Flight was a day flight taking off at 9am. After takeoff again no after takeoff drink/nuts offered. Lights dimmed. Lunch was to be served around 1130am. So for 2 1/2 hours I did not see any FAs in the cabin. Nothing offered during that time. This is in Business Class mind you. Lunch service was the usual standard but honestly the crew were mediocre. Not to mention never saw the Inflight Manager the whole flight except just prior to landing. The seat was the regional type and I hate it. It's too cramped and uncomfortable. SQ your service has really gone down the hill. What has happened to the famous ""inflight service even other airlines talk about""? Very sad to see such a great airline before go down the drain."
2024-08-05,10,10,"""truly outstanding""","✅ Trip Verified |   My recent flight with Singapore Airlines was truly outstanding. From the smooth check-in process to the comfortable and well-maintained cabin, every aspect of the journey was exceptional. The in-flight entertainment options were extensive, and the meals were delicious and well-presented. A special thank you to Nur Atisah, whose remarkable service and warm demeanor made the flight even more enjoyable. Her attentiveness and care exemplify the high standards of Singapore Airlines and significantly enhanced my travel experience. Overall, Singapore Airlines delivers a superior flying experience, and I highly recommend them for anyone seeking comfort and exceptional service."

2024-07-30,1,1,"“mismanaged, irresponsible”","✅ Trip Verified | I took a flight from Bangkok to Tokyo via Singapore and was told that one of my luggages could not be placed on the flight from Singapore to Tokyo. The ground staff in Tokyo explained that it was because the flight I chose had a short connection time. No, no, no, this flight was recommended by Singapore Airlines when I made the reservation, rather than my choice. She said the package was late because I chose it? I have never heard such a nonsensical shifting of responsibility before. Moreover, the ground staff explained that Singapore Airlines is not responsible for checked baggage and that this was agreed upon at the time of booking. Well, this is what I call an irresponsible handling. She further explained that the package would not arrive at my place only after 2 days. In Japan, logistics is so advanced that it is normal for a package to arrive on the same day as the shipping date if it is in Tokyo. When I pointed this out, they finally arranged for same day delivery after a 30 minute wait. In other words, it was Singapore Airlines' fault, but they would not make the best arrangements unless we told them. However, the next day I received another call. They don't know why, but I was told that my luggage was not loaded on the scheduled flight at Changi Airport again and did not arrive in Tokyo the next day. Will my package ever be delivered? I have found this company to be mismanaged, irresponsible, and responsible without any shame. Please be careful, everyone."

2024-07-11,1,1,"""prevented me from logging in to my account""","✅ Trip Verified | As part of my student privileges I get 1 free change which they caused unnecessary delays of over 2 weeks to help me with. They have been asking personal information and the exact same documents repeatedly with me talking to different representatives over the same thing again and again. They will act like they want to help but will actually provide no transparency and will only waste your time. In fact, their technical team prevented me from logging in to my account and magically on making a complaint and sending them screenshots of reduced fares, they responded and took 2 weeks more to let me login to my account. Their actions need to be reported."
2024-07-07,5,5,"""No compensation""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines quality has declined significantly over the years. I used to fly regularly but stopped taking it for a while until yesterday on a long haul flight from Houston. Food and beverage - Just above average. Beef bourguignon was overcooked and not tender. Chicken Tikka lacks flavor. Poor wine selection. Only one that was really good was the singaporean crab cake. Premium economy lacks leg room vs others. Pillow case is old and faded in color. Some parts of seat sides not cleaned properly. Entertainment Behind vs others. Live TV doesn’t work. Lacks in brightness and sharpness. Lack of TV series options. Worst, it was down the whole 24 hrs flight during my wife and kids travel on June 18th. They gave compensation vouchers but only for inflight shopping which lacks necessary / useful items. Wifi onboard while it’s free it lacks the speed. Amenities did not get any. Not even eye mask, tooth brush. Cabin crew no longer the proud “singapore hospitality” it once was. Some friendly and attentive, some others just wanting to get the flight over and go home. One even mistook connecting headphone to headphone jack as phone charging so she forced me to take it off during landing and when she realize she was wrong did not say sorry. During my flight from Houston on July 5th I suddenly received notice that baggage is transferred to another flight. While it’s good they notified early and they delivered to my holiday accommodation, had to wait for 8 hours without clothing and basic necessities and ended up doing last minute shopping. They acted as if it’s a normal situation. No compensation. Punctuality I have to say they still excel in this area (hence the two star). It seems likely that SQ has exercised significant budget cuts post covid to increase profitability. However, price is still high vs others so it’s time to take a reflection."
2024-07-04,10,10,“A fantastic flight!”,"Not Verified | A fantastic flight! Crew made me feel very comfortable from the first moment I entered the plane.

2024-06-28,9,9,“the best customer service”,"✅ Trip Verified | My wife and I flew Singapore Airlines from Frankfurt to Jakarta with stop over in Singapore on SQ25, and SQ964. I just want to commend all the cabin crews on both flights, they are such a dedicated crews and very professional. I ranked them as the best customer service in any airlines that I have flown before. The plane is a bit worn but they have maintained their interior, seats are comfortable, and is spotless. The inflight entertainments needs an upgrade, and meals were a bit degraded from the previous experienced with them, but I truly enjoyed flying with Singapore airlines for their friendly and top of the notch customer service."

2024-06-16,1,1,"""they wouldn’t refund the money""","Not Verified | I had a business flight booked and due to the sad passing of my mother I asked if I could pull the outbound leg forward to tie in with her funeral. Singapore Airlines were very kind and said they would move the flight at no charge to me on compassionate grounds. I was very pleased as had enough going on. When I checked the booking they had not moved to the correct airport. I was then told the move would cost around $2k. I asked where the compassion had gone and a week or so later I took a call from a rep to say they would be refunding the difference. I was happy as felt they had dealt with properly. Later that evening I received an email telling me they were looking into the case, but I said there was no need as I had taken a call to say all ok. Wind forward a few weeks and I have taken numerous calls and emails telling me they are looking into the refund. A few days ago I was told I wouldn’t be refund. I just took that call, and the rep said they wouldn’t refund the money and I could cancel my flight for a refund. As you can imagine, I was more than upset that SA were advising me to cancel my flight for my mother’s funeral for a refund. This is an airline who just announced record profits and prior to this and been a pleasure to fly with. But clearly profits come before passengers now."

2024-06-12,1,1,“Sadly disappointed”,"Not Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines to avoid cheaper budget airlines thinking it would be a better experience by paying more for the flight. Sadly disappointed, food choice was not available then the offering provided was cold. No drinks offered, seats were stacked so close together to squeeze as many as possible into the available space. Inflight entertainment is really bad. Appears Singapore is trying to extract as much money as possible from its passengers while offering nothing better than budget airlines. Will not fly them again and urge others to look at options."

Her colleague did that, and printed my two Lufthansa connection boarding passes. We boarded on time. Empty business class. Menus are back, hot towels are back, and amenity kits. You had to ask for a kit. It is nice, but I’m rather buffaloed you do not check the other slippers, like they have in Business Class. Crew was extremely attentive, and friendly. Champagne served in the plastic glasses. IFE seemed ok, for a short hop. This crew didn’t go around forcing everyone to put there shades down, like previous SQ25 flights had. For dinnner I had the Cantonese Pork, was really good. Multiple Champagne rounds, and a round of Shiraz to go with the Cheese. Only slept 90-120 minutes. Crew did 0 drink runs, and seem to have disappeared. 90 minutes out of FRA, Came out with New Beginnings Refreshment Sandwiches, and drink run. Arriving into FRA on time. Definitely will continue flying with SQ."
2024-06-04,1,1,"“I mistook 12pm for midnight""","✅ Trip Verified | My recent return flights Singapore to Rome on Singapore Airlines were the worst airline experience I've had in my 50 years of international travel and I paid a premium for it. I booked my flights thinking I would treat myself to a quality experience and also paid over SGD50 to reserve my preferred seats. A longwinded online check in which didn't allow me to select carry on only. I needed the airport check in counter to sort that out. Then I noticed I'm not in my reserved seat, instead I have been seated in one of the worst seats in the plane, opposite the toilets. The flight was late, service was chaotic and I was constantly disturbed by the toilet use. I contacted customer service after the flight. ‘Operational/technical reasons’ were the excuse for my seat change (no change of plane type); no they wouldn't refund the seat reservation fee (they are reviewing but no word for 5 weeks). Also the reserved seat on my return flight was also unavailable (to me) and no, no refund, they would try to find a similar seat. I was passed around a series of CSRs, all of whom were brusque, intransigent and unhelpful. For my return flight, online check in would not let me register my Kris Flyer account because someone at SA had altered my name details. This took over an hour to sort out. In the end I missed the flight because I mistook 12pm for midnight. I contacted SA and was offered a seat on the next flight for SGD1400 'as a courtesy'. Even upset I said no to that. I booked with Gulf Air for SGD700, but I noticed in my searches the flight the CSR had offered, available online for SGD1000. The worst customer service and flight experience I have ever had from an airline that markets itself as offering a premium experience. By all means use SA if it's the cheapest deal, you'll get the same experience as anywhere else. I wouldn't pay a premium to fly with them because you won't get anything for your money. The airline knows how to market itself and maybe at one time, its service was above standard, but no longer. Reviews reveal that quality has tumbled post Covid. Clearly the bean counters have taken over as the airline tries to recoup its losses. In my recent experience, SA has been the rudest, most unhelpful and grudging airline I have ever dealt with and I will be avoiding them in future."
2024-06-01,10,10,"""excellent inflight service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines never fails to deliver on its excellent inflight service. On this 16 hour flight, I booked the cook for the two meals - baked lobster for the first meal and chicken briyani for the second. Both meals were really delicious . The movie selection was extensive. I watched the latest Mission Impossible movie on board after the first meal. I managed to sleep for a continuous period of 6 hours before waking up for the second meal. Free wifi was available throughout the flight and was of decent speed. Cabin crew were very helpful and helped to convert the seat to bed mode for sleeping. A special shout-out to LS Jim for his personal care and service."
2024-05-30,8,8,"""onboard experiences were good""","Not Verified | Flew from SIN to MNL on Business class and the experience I had with Singapore airlines was an overall pleasant one. Check in staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The SilverKris Lounge at T3 was phenomenal with amazing wide selection of food, relaxing ambience and the one thing I love most is the private nap room. I took a shower which they had facilities in the lounge. The T2 SilverKris lounge looked dated and the food presentation could have been better. The overall ambience, furniture and interior of T2 SKL felt that it did not fit the branding of Singapore airlines and it just felt crowded and not luxurious or relaxing at all. Flying back to Singapore I took SQ business class while my parents were in economy. I was very disappointed because since two weeks prior to the flight I was not able to select seats for my parents who wanted to sit as far up in the forward zone so that I can assist them asap when needed. I even tried reaching out to Singapore airlines but to no avail and I felt like they had little to no empathy in understanding the situation. At one point while using the live chat on the SQ app, the representative was sarcastic which made me feel so disgusted. I also understand that Singapore airlines also does allow us to do online check in up to 48hrs prior to departure time but for some reason they were already allocated seats even before the check in time. The SQ app nor the website didn’t allow us to purchase seats for them and this was very disappointing. Nevertheless, the staff at Manila airport T3 were very friendly too and the SilverKris Lounge at Manila could also have a better range of food selection. Majority of the food there were just quick bites and I felt there should have been rice made available at least. The whole boarding process for my flight SQ919 seemed pretty messy with no staff managing the crowd properly as well in which I don’t entirely blame SQ but blame the airport management for it. Overall the onboard experiences were good and catering was not too bad as well. I just don’t wish for anyone to experience what my parents and I experience when it came to selecting / pre purchasing seats prior to the flight, it was truly not great experience but an inconvenience we will never forget."
2024-05-25,10,10,"""experienced impeccable service""","✅ Trip Verified | My group of travellers experienced impeccable service on this flight. One of us fell became nauseous during the flight, and Eva, the leading stewardess, was of great. She managed to find us some vicks, which really helped stem the nausea. She also checked in frequently to ensure that all was well. Lawrence, the chief steward, was also very welcoming and friendly, and had an affable presence that made the otherwise long journey comforting. Cheryl and Maria, who served us, never forgot details. While service was interrupted during turbulence, one episode lasting longer than 30 min, they could resume where they left off, not forgetting details or requests. This was such a wonderful set of crew, and our group agreed that SQ long haul I'd indeed a cut above, and a great way to fly. Grateful for the experience. Pilots were skillful as well, and navigate the turbulence well."
2024-05-23,2,2,"""I requested compensation""","✅ Trip Verified | My baggage was delayed on both my onward and return flights. I requested compensation for my trip to Kochi, as I had to purchase clothes and toiletries. However, I was only offered AUD 50. I spent AUD 150 on these items. The response from the customer service team of Singapore Airline was very poor."
2024-05-22,4,4,“The food was not good”,"Not Verified | This was an old 777 and even the seat mechanism was dated. The cabin crew had little enthusiasm for their work and were rarely visible. I asked one crew member 3 times for slippers but none came. Later I went to the galley looking for snacks but none were available. However sometime later some two plastic bags of snacks were found by the crew. The toilets in business class were not cleaned and became revolting. The second meal was served 5 hours before our scheduled arrival and 6 hours before our actual arrival. The food was not good. The Malaysian meals I ordered bore little resemblance to that available in Singapore or Malaysia. Finally, I wrote to Singapore Airlines complaining about our unpleasant flight back to London but received no response."
2024-05-22,1,1,“Extremely disappointing”,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely disappointing. I had high hopes for a wonderful experience but was disappointed. I have flown business class with numerous airlines and would rank them below Emirates, Qatar, Korean Air, ANA, Asiana, EVA, Air New Zealand and even below United Polaris. This was a 10-hour flight with lie-flat seats. The seats were not simple to recline and yet the flight attendants were not helpful. On Emirates, Qatar and Air New Zealand, they practically hover over you to make your bed and even tuck you in. Here, they were nowhere to be found, leaving us to fend for ourselves. The food was mediocre, cafeteria quality. The main was lobster thermidor which I special ordered. Maybe it’s not right to expect lobster on a plane ride but it was on the menu and given their rave reviews, I wanted to try it. The lobster was served room temperature and was both too tough and not very tasty, although it was pretty to behold. The wines were very mediocre, like bottles you could pick up at a street corner convenience store. I actually tried small portions of all 3 of their reds and 1 of the whites and was displeased with all of them. Other airlines take pride in their wine selection but these were not palatable. Breakfast was waffles which were soggy in the middle and tough on the edges. Again, like the lobster, perhaps this is probably not a good thing to order on a plane since it’s just reheated from the previous day. Possibly an omelette would have been better. In another example of the disappointing service, twice I had to repeat a drink request—to refill my water bottle. On other airlines, once you put your empty bottle on the side, you don’t even have to ask. They immediately grab it and refill it or get a new one. Twice, I had to ask two times for a refill. My WiFi connection didn’t work despite numerous attempts over the course of the 10-hour flight. I didn’t mind much but those who want this amenity should be forewarned. My final first-world complaint—my suitcase was very late to arrive even though it had clearly identifiable priority tags. Another business class no-no. Listen, these may seem like petty complaints but there is so much competition between airlines, and some are genuinely stellar, time after time. When paying thousands of dollars for a ticket, I think it’s acceptable to expect decent service and products. This was my first experience with Singapore Air and I went out of my way to experience them because of the hoopla. Next time, I will rely on a different airline. I’ll NEVER fly Singapore Air again."
2024-05-20,8,8,“impeccable service”,✅ Trip Verified | This was our first time on a Singapore Airlines Boeing 737 Max. Only 6 of the 10 business class seats were taken and we were seated in the only 2 ‘throne seats’ on this plane. These seats were very comfortable and perfect for a short haul flight. What made this flight exceptional for us were the extremely nice and ultra professional 2 flight attendants that really did their utmost to pamper us and give us an impeccable service. Food and drinks were super despite ‘Book the Cook’ wasn’t available on this flight to SIN. We had a connecting flight from SIN where ‘Book the Cook’ was available but where previously lobster always used to be one of the options to select it now no longer is available. This is really a pity as this was one of our favourites on SQ flights. Perhaps they introduced this as a cost saving but I do not understand why they should do a cost saving while the cost of the already expensive tickets increased almost 50%. Recent flights we took on SQ were also somewhat inconsistent and what makes or breaks a good flight for us is a good crew. Despite the super flight from Denpasar to Singapore we unfortunately had a few flights with SQ where some of the crew members weren’t that professional. We pay a lot of money for a good service so it’s obvious we get the impeccable service we paid for.
2024-05-19,1,1,"""cut its in-flight service""",✅ Trip Verified | We fly Singapore Airlines regularly to India since the year 2001 from Melbourne mainly due to their transit time in Singapore. Post-Covid this airline has cut its in-flight service in Economy class. There is no 2nd meal provided in Melbourne to Singapore sector under the pretext of passengers not wanting to eat since it's a midnight departure. They have replaced the 2nd meal which used to be breakfast before the touchdown in Singapore by a puff. Water is served but the orange & apple juice cups are reduced as well as hot towel service. The check-in is chaotic in Melbourne. Why should we fly Singapore Airlines when Qatar & Emirates offer a superior service than SQ.
2024-05-14,8,8,“cabin crew helpful and friendly”,"✅ Trip Verified | Really satisfied with the quality and service with Singapore Airlines. Flew from the UK to Australia, and there was no problems or issues on the way. Food and IFE was above par, and the cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Would fly with them again."
2024-05-10,10,10,"""I am really impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | First time ever i fly Singapore Airlines on long haul and I am really impressed. Boarding was very well organised in 8 groups, therefore not the usual queues in the aircraft. The economy seat was quite comfortable compared to other airlines and had several stowing pockets. Food was very good and tasty and when i ask for little snack in between they bring me chips, chocolate and a cereal bar. Sandwich was also available. The crew was regular providing juices, water and softdrinks and had a smile on their faces. As a frequent flyer i need to say that was the best economy experience ever and i felt like a valued customer."
2024-05-10,10,10,"""helpful, kind and super friendly""","Not Verified | Cabin crew are very helpful, kind and super friendly on this flight today May 10th 2024, SQ212 flying from Sydney to Singapore. It really make my day with their friendly gesture and their kind concerns towards each and every passenger on board. Aircraft bathroom is clean and I’m very happy with the free wifi connected on board (with the help from one of the helpful steward). Enjoy the nice meal provided as well as my favourite ice cream. Overall a very good experience with Singapore airline on today’s flight."
2024-05-05,10,10,"""looked after us very well""",Not Verified | We flew Singapore airlines from Perth W.A. yesterday. Our flight was delayed because of thunderstorms. Consequently we missed our connection in Frankfort for Dublin. I am writing this because I was most impressed with their efficiency in handling redirected flights and accommodation. They looked after us very well and had everything organized for us. Also the staff on both flights were extremely kind and helpful. No wonder Singapore Airlines are voted the best in the world. Well done to everyone concerned.
2024-05-01,1,1,"""deeply disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | Our recent experience has been deeply disappointing. We faced severe disruptions which necessitated rerouting and resulted in significant extra costs and inconveniences. Singapore Airlines failed to reimburse us for necessary ground transportation. We attempted multiple times to resolve this issue amicably, reaching out through the proper channels and addressing higher management. Each time, our efforts were met with a lack of response or dismissive templated apologies, without any attempt to address the core issues or fulfill promised compensations."
2024-04-28,3,3,"""lacked any sincerity and initiative""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight SQ636. Our flight to Tokyo was scheduled for 9:50 pm 20/4/24 but the plane only took off at nearly 1 am 21/4/24. The pilot first announced that an Engineer was on his way to check on the plane as there is a technical fault. After about 40 mins, he comes back on to inform that the Engineer is still on the way and that a part in the plane would have to be checked. After another 30 mins or so, the pilot announced that there will be a need to replace a part in the plane with a nearby plane and that they would have to conduct a full shutdown of the power in the plane. We were left in darkness for about 10 mins with no lighting and fresh oxygen. There was more waiting till a further hour before the pilot announced that the part has been replaced and that the plane would take off in 10 mins - that did not happen for about a further 40 mins. Throughout the entire ordeal, the pilot sounded very cavalier and while he apologised a few times, his tone and voice came across as if it is just a game or that it was no big deal. Why allow us to board when the plane has technical issues? Why isn't there an Engineer on site at Changi Airport SIA is a local airline? Why isn't there ready supply of spare parts that you need to get from another plane? At the end of the flight, all we got was an email apologising to us for the delay. The least that SIA can do to show that it really takes the sloppiness as a serious quality issue is to give all the passengers gift vouchers or free miles. As an airline that prides itself as a top international airline not only was the flight experience my worst one, but the post-sale experience lacked any sincerity and initiative."
2024-04-24,8,8,"""they changed the boarding gate""","Not Verified | Flight schedule at 9:30. We entered through scan check stations and were waiting for boarding. At 9:00, they changed the boarding gate from C23 to B8. Rescheduled at 10:30. Why not fix this issue? SIN to Perth."
2024-04-23,1,1,"""Terrible online chat service""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible online chat service. I was traveling with my 2 dogs as checked excess baggage and needed to know some information. I knew that the airline allowed dogs to be checked as excess baggage and that they had recently scrapped their policy of allowing dogs in the cabin. However, when I asked my questions regarding traveling with my dogs, the online chat service staff kept coming up with different stories about how pets are banned on Singapore Airlines flights altogether, including in cargo. This person also was not able to answer some basic questions, and was not even fluent in basic English. Attempts to request to be in contact with the staff's manager were in vain as the staff simply ignored my messages. When checking my dogs in, the staff at the counter were confused and did not know how to check my dogs in. They had to call a number of their superiors to assist them with the process and made me wait for a very long time. Today, I contacted them via their online chat service once again to ask a question and all they did was constantly copy and paste the exact same line from one of their web pages which I had already seen and was exactly what I was trying to clarify. Absolutely useless online customer service staff in my opinion. And frankly, there is nothing special or outstanding about this airline."
2024-04-21,5,5,"""Food was below par""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall disappointing from Singapore Airlines. Late and disorganized boarding. The A350-900 is a tired old thing. Does anyone seriously use the coat hanger button on the seat back in front of you? This aircraft has no air outlets above seats and made the trip stuffy. The entertainment system was very old and dated movies, yes even the so called “recent releases”. TV selections were abysmal. This was the first international flight I watched nothing at all on. Food was below par and drinks service patchy. I used to think Singapore Airlines was a great airline but after this flight I beg to differ. One good point is the staff on board professional and friendly."
2024-04-21,6,6,"""recent pricing and service changes""","✅ Trip Verified | I usually fly Singapore Airlines internationally, since 10 years I am a Krisflyer Gold member. The recent pricing and service changes, show the results of bailed out airlines believing ethical standards don't apply to them anymore. Unbelievably toxic SIA service for business customers. Bear in mind if you fly for business and may have changes you will need 3 days and potentially dozens of phone calls and sessions to even rebook flexi tickets which then costs north of 1000$. This particular flight was booked via our company travel agent, a large international agent. Leaving aside the drop in service quality over years, from discontinuing warm towels to not offering snacks anymore during the flight, what has really infuriated me with SIA are the change policies. On this flight, despite having the highest premium economy booking class (T) with a full flexi ticket, a simple change in flight date cost me >1000$ extra is unexplained fees: In addition to the change in ticket price, which makes no sense on the highest booking class, a rebooking fee, a no show fee , a digital processing fee and the worst 250$ of ""offline"" fee because I used an agent, not their website. While my agent was helpful, SIA straight out refused to talk to them. It took 3 full days and 15 chat sessions to actually get the ticket rebooked for a simple day change on the exact same flight, SIA let them wait 30min per session, as they are only available to agents during Singapore business hours - and if they are closes they simply hang up."
2024-04-14,10,10,"""Crew was super nice""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight was great! Crew was super nice, Chief Stewardess & FSS showered me with many snacks! And one of the FSS gave me a bag tag, offered to take my picture, and had a little talk. She was so kind and fun. The food was delicious. Booked BTC (The burger & Steak), burger was amazing, chefs kiss. What The steak was a little over cooked but that’s okay, the sides were delicious. The seat was clean, as well as the bathroom. IFE had many movies, shows, music to choose from. Seat could transform to a full flat bed, inflight wifi could be used for instagram, WhatsApp, etc. Crew tried to keep me entertained at every moment, offering me such things as snacks, toys etc. Love Singapore Airlines. The world class service is wonderful. Check in experience with LHR was good but not amazing, girl who checked me in looks rather annoyed. Lounge was great, gave me a free lion teddy."
2024-04-13,9,9,"""attendants are helpful and polite""",✅ Trip Verified | The cabin is clean. Flight attendants are helpful and polite. Seats can be reclined easily. The food is delicious and fresh. Flights departed on time.
2024-04-12,3,3,"""food were served last""",Not Verified | From Kochi to Singapore and vice verse we travelled in economy class and we opted for extra legroom seats. The seats were in the middle of the aircraft and food were served last for us. Both times the non-veg food (chicken) got finished and we were had to eat veg food.
2024-04-07,5,5,"""seat spacing is less""","✅ Trip Verified |   The flight went from Terminal 1, the terminal with limited amenities. I was handed a voucher to a Sats lounge that was overfilled in terminal 1. The gate was chaos, under-dimensioned for the flight with 1 security screening. When I arrived the queue was >50m with a wait of about 20min. While service and entertainment in Economy is as good as one can expect from Singapore Airlines, seat spacing is less than in other airlines."
2024-03-31,10,10,"""service was efficient and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ894 is the afternoon flight to HKG operated by the A350. It was during the Lunar New Year period. On the menu was the traditional Yu Sheng or raw fish salad popular in Singapore and Malaysia during Lunar New Year. I booked the cook and had lobster thermidor as my main course. For a 3.5 hour flight the service was efficient and friendly. On this A350, the seat back needs to be flipped over to convert into bed mode but it wasn’t necessary on this short flight. Wifi connectivity was good."
2024-03-31,1,1,“Very disappointed”,✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Dated and uncomfortable old seat in business class combined with below average food. Ok cabin crews. Last but not least they lost my bag. I would fly SQ again on short haul on a discount economy class ticket…
2024-03-30,1,1,"""incompetent customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying business class from BCN to MLE via SIN. The flight with SQ was just a big hassle all the way through. The night before the BCN departure I was informed via SMS that the flight from BCN to SIN would be delayed by more that 3 hours. That was it. SQ could not have cared less about re-booking the flight proactively so that I would not miss my MLE connection in SIN. I had to call their incompetent customer service in Singapore and fight with them for 2 hours on the phone so that my flight was eventually rebooked via MUC - FOn the re-booked leg they managed to lose my bag in MUC. I did trace the bag with an Apple air tag and it was delivered to SIN the next day. Rather than getting the bag on the next flight to MLE, SQ kept it in SIN for another two days before sending it on to MLE From my experience, SQ is ok as it comes to cabin service (whilst you can see their cost saving actions as well with no more amenity kits in C, cheap wines etc.). However, as it comes to customer service, SQ is absolutely below any standard I have ever seen. In fact they could not care less about their customer - and I am speaking of business class."
2024-03-28,2,2,"""not be flying Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines continues to enjoy a good reputation, however my most recent experience was very poor and fell far short of my expectations. Due to a cancellation by another airline, I needed to modify the departure on my full fare, refundable ticket. I completed the customer assistance form on their website to request the rebooking, and tried repeatedly over an 8 hour period to reach their customer service number in the US. It was impossible to get past the recording and reach an agent over the phone. It was also not possible to make this change myself online. Upon arriving at Changi, I discovered that instead of changing my outbound flight as requested, Singapore Airlines cancelled my entire ticket. When I tried to rebook the flight, there was not a single open seat for the return over a two day period (Easter weekend). Agents at Changi were apologetic and tried to help, but with no seats available, there was little they could do. I have never before been unable to reach an airline representative, and this has certainly not been the case when I have tried multiple channels over an 8 hour time period. I am appalled by the lack of basic customer service extended to a passenger holding a Y fare ticket and Star Alliance Gold status. I would encourage any US-based traveler to avoid Singapore Airlines at all costs until they can bring their customer service up to a minimum level. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines again."
2024-03-27,5,5,“economy class felt really cramped”,"✅ Trip Verified | The economy class felt really cramped. You can barely get out of your seat when the seat in front of you is fully reclined. Seats can be inclined really deep to the discomfort of passengers sitting behind. Oh, and check out the poor dinner I don’t understand what they’re charging a premium for."
2024-03-26,3,3,"""infotainment system was faulty""","✅ Trip Verified | My experience with the ground staff, cabin facilities and the cabin crew, has been pathetic. Ground staff at Delhi was rude and bossy. Cabin crew didn't take the requests of the passengers. Choice/request for Food and beverages were taken but they served as per their choices. My infotainment system was faulty. My wife was not given jain food on return leg even when request was made 2-3 days in advance. The toilet lacked supplies on the return leg. My wifi didn't work for more than half of the travel time on both legs. I have vowed not to travel Singapore airlines ever again."
2024-03-01,9,9,"""Flight was amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight was amazing. The crew onboard this flight were very welcoming, and gave a good atmosphere. The crew serving my aisle goes by the initial “G”. She was very kind & helpful. Gave my mom a bday cake for a late celebration even though it was just a 1hr 45min flight. Seat is well sanitized, legroom is spacious. IFE onboard has many variety of shows, music, etc. Bathroom always kept clean by crew at all times. & Food was delicious, overall this flight is a 9/10"
2024-02-21,3,3,"""seats on this aircraft are dreadful""",✅ Trip Verified |  Booking an emergency exit seat still meant huge discomfort in a seat far too narrow and poor padding meaning back ache in 90 minute flight. The seats on this aircraft are dreadful. The headphones and sound on the entertainment system was dreadful.
2024-02-20,10,10,"""Food was plentiful and tasty""",✅ Trip Verified | Excellent performance on all fronts. I would definitely choose to use this airline again. The aircraft is well-maintained and the staff well-trained on hospitality. Food was plentiful and tasty.
2024-02-19,10,10,"“how much food was available""","✅ Trip Verified | Pretty comfortable flight considering I was flying in economy class in one of the older aircraft in their fleet which is still kept in relatively good condition. The economy class cabin was in a 3-3-3 configuration and the flight was almost full. What amazed me most was how much food was available for economy passengers - 2 full meals and the rear galley was stocked with snacks. The crew came round regularly with trays of drinks and juice through the flight. I disembarked with a very full stomach! The timing of main meals and the lighting/dimming of the cabin were done sensitively. The cabin crew seemed willing to please, it makes interactions pleasant and the whole experience that bit more enjoyable. Eye-masks were not handed out but were provided upon request. The economy class toilets were stocked with complimentary toothbrushes. Wifi was supposedly free but didn't seem to work for the duration of the flight. However, there was a diverse choice of movies and TV programmes."
2024-02-19,10,10,“service was consistently good”,"✅ Trip Verified | The service was consistently good from start to finish. The cabin crew showcased the friendly Singaporean culture at its finest. It seemed like they really cared for the passengers, which is what I liked the most. The seat was comfortable and wide range of movies was provided (too many to choose from even!)"
2024-02-19,3,3,“seat is absolutely dreadful”,"✅ Trip Verified | This flight was over six hours long on a B737 MAX8. I booked an emergency exit row seat by the window. The seat is absolutely dreadful. Lacks padding, and within a few hours, developed back ache that lasted for several days after the flight. The left and right armrests effectively reduce the working seat width to 12 inches. The B737 MAX is not fit for purpose for long haul flights and I would recommend that you do fly on this aircraft unless its for a flight duration of no more than 2 hours. Most passengers I spoke to by the end of the flight were also having back aches too. The flight also run out of wine and beer before they had completed serving the lunch so inflight service also very poor indeed. The sound on the entertainment system was also poor and the earphones kept falling out of your ears."
2024-02-19,5,5,"""Very ordinary service""","✅ Trip Verified | Boarding process went smoothly, and plane left on time. I had a window seat in the first part of economy section. The plane has 3-4-3 layout. We were 3 adults on this row, and it was very narrow. When the passenger in front of me, reclined his seat, i could hardly look at my screen, and could not fold out the table. The crew told people to raise up the seat backs during the meal times. We had two meals, dinner and breakfast, both meals were ok. I wanted to charge my phone during the flight, usb charger wad not working. I remember many years ago, when travelling with Singapore Airlines, the drink trolley came before the meal, and again when you got the meal, and they showed up again shortly after the meal also. Now you just get drinks along with the meal, and they do not ask if you want a refill. Very ordinary service and not very friendly staff either."
2024-02-19,10,10,"""I like flying this airline""",✅ Trip Verified | Pleasant flight which operated on time. Check-in at Changi was smooth and assistance given to me since I didn’t know how to use the check-in kiosk and bag drop. Lunch was provided onboard and advanced special meal requests were catered for appropriately. I like flying this airline.
2024-02-18,4,4,"""left me deeply disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation, having secured a connecting flight ticket from Penang to Singapore, and then onwards to Jakarta. Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean. I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress."
2024-02-17,10,10,"""can’t fault a single aspect""","✅ Trip Verified |  No queue at check-in, and boarding at the gate was done in an orderly fashion by zones. Pleasant greeting from crew on boarding. The flight was full but cabin crew worked hard to serve lunch to everyone satisfactorily. Great inflight entertainment options for a short-haul flight— far better than any equivalent flights available within Europe for example. Flight landed on time, disembarkation was quick and luggage delivered to the belt quickly as well. I can’t fault a single aspect of the flight."
2024-02-17,10,10,"""No complaints at all""",✅ Trip Verified | Competitive pricing on this route. Service is reliable and friendly. Flight was on time and all aspects went smoothly. No complaints at all and would recommend to others.
2024-02-16,10,10,“I was impressed”,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying on a regional Singapore Airlines flight on a narrow-bodied aircraft since the old subsidiary Silk Air was absorbed by the parent carrier, and I was impressed. Everything went well on the flight, from boarding, to exemplary behaviour and courtesy shown by the cabin crew, to the food and boarding process at Changi airport. The inflight entertainment provided was the full product used for their long haul flights — amazing!"
2024-02-16,10,10,“Superb service”,✅ Trip Verified | Superb service even in economy class. Nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew. Good food and plentiful. Ample choice of entertainment. Flight departed late but still arrived a little early. Boarding at Heathrow was a little chaotic however.
2024-02-16,2,2,"""regional seat was really uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | I was one of the last business class passengers to board, Went to my seat and no offer of pre departure drinks or hot towel. Japanese FA came to me and confirmed my meal order and informed me lunch service would start around 1130am. We took off about 0830am, after takeoff lights were dimmed and nothing was offered. From the time the aircraft took off to the start of lunch service around 11am I did not see crew in the cabin and nothing was offered for 2 1/2 hours. Lunch started with a drink order of orange juice. What came was a syrupy kind of orange drink like cordial. Meal service was fine but this set of crew was just not SQ standard. The regional seat was really uncomfortable and cramped. I did not like it and prefer the older long haul seat."
2024-02-09,10,10,“no problems whatsoever”,"Not Verified | The flight is very smooth sailing, no problems whatsoever and the cabin crews are very friendly and helpful with great hospitality. The pre booked meals are very delicious and well cooked, I couldn’t have asked for a better airline than SIA. The seats are very comfortable and relaxing, it's even better when it’s been converted to a bed and plenty of space and privacy with better comfort. I hope to one day fly with this very amazing again."
2024-02-01,8,8,"""crew serving business disappeared""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Perth to Hong Kong via Singapore on SQ226/896 business class on 17/18 January. The first sector was faultless, the crew attentive, no rush with the meal service and a crew member always wandering around the business cabin checking on passengers, topping up drinks etc. magnificent. The next sector started well with friendly and attentive crew, however, after the meal service the entire crew serving business disappeared and were only seen if the bell was rung! A shame because this now seems to be the norm. Rush the meals, dim the lights and hide!"
2024-01-29,2,2,"""agent took out travel insurance on my behalf""","✅ Trip Verified | For my final trip booked for July 2024, Singapore cancelled my return flight from Istanbul to Sydney. Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another."
2024-01-25,10,10,"""one of the best flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Booked a wheelchair service from Milan to Bangkok. Apart from a slight mishap in Singapore this was one of the best flights I have ever had. The quality of the service was outstanding. Crew worked throughout unlike many European airlines, with great attentiveness. I know because I never sleep. The quality of the food was superb. From my experience both Singapore airlines and Thai have the best training I have come across. Very good entertainment system with many choices. As a yearly flyer there is nothing better than having a long flight where everything works smoothly and people care about you. I can only say thank you. I appreciate your hard work. I will be flying with you again later this year."
2024-01-19,10,10,“received amazing support”,"✅ Trip Verified | I initially booked two separate flights for this airline in November. The first was a LHR-SIN-LHR flight and another was a SIN-MNL-SIN flight. To cut the story short, I requested to rebook my LHR-SIN flight two weeks ahead of my scheduled flight due to a family bereavement and I needed to be in the Philippines. Despite my personal situation, I received an amazing support from the Customer Service team, who happily reorganised my flight, connected my 2 flight bookings so I can get to Manila on time, and without rebooking fees. At the London airport, I was sent-off warmly by the ground staff who has empathised with me as I check-in and ensure I was boarded comfortably in the plane. These gestures of goodwill and support made me grateful for Singapore Airlines. Even though I am no longer based in Singapore, I will always find a way to fly with them. Thank you. These words are never enough for the outstanding, grateful and sincere help you have provided me."
2024-01-18,2,2,"""not fly with them in the future""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty."
2024-01-16,1,1,"""Barely any room to move""","✅ Trip Verified |  Barely any room to move, woke up to getting my knee crushed from the passenger in front of me reclining there seat back and was told it’s within their right to do so. Would not recommend flying economy with them if you are 6ft or taller."
2024-01-12,9,9,“outstanding service”,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew on A52 from Singapore to Manchester on the 10 January. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent in providing outstanding service. Food and drinks were plentiful and of very high quality. My only issue was the seating which I found to be uncomfortable, but other than that the flight was superb. Very highly recommended."
2024-01-08,10,10,"""brilliant experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Checkin and immigration entry at Changi Airport a breeze, all completed and straight to Business Lounge within 5-10 minutes, Lovely and comfortable lounge at T3 with a vast array of food and beverages. Flight left slightly late due to operational issues but pre flight champagne was served and we were then on our way. I elected to have a meal upon departure ( as this was a 1am flight, but you can elect to have served 2 hours prior to arrival) and was served a very tasty steak and vegetables with some lovely french red wine. Staff then prepared lie down bed for a sleep which was bliss after a long day. Staff very courteous and professional as always , a reasonwhy I will continue to use SQ for all travel given the brilliant experience with this great airline, everytime."
2024-01-07,8,8,"""best alongside Qatar Airways""","Not Verified |   There's a reason why Singapore keep winning awards - AKL to BKK and then return BKK to AKL via SIN. Pretty much faultless service from one doorstep to the other. Great aircraft, crew, service, food, facilities, lounges, all on time. Sad to say the only faults lay with Auckland airport and its baggage handlers etc. Well done Singapore airlines, I've flown BC long haul with Qatar Airways and Malaysia Airlines this year as well, and SIA is the best alongside Qatar Airways."
2023-12-31,1,1,"""allocated us three different seats""","✅ Trip Verified | We booked our ticket well in advance for our return trip from India from CCU to Perth via Singapore and after few days SIA changed the flight timing later, from originally scheduled 7.40am to 7.20am. We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA."
2023-12-27,2,2,"""Deficient reservation system""","Not Verified | We made a Phuket-Singapore round trip which was exemplary, from punctuality to welcome, including the food and drinks offered (Business Class). On the other hand, wishing to make a new reservation, it was impossible to pay online, as I had done previously, and despite around ten calls directly to Singapore (but visibly diverted to other call centers). The employees have nothing to do with it, they follow a protocol, but after 6 hours of attempts, I still haven't been able to pay my ticket. Deficient reservation system, friendly employees but very limited in their knowledge of their reservation system, impossible to reach a manager and promise of a solution in 72 hours. A real shame for an expensive company that claims to be among the best in the world. Nous avons fait un aller-retour Phuket-Singapore qui était exemplaire, de la ponctualité à l'accueil, en passant par les mets et boissons offerts ( Classe affaire ). Par contre, souhaitant effectuer une nouvelle réservation, impossible de payer en ligne, comme je l'avais fait précédemment, et malgré une dizaine d'appels directement à Singapour ( mais visiblement déviés sur d'autres centrales d'appel ). Les employés n'y sont pour rien, ils suivent un protocole, mais après 6 heures de tentatives, je n'ai toujours pas mon pu payer mon billet. Système de réservation déficient, employés sympathique mais très limités dans leurs connaissance de leur système de réservation, impossible d'atteindre un responsable et promesse d'une solution dans..... 72 heures. Une véritable honte pour une compagnie chère qui se prétend parmi les meilleures du monde."

They suggest swapping my itinerary to one day earlier to SQ127 result long layover time in SIN and aircraft change from Boeing 737-8 to Boeing 737-800NG for real was ex-MI aircraft.
2023-12-18,2,2,“flight delayed almost 4 hours”,"Not Verified | The flight was delayed for almost 4 hours. The flight was supposed to be 605pm but only departed at about 950pm. It was only informed to us after we checked in and completed our immigration customs check. We have to wait for so many hours in the restricted areas. We booked this airline only instead of budget airlines only because we thought their flights is known to be punctual. But we were wrong. Moreover, the meal provided is a slice of pizza and exactly the same as the meal that was provided when we took the flight from Singapore to Penang. We are expecting at least some changes in the meal. This is really disappointing, that such arrangement is coming from a world class top airlines. There were also no instructions in the flight or emails to instruct you how to get the wifi service up. There was also no inflight entertainment system or even an earpiece for audio music."
2023-12-17,7,7,"""I slept better than in economy""","✅ Trip Verified | Book the cook worked well, my seatmate got economy food. There was a bottle of water in every seat, good wifi connectivity. Wines are offered. Frankfurt to Singapore as I moved my seat to bulkhead 25 hours before flying, somehow this messes up the book the cook. So I had eco food. They were apologetic and I received voucher to redeem. I slept better than in economy, and I didn't have swollen leg! I used to try to score business class seat in flights > 10 hours due to my leg tends to swell. But prices now are horrendously expensive. Singapore Airlines premium economy already good enough for my leg."
2023-12-17,1,1,"""customer service is a nightmare""",✅ Trip Verified | The customer service is a nightmare. I have spent days on the phone since I booked my flight 2 months ago. I booked a flex fare to be able to reschedule my flight but the homepage is not working - same as the staff on the phone that tells me a different story about why I cannot reschedule every time. Never again.
2023-12-11,1,1,“No inflight entertainment at all”,"Not Verified | No inflight entertainment at all. Yes, we are talking about Singapore Airlines. Please send your staff to rate the flight from Singapore to Penang, during my flight from Penang to Singapore, the entire aircraft is super hot. I am wondering is sq providing a free sauna to their passengers during seating until the flight takes off, only then do they provide air conditioning. Don't just rate their long distance flight. Please go ahead and try out their short distance. They do have WIFI on, but unusable."
2023-12-09,8,8,"""easy, comfortable experience""","✅ Trip Verified | The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane. Meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. Choose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with Singapore Airlines made it an easy, comfortable experience. I would highly recommend."
2023-11-28,10,10,“Above and beyond”,Not Verified | We flew on SQ285 on 22/11/23 - great flight and service from the pilot to the hostesses. In the terminal we were blessed with the assistance on Punitha Maniam checking us in who spotted an issue with one of our NZ visas. Punitha took the trouble to re-apply on an express approval application on our behalf including follow up phone calls to ensure we had approval. Punitha thank you so much for being you and helping us as I am sure you would for all your customers. Above and beyond the only way to describe you!
2023-11-24,1,1,"""delayed 24 hours in September 2023""","✅ Trip Verified | It appears that Singapore Airlines slogan ""Placing you at the heart of everything we do"", only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints about delays quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and are still waiting for the airline to comply with UK civil aviation authority compensation rules."
2023-11-21,1,1,“they have not followed through”,"Not Verified | Flight delayed out of Singapore. Luggage didn’t make it on the flight. Said it would be delivered the next day! It has not! I’m completely canceling plans tomorrow to go 3 hrs round trip to get luggage myself, as I fly back to the states the next day. For being called the best airline in the world, I have experienced the most irresponsible service. They said they would do one thing and they have not followed through."
2023-11-20,6,6,“not the Singapore Airlines I know!”,"✅ Trip Verified | I used Singapore Airlines on 10 flights during September and October between the UK and different Asian destinations, I have used Singapore many times maintaining Kris flyer Gold Status for some years. During my recent flights I used economy, premium economy and business class, the flights were okay nothing spectacular but probably the biggest take away was the poor service on just about every flight apart from 1. Ranging from missed food to dreadful food, just not the Singapore Airlines I know! I used SQ for the consistency of service which is not after COVID not the same, I know many airlines have suffered from experience leaving the work place, but Singapore crew service and consistency are it's trade mark. I travel to South East Asia a lot from both Europe & South Africa so Singapore figured in my travel plans a lot, I will probably use them again in the future but in the meantime I have gone to an alternative for my next round of flights. I would recommend Singapore on some routes simply because the competition is poor."
2023-11-18,1,1,"""Never again Singapore Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won’t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn’t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this “interrogation“ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn’t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents' actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines."
2023-11-18,9,9,"""Food was excellent""",✅ Trip Verified | Just a short 2 hour flight. Food was excellent - had the Pre-Order Butter Chicken. Staff were efficient. Comfy seat but no time to relax back and enjoy. No issues and would fly again.
2023-11-18,9,9,"""An excellent experience""",✅ Trip Verified | An excellent experience. Food was simply terrific (Pan Seared Salmon) and plenty of Drink on offer. Service was Friendly and Efficient. I got a good 7 hours of sleep laid out flat. Also used their complimentary WiFi without any issues.
2023-11-17,4,4,"""SQ has not provided any explanation""","✅ Trip Verified |   We were booked on Business from Johannesburg to Singapore in October and was asked to provide the credit card used to purchase the ticket for my husband’s ticket some 11 months ago. Apparently this was flagged by SQ system at checkin and we need to provide said credit card for checkin staff to scan into SQ system in order to allow us to get his boarding pass. Otherwise we need to sign an indemnity form or risk denied boarding. Fortunately, I did have the credit card used 11 months ago when I booked his flight or both of us would end up in Johannesburg stranded! Reason offered: 1. Fraud detection systems picked this up based off determined parameters. When I challenged this because 11 months SQ would have been paid in full and their ERP system should have the information. 2. Next explanation: within a 12- hour period we charged many transactions on card. When I provided the data which showed we never charged anything within 12 hour either before or after . 3. Their system algorithm is correct in picking this up as “fraud” and good for customer! Empty assurance of prevention when SQ has not provided any explanation how this event was picked up! I am still waiting for someone more senior to pick this up… Interested to ensure that this will not happen to any other passengers who booked tickets at least 3 months in advance of travel date let alone one year ago!"
2023-11-15,4,4,"""Very poor service""","Not Verified | Very poor service, was told not to take my cabin luggage onto business class, but all the bags in the plane including economy were bigger. Cabin crew brought the wrong dinner and basically told me to eat it, only replaced when I did not. Seat not able to got flat, very poor seating configuration for someone over 6’."
2023-11-06,10,10,"""great choices of movies""","✅ Trip Verified | The best airline I've flown. The windows shades are automatic dark, automatic colors. The aircraft is big with many lavatories. Wifi is working for Krisflyer members and its free. The IFE is also working with great choices of movies and tv shows and a usb port provided. The breakfast was also great."
2023-11-04,1,1,"""only offered an option of fish or vegetarian""","✅ Trip Verified | We were booked in on seat numbers 62j to 62k as a family of four. At the time of the meals, when requested for a chicken meal we were only offered an option of fish or vegetarian. As there was no chicken available, my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal, as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want, and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on check-in were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals."
2023-11-03,1,1,"""tell me that they cannot find my luggage""",✅ Trip Verified | They never placed my 2 bags on my flights from Rome to Singapore and onto Penang. I have airtags and the app shows exactly where they are and Singapore Airlines refuses to use this information and continues to tell me that they cannot find my luggage. I am stranded in Penang with only the clothes on my back. They have completely destroyed this travel experience. I attach a pic of where my bags currently are at Rome airport!
2023-11-01,1,1,"""refused to compensate the costs""","✅ Trip Verified | Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly re-assigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval; SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was re=assigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone. The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred."
2023-10-27,1,1,"""disastrous layover in Singapore""","✅ Trip Verified | I am submitting this review about a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines wherein my family were subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused them to miss their connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. The delay according to Singapore Airlines was caused by traffic control between Guangzhou and Singapore and the plane had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur to refuel for more than 2 hours on the tarmac. We missed the connecting flight SQ38 on August 9th to LAX as a result. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as logically delayed passengers who miss a connecting flights after a certain time should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention. When I brought this up to an SQ customer service supervisor after spending hours on call trying to reach someone who I could speak to about this, I was shocked and concerned to find out that not even supervisor level reps knew about one of the most important international passenger rights conventions. SQ repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to brush me off. Currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and World's Best Airline reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore."
2023-10-26,7,7,"""It was a good flight""",✅ Trip Verified | It was a good flight. I would have given a full 10 on 10 review but because of the seats I ain't that satisfied. Business class seats should have been more comfortable when travelling long haul flights.
2023-10-24,10,10,"""crew was really courteous and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Having flown with a few middle east carriers throughout this route, definitely I was putting a high expectations from this SQ flight. Got the best price compare with another middle eastern carriers with extra 300 AED for extra 5kgs checked in luggage. The check in process was smooth and I was lucky enough to get upgraded to premium eco seat from SIN to CGK. The DXB to SIN flight was really bumpy, but the crew was really courteous and helpful throughout the flight. The food was definitely better than the middle eastern carriers and also free wifi was a nice touch comparing to any other airlines. The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers). Good job SQ."
2023-10-24,9,9,"""Cabin crew were very nice and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | There was nothing special at Frankfurt airport pre-departure. It was good when we got onboard. The seat on SQ 777-300ER is similar to that on the A350-900ULR, meaning it is spacious and comfortable. Catering from Frankfurt was excellent, and I liked all the dishes served, especially the satay (I heard the satay was brought from Singapore, but I was not sure). Cabin crew were very nice and helpful, as expected from SQ."
2023-10-22,1,1,"""an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack""","✅ Trip Verified | The airline's check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible."
2023-10-19,3,3,"""The meals are low quality""","✅ Trip Verified | Although the aircraft is good with flat beds and the crew is good, the onboard selection of entertainment does not compare to other airlines. The meals are low quality for Business class. Also I find the seats not as comfortable as others."
2023-10-08,1,1,"""charged me a cancellation fee of US$200""","✅ Trip Verified | I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided."

We had one oversize package, namely a painting rolled and contained in a tube. We were not sure what to do with it as it was very light but more than a meter long. The staff at the Adelaide airport have done their utmost to help us, they contacted the baggage people, took the tube to them and then dispatched it for us! Amazing. Then on board they welcomed us as if we were long lost friends. Hats off to the crew of Flight. SQ 278 on the 19 Sep."

A huge thank you to the chief air hostess and to the crew.
2023-09-23,5,5,"""no better than Economy fare""","✅ Trip Verified | We were given a flight with Scoot from Bangkok to Singapore, and then with Singapore to Auckland. The flight with Scoot was perfectly acceptable but what was not was that they decided that we must collect our boarding pass in Singapore which might have been OK but they they never told us where to collect them from, so we we spent ages trying to find the location and only just made it to the gate in time. The previous leg from Milan to Hanoi involved a Scoot flight and we received all our passes in Milan. On the flight when meals were served the crew just appeared at the seat with a tray whilst we were dozing and expected us to put out the table. As we had ordered book the cook, the main meal service took a while and we had finished our meal before drinks were offered. Premium economy food was no better than Economy fare and considering the cost of the flight a little more thought could have gone into the meal."
2023-09-19,1,1,"""Do your own check in online""","Not Verified | We flew an itinerary Melbourne to Dubai return via Singapore in August 2023. We joined their Krisflyer membership. Having done that, we opted in for their ""Auto Check In"" for each flight. Singapore Airlines automatically check you in and email your printable boarding passes 24 hours before each flight departure. You do not have to check yourself in online. Our flights and seating for MEL-Singapore, Singapore-Dubai, Dubai_Singapore we were auto checked in and I printed the boarding passes at the hotel each time. But, while staying in Singapore for 2 days prior to our flight, 24 hours before our SIN-MEL flight, I kept checking my emails for the auto check in. By 1pm, 12 hours before our midnight SQ237 flight I received no auto check in. I knew something was wrong. I called their Singapore call centre and quoted my SQ RES Number, and said I have not received our boarding passes. For no reason, they hung up. I re-dialed the number, another operator, same thing, they hung up. On the third attempt the first thing I said to the operator ""Do not hang up"" I gave my REF booking number and we had pre-allocated seats 41D and 41E. The operator said ""I cannot find this REF number"". I patiently said, "" Go to SQ237 seats 41D&41E you will see our names on those seats."" Nothing. I started to get distressed but kept my cool. I said ""If we go to the Airport they can sort it out"". No. you are not on that flight. So, I said, "" what do we do?"" He told us we have to re-book the same flight for the next day and pay an extra re-booking fee of $430. At that moment I thought, we just have to get on a flight, book it and work out the problem later. I looked up the seating on my ipad as he was doing the re-booking and requested the vacant seats, 70B&70C. He told me they are not available and put us in a three row on 46DEF. We went to the hotel lobby and booked an extra night at$353. We got to the airport 9 hours before our flight at 3pm, and showed them our paper itinerary at check in and said we did not receive an auto check in email or boarding passes and that 70B&70C are in fact available, and yes they were. Do your own check in online. I am in the process of filing both a complaint and claim to Singapore Airlines."

2023-09-18,6,6,"""I found the seats a bit uncomfortable""","Not Verified | I use Singapore Airlines a lot so obviously like the airline, and having Gold Frequent filer status does help when flying economy. fast track check in and lounge access to make things a bit smoother. I fly economy on Singapore Airlines but this was the first time in economy on a SQ long haul flight for about 6 years. Boarding was fine, quickly to my seat 45A, departed a little late but once in the air for around 1 hour service was started. Crew where okay food served quickly and again nothing special just okay. The flight lasting 12 hours passed fairly quick, I found the seats a bit uncomfortable after 4 or 5 hours, the crew where around a little bit and the 2nd meal served 3 hours prior to arrival was okay. Connecting to Bangkok pretty easy and the 2 hour uneventful flight on a new 787 was pretty nice. Returning Check in at Bangkok was quick security and immigration done quickly too, used the Krisflier lounge which was pretty nice, the flight to SIN I was seated in seat 42A, food and drinks where offered but the crew after requesting my choice forgot to deliver the food or a drink, It was a bit odd and the crew on this flight where actually a bit rude anyway. Connection in SIN good again, my flight back to London in Premium Economy, so a chance to compare. Yes of course we are paying for the space, but food and crew are the same as economy. Premium Economy wise I think SQ is okay, I will continue to use, because it's normally consistent but there are better and much cheaper Premium Economy options around."
2023-09-17,10,10,"""consideration and rapid response""","✅ Trip Verified | My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation, they generously credited me my miles back so we can re-book our trip at a later date. To me, this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles, but they did. I have flown Singapore for years, even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, consideration and rapid response. Thank you."
