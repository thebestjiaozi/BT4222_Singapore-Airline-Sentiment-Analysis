"5755","Highlight of Singapore Airlines - Good flight and great service My Husband and I have always enjoyed Singapore Airlines good service. Airline crew are diligent and ready to assist. Clean and comfortable seats, inflight entertainment was of quality as well.","positive"
"7042","Perfect Service Headphone on seat not working but staff did everthing to fix it + offered different seat and ask other guest to change so we could change together. Overall meals can be rated as good. Bit strange just socks and no amenity kit in prem. eco. but sleeping mask and ear butts been available on request (thanks to staff again). THis was needed due to 2 chinese ladys which had just to much red wine during flight","positive"
"2696","Highly overrated and overpriced airline I recently flew Singapore. It is not my preferred airline but have to fly them sometimes. I have had four bad experiences in around 15 round trip business class flights in asia pacific over the past 3 years with them, which is roughly 1 in 4 flights. In flight service is getting worse and I think some of their flight attendants need to be grounded and sent to training again. Given they are ranked number 1, their custormer service too is so stuffed up with bloated egos and doesnt listen whether it be to do with poor inflight service, poor quality of food, some basic common sense or bags not being delivered. What they dont realise is that is how the best and the might fall. When one stops listening.","negative"
"8507","Lackluster Premium Economy & Service Similar to the outbound flight from SIN to DUS, I found the seat to be quite dirty. On the outgoing flight, there were lots of breadcrumbs on the seat and I have to sweep it off with my bare hands. On the returning flight, there are chocolate ice cream stains on the seat belt. The A350 also seems like a a very narrow aircraft and every time when the stewardess push her trolley and enter the Premium Economy cabin from Economy Cabin, it almost certainly hit my seat (being seated in the last row, middle aisle of the cabin). Service, probably the worst I have experienced taking SIA flights. The stewardess serving my cabin/row seems almost uninterested and have a forceful smile on most occasion. She certainly doesn't seem like she wants to be on the flight and working. Another leading stewardess was also quite rude when I was asking for drinks while she was 'clearing', citing to me that she was clearing and in the end I told her, never mind, I will just walk back to get it myself. Do remember the galley is at the end of the plane and Premium Economy passengers literally have to walk all the way to use toilet, get things etc. as there are no galley and toilets in this A350 aircraft in the middle (excluding business class). Catering was also less than impressive. The portion was also very small, and served in disposable plastic ware. The menu selection are also very similar or almost identical to the several flights I have taken the past one year with SIA. The only difference for Premium Economy for this leg is you get a croissant instead of a roll, and Ben & Jerry ice cream. Unless you need to get off the plane real quick (but yet unable to afford business), or must really love croissant and Ben and Jerry ice cream, then I don't think Premium Economy is necessary. There are also more competitive Premium Economy out there with some airlines offering lounge access, amenity kit, glassware dining etc. I certainly do not see the value proposition and added comfort for this product on SIA and particularly on this route. I would still recommend SIA though, but just maybe not Premium Economy on this route.","neutral"

"2390","The best, even in coach I first flew Singapore Airlines in 1994, Business Class, from Los Angeles to Hanoi. It never got any better than that. They now fly from Houston to Singapore, by way of Manchester, a flight I took on my way to Aberdeen but this time in Coach. The flight was great. The equipment in excellent condition, the service superb, even the food was good and a step above anything I've had in coach anywhere else. Very highly recomended!","positive"
"2117","First time First time we used SA. Probably best airline I’ve ever used. Staff unbelievably helpful and friendly, especially with kids, wanting to know age and first names etc. Airbus (sorry but it’s the single storey wide body) was new and spotless. Food reasonable as it was principally aimed at final destination it filled a void. Good choice of in flight entertainment for such a long flight (12 hours). Attendants couldn’t do enough for you.","positive"
"10061","My daughter and I flew Singapore Airlines on our trip to Khao Lak in Thailand. We decided to go for what we thought was a reputable airline so we could have an enjoyable journey. We booked early and selected our seats, as we both had mild anxiety and medical conditions which necessitated a seat near the bathrooms. On our return flight there was a delay with flights which resulted in missing our flight from Singapore to Melbourne. We were placed on the next available flight, which was about 3 hours later. There were about 60 people in the same situation I was told, so there was a lot of chaos in getting new boarding passes, etc. We had no say in the seats which we placed in and of course they ended up being in the middle seat of the middle aisle. My daughter was extremely stressed as she was placed between two elderly people with mobility issues, and was not easily able to access the bathroom. The flight was initially very hot until they eventually managed to adjust the air conditioning. We were entitled to have an evening meal, but the only food we received was a pizza slice and breakfast. We ended up paying for a service which we didn't receive. I did write to Singapore Airlines and received the usual spiel about caring about customers","negative"

"7649","Excellent service Impressed with the service by 3 lovely Japanese stewardess on flight sq11 on 11th Dec led by a Singaporean chief stewardess Evon. They were very alert and always service with a big bright smile. So courteous and polite. Could also pre amp what we would like, e.g. refills, blankets, cuppa tea etc. It's been a long while since I've been impressed by this airline and this trip made the difference. Keep up the good work SIA.","positive"
"3300","Long flight down under I flew recently to Sydney from Manchester! It involves 2 flights, first into Singapore then from Singapore to Sydney! The aircraft was on time, clean which was Good. The staff however were wonderful, they were attentive throughout both flights, nothing was too much trouble, they were lovely!! Food was great much better than some airlines I have travelled !! The only negative I have and out of 4 flight(!2 there and 2 back) was on the flight from Manchester to Singapore the cabin was too cold, I had to ask stewardess if had some socks and the lady requested a second blanket, so I would advise to make sure you have socks in your bag if you are travelling barefoot, but to be fair this is tiny negative!! I would highly recommend SingaporeAirlines as they are amazing, only wished had more time in Singapore as departure lounge was amazing and so easy to transit onto next flight . I would of loved to of seen the city, next time for sure !!","positive"

"6439","Suite class simply sweet! Flew to Singapore from Auckland on SQ286 recently. I was in Seat 3F which is a window seat. I wish to commend the inflight crew, Raffee and Grace for their warm and attentive service. The hardware was great (the flat bed of the Suite class is so much more comfortable than the Business class flat bed) but it’s SQ’s software that sets her apart from her competitors.","positive"
"1999","New to long haul travel I am overweight and wide of backside. A UK size 20. So booked PE. Leg room was good and seat was just wide enough. The gadgets for tv and moving the chair were akward to get to. The staff were nice and attentive on both flights. The food was a mix of tasty (lamb curry was yummie) but starters yukkie and bread a bit blah. Drinks and snacks available. Toilets mainly clean but small. I sat in 31C near a door and it was very noisey. I did not realise planes could be so loud on inside. Had ear plugs and their earphones on but the engine noise kept me awake throughout the journey. I will need to buy my own earphones if I travel again. So my review is midpoint as I dont know much about flying. My fault I am a fatty but still felt cramped and paid well over £2000 for flight.","neutral"
"5203","Perfect service and timely arrival and departure Brand new aircraft. Good leg space and also comfortable. Fresh and good toilets with all modern facilities. Crew was good. Only that I had to ask them several times for a head phone which goes over the ear. They did not give and I had to take my kid's one. They provided a small activity kit to my kid and he was happy with it. Beverages were served through out. Perfect service and timely arrival and departure. We got the middle seats hence could not get any views.","positive"

"3950","The good and bad of business Our plane was the A350-900, fairly new and comfortable seating, but a bit tight with the leg room when trying to sleep on a long haul I felt. The food choices were good, if a little sparse for business class, and the drink selection as per usual was very good. Found the entertainment choice not as good as it had been on other flights, must have been a quiet time at the box office. This leads me to the age old question of what to do on a flight which has young children on it, like ours did, and who are restless to the extreme with continuous crying causing a lack of sleep for everyone. No real answer to that problem is there, as we all paid the same money to be there, it just kind of spoilt the trip for us who are light sleepers. Headphones and alcohol only go halfway to solving the problem, and the staff seemed powerless. As we landed, both children slept the sleep of innocents!","neutral"
"6984","Smooth and comfortable Two long flights 10 hours London to Singapore and then 13 onward to New Zealand. Whole flight experience was efficient, comfortable with good service throughout. Fair selection of movies, good entertainment system with noise cancelling headphones. Food and beverages also of z good standard.","positive"
"8402","World's Longest Flight... but calmest experience My outbound to NYC was premium and return was business. It was comfortable both ways. My return on business definitely helped in reducing my 12 hour jetlag (which is worse when you come east). The SIngapore airlines service, was as always, immaculate. Always helpful, calm and smiling. Food was fine. There are only 2 full meal services for the 18 hour flight in business class which i think should be revised to 3. However there are various snacks and wraps option that you can ask for any time during your flight (and this is true for both classes). The cabin is very functional - nothing luxurious - but benefits from high ceilings (it really helps). Overall, i would definitely do it again rather than taking a stopover flight. At Newark, Singapore shares the lounge with Virgin. Whilst the quality of the lounge is great, i understand it would be extremely crowded on days of a full flight and timing clash.","positive"
"10110","Really satisfied with the quality and service with Singapore Airlines. Flew from the UK to Australia, and there was no problems or issues on the way. Food and IFE was above par, and the cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Would fly with them again.","positive"
"69","Great overall experience with multi stop European flights Great airline. We flew Brisbane to Amsterdam and then from Munich to Brisbane with a stopover in Singapore. Food on all flights was generous in serving size and delicious (for airplane food). The planes themselves were a bit of a mix. Some more modern than others but they did the job and all had relatively comfortable seats in economy. Flights left on time from each destination. Entertainment options were varied and free wifi much appreciated with free Krisflyer membership. Overall very happy.","positive"
"2477","Excellent service as always As always, excellent service throughout. Had 3 kids with me and we could select a kids meal for them which was very appetizing. Kids also had a free gift onboard which kept them occupied on top of the great selection of movies and games inflight!","positive"
"5560","The Boy From Forres Absolutely 1st class service even in the Economy section of the plane, We flew London London - Singapore then onto Tokyo and the same on the way back. Food, Snacks, Drinks and Entertainment were superb and with proper cutlery. Staff on all flights were fantastic and couldn't do enough for you. We had a 5 hour stopover in Singapore on our way home and best Airport I have ever been in with loads to do. All in all Singapore airlines in my opinion would take some something special to beat them for service.","positive"
"5960","Excellent Service and on time We flew economy from Perth to Singapore with short layover then to Amsterdam. Tgen ftom Milan to Singapore then Perth.

"6077","WHEN YOU ARE GOOD First time we flew on the Singapore airline was 42 years ago, and they were one of the best airlines then, better than Pan Am. We were on our Far East trip from Toronto. All the airlines that we flew on before and since cannot hold a candle to them. The staff knew how to treat the passengers, the food was excellent and it made the flight memorable. Glad to hear that they have not lost the touch. On the way back from Bangkok, there was a frightening news on the radio. A Canadian couple was being sort after by the Interpol/RCMP etc. for murdering tourists travelling the Far East, to get their cash, passports and belongings. The passangers","positive"
"1303","Great airline. Good pricing for a full service airline. Great service, great plane, great pricing. We chose Singapore as we got excellent pricing for our flights from Brisbane to Istanbul with return flights booked from Amsterdam back to Brisbane. We weren't sure what to expect as when we started our travels, Covid 19 was just emerging. Check in was easy, very friendly service. I was particularly looking forward to experiencing the new A350's Singapore are servicing Brisbane with. I wasn't disappointed, what an excellent airplane. Due to Covid, the plane was very empty so we were able to have 2 rows of 3 seats to ourselves. We were able to spread out and have a great sleep on this leg. The staff on board are excellent and friendly. The seating was good, good room for a 175cm cm male. Food was excellent. The flight was smooth, no issues.","positive"
"6060","Singapore Airlines? NEVER AGAIN We were excited at the prospect of flying Business Class. We departed LHR at 9.20AM and an hour later offered ""Brunch"". as we had breakfast in the lounge we were not ready for this ""meal"". About 12.30 we asked for some snacks etc and were informed there was no food available and we would get a meal an hour and a half out of Singapore. There was no drinks cart, no water unless we asked and no tea or coffee!!! this 13 hour flight with little drink or food, we were utterly disgusted.. For this we paid $6500 each. Never again. Be warned. The same scenario happened on the Singapore to Brisbane leg, however this trip not as long, but service or rather lack of was the same. So, best airline, i do not think so.!!!!! I need to add that upon return I asked for a refund of the difference between Business and Economy this refused and after much writing and eventually contacting the CEO we were given a cashcard each of $350. no way enough compensation after paying $12,700.","negative"
"10545",". Seoul to Kochi via Singapore. My flight from Kochi to Singapore on SilkAir was very good with enough leg space and tv, food option was just satisfactory, but I appreciate the before flight food pack they gave. Singapore to Seoul was okay, almost on par with Kochi to Singapore but bigger flight (I found silk air have better leg space than Singapore airlines. But return was very disappointing. Seoul to Singapore things except food was on par, but cabin crew was rushing, they gave me less than 2 min to use wet wipes and was eager to collect it back even before I used. Singapore to India worst service, even before they start they were left with veg food and non veg food they asked me but I didn't get it, though my seat was in 1st 15 seats. Toilet just a pair of toilet at back and front toilet though free reserved for business class seats, they didn't let me use it as economy class passenger. There was no TV on return flight and used mobile app to view their movies, limited food option and lack of consistency in service makes me not go on this airline unless to a route that has Singapore as destination for good service and flights are generally scheduled for it Air Asia though less options has better food choices or at least 1-2 very good choices to buy. Advantages Flight Date change possible for very low fee, which I did. Luggage 30kg very useful. Very quick service Definitely gives 6-10 rating no comparison to other top airlines.","neutral"

"9860","Singapore airlines flight to start our holiday. So many positives for this airline. I was very happy with the flight crew service and friendless but the seating in the Boeing 777 ER was terrible. I’m 5’7” so not exceptionally tall but my knees were jammed up against the seat in front and when they reclined I couldn’t move or have my tray table down. I really understand the label “cattle class” my husband was next to a very large gentleman who’s size impinged on his seat space making his trip uncomfortably too Inflight entertainment was good charging port very welcome and food was good. Boarding at Melbourne and disembarking in Singapore was fast and efficient. Disembarking in Amsterdam was very slow and we had to descend down stairs and catch a bus to the terminal buildings. After being crammed into my seat it was hard on the knees. Difficult to give it a rating as so many positives overshadowed by a cramped cabin.","neutral"
"11190","Perth to Singapore. Service from ground and cabin staff was outstanding, the aircraft was well presented. The seat configuration of 2x4x2 is better than 3x3x3 on their Boeing 777 fleet. In my opinion, Singapore Airlines is the best airline.","positive"
"4882","SQ235 top notch comfort and food The flight home from Singapore was actually enjoyable! Seats were comfortable and easy to sleep in, entertainment and sound was fantastic. The food and service was also top notch. The only negative was that dinner service took such a long time (a large business section on the new A350-900) so I didn’t get as much sleep as I’d have liked to. I would definitely recommend.","positive"
"3821","Return from Oz Having been away for 6 great weeks the trip home was going to be a bit flat so we decided to go Premium economy. As I am over 6 feet tall I was looking forward to the extra leg room but that turned out to be only one of the benefits. The seats were more comfortable and wider in a 2 4 2 format and had footrests, the food was very good and the service excellent. The ear phones and screens were also of a better standard.","positive"
"9215","Excellent in every respect Every aspect of our flight was exceptional. The Flight Attendants were very polite and helpful. The food was good with variety of choices.. We would definitely choose to fly with Silkair and Singapore Airlines from Cairns to London. Paul & Jenny","positive"
"6505","Premium Economy definitely worth it Although not perfect, it was pretty good. Boarding was slightly confusing, though on PE you do board early. There is a good amount of room and sleep is possible with the seat fully reclined, this doesn't affect too much the seat behind. We found the pre ordered food excellent in general with only one dish being slightly dry. The only disadvantage of the Book the Cook service is that you are served first without the bar service, but they will bring you a drink if you ask. Stewards and stewardesses mostly excellent, very responsive and friendly. Time passed relatively quickly and I would recommend to anyone.","positive"
"5583","SQ A350 I find the economy seat is smaller than other airlines A350. I’m consider petite and I’m already don’t find comfortable sitting in such a confine space for 13hrs. I have such issue with other airlines A350 though.","negative"

The hype has always been about the superior premium offerings from the airlines. But the service and experience of flying in Singapore airlines economy was brilliant. Loved every bit of it, from the service to the food, to the inflight meals and inflight entertainment; it was worth it. The stop over at Singapore is great as well, would be even better if they could go easy on the stop over visa charges. But overall its one of the best in economy travel.","positive"

"11009","Melbourne to Amsterdam via Singapore. Legroom is comparable with other good economy class airlines, but they are wider which makes a difference. They are comfortable, everything works - meals, drink service, food service, punctuality. Singapore Airlines can make a reasonably good economy experience by being friendly, attentive and active when serving customers. Even the food was good for economy, while maintaining simplicity. It was 24 hours from Melbourne to Amsterdam and I don't feel tired or washed out on arrival - had a good sleep on both legs. It's worth that little extra expense and Singapore Airport is the best to kill time in. The business class looked fabulous, but their premium economy didn't seem that impressive as I walked past it.","positive"

I called their local number many times and get immediate the recorded message that the waiting time was more than 1 hour then they asked for a pin number which I have no clue what they are talking about. In any case, I tried many times and waited on the phone for hours and no agent answered. I sent them many emails and I got the automatic acknowledgment they received my email, but no one answered my email.

Their various industry awards and accolades annually, indeed attest that Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly. From purchasing airtickets on their App, up until our timely arrival back to Singapore, the entire journey was seamless and smooth. From Singapore Changi Airport, we had departed on time. Check-in via their App or on-line, was a breeze. We enjoyed impeccable, attentive and efficient service from their staff. During the 14 hours flight to London (13 hours back to Singappre), we were served 2 hot meals, snacks, and they constantly plied us with beverages to stay hydrated throughout our flight. We also enjoyed hot towels, twice. We had a choice of 2 to 3 different meals, each time. Screen size is ample with a dizzying selection of movies, TV and music. We have adequate space and comfortable seats, even in economy class. Despite congestion at Heathrow Airport, we still arrived home to Singapore as per the original scheduled time.

"599","Incompetent check in staff I have been a regular customer of Singapore Airlines for decades and am disappointed to see how much their level of service/ competence has deteriorated during the pandemic. I booked a return flight from Toronto to Singapore from Air Canada (i.e. the marketing carrier). I do have a checked luggage allocation of 3 bags. As per SIAs own baggage policy, the first marketing carrier's baggage policy applies (see picture below). Despite me showing them a copy of their own airline's policy, they were adamant that their policy of 2 bags applies. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is something I've never had to do in my life and a complete hassle. It is also something that I find embarrassing to do. It is really unfortunate that SIA no longer pays any attention to staff training and /or update their publically policies. I have many options when transiting on my frequent travels and will definitely think twice about travelling via Sinagpore in the future. This is not a fake review. My flight number is SQ600 departing at 8am Jan 20 2023.","negative"
"394","World's 2nd Best airline must be a Joke! If there was an option for no stars, I would select that. Singapore Airlines from Bangalore, India to Singapore which was set to depart at 0120 was delayed by ~3 hours. The flight reached Singapore at 1130. Due to this the connecting flight to Perth which was set to depart at 1200 was missed. Due to this I along with my partner had to stay in Singapore city overnight at our own expenses at a hotel. On arrival in Singapore, I inquired with Singapore Airlines Duty Manager on what our options were as our onward journey had been disrupted due to this delay of almost 3 hours to which I was offered no solution at all. In fact, my request was brushed aside by the duty manager based on the fact that I did not have a connecting flight booked with Singapore Airlines or Scoot and that this situation was ""no longer Singapore Airlines Problem"". I explained to the Duty Manager that a missed connection (either with Singapore Airlines group or any other carrier for that matter) put us in a position where we would incur costs associated with accommodation, meals, transport and loss of pay (in my case) to which the duty manager responded that those would have to be borne at my expense even though the delay was caused by a Singapore Airlines. As mentioned earlier, the general gist of the responses I received from the duty manager was that ""this is not our problem"". The treatment meted out to me by a duty manager was sub par to say the least and certainly was not expected from an airline which is considered to be among the best in the world. I even worte to them and they have conveniently told me that I need to check with my insurance company and that they aren't liable.","negative"

Finally I have the chance to try SQ (by luck) and I can say that the service is unbelievably beyond every other airlines. The flight attendants are attentive to every passengers' needs. The service has never stopped. Being offered many times for the delectables that my stomach was full when I landed in Singapore. I have requested for halal meals which taste great and enough portion. Ground staff handling has been helpful. I promise myself, next time, i would again travel with SQ for long flight. My advice is, please provide a bottle of water for every economy passengers, besides water is important for long flights, it also gives easiness for the crew. I am such a water drinker that the crew pushed me for having juice or any others (as part of their hospitality) but NOP, water is just enough!","positive"
"8492","Very Good Service The boarding experience was a bit weird as they didn’t allow checkin before 3 hours. Maybe it’s a airport policy. The flight was good. Service level was good. No issues. They ensure your needs are taken care of nicely. But if you have asked for a special meal the quality is not that good and pretty much same every time and can be a bit boring for the frequent flier. The choice of movies and TV serials especially from Bollywood needs a serious upgrade.","positive"

"10991","Singapore to Jakarta on an A350-900 (9V-SMD). Flight left behind schedule. We waited for like 30+ minutes after scheduled departure time on ground in Singapore before push back to avoid getting trapped in air traffic congestion in Jakarta. Excellent communication from Flight Deck. Flight Attendants on this flight worked hard, providing lunch service with two drink runs on a full flight for such a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). FAs were very cheerful and polite. I pre-ordered in-flight merchandise (aircraft models) and they brought it to me before the flight lands. Aircraft was a new A350, the cabin was bright and airy. and large windows adding to a sense of space. Entertainment using the latest touchscreen which is very easy and fun to use. Only gripe I had was one piece of our luggage was stranded in Singapore and didn't make it on our flight, but after checking with SQ baggage service person in Jakarta we were told that it will arrive on the next flight from Singapore 2.5 hours later. The issue with the delayed/misplaced bag happened most likely because we were connecting in Singapore an hour before this flight from our previous flight from Houston.","positive"

No words could describe till you experience the great way to fly. Keep it up Singapore Airlines ✈","positive"
"38","Amazing Experience One of the absolute best flights I have ever taken. We were rerouted onto Singapore Airlines business due to weather conditions at our original transfer airport. The staff were fantastic and super attentive. The food was phenomenal. One small gripe, the seat has a very small area for your feet and unless your a side sleeper, is difficult to use. But otherwise it is a great seat and a great airline and I fully understand why they are the best airline of 2023 according to Skytrax.","positive"
"2276","Food remains bad and labs smell terrible There was a strong stench coming from the lavatory the moment I boarded the aircraft. The food did taste good. Vegetables were overcooked until they are yellowish and meats are too salty! Bread was cold. How did Cathay Pacific manage to serve such warm buns that are slightly crispy outside and moist inside? Can SIA offer the same?","neutral"

"5617","Simply put, “Not the best”. I flew them from Singapore to Tokyo. First off, found the legroom to be very limited compared to some of my favourite airlines. The people in front of me, decided to recline and everything went downhill from there. I was absolutely amazed that the Japanese flight attendant told me “This plane is for everybody”, though she said nothing to the Japanese passengers who reclined, in front of me. The journey to Tokyo was very unpleasant because of this. The same flight attendant, then came back and then apologised. However, she said nothing to the passengers in front of me. I will never fly Singapore again, done. I can honestly say, their standards are dropping fast. You will not be getting my custom, ever, ever again. The more you research this topic, you’ll see people are having similar experiences.","negative"
"7652","Amazing airline It wasn’t the first time I travelled with this airline and it has never disappointed me. They are amazing in everything. Confort, service, attentive, nice meals (even in a less than 3h flight). Worth to pay more expensive price to travel with them!!","positive"
"10837","Brisbane to London via Singapore. The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant. The crew kept the cabin spotless, regularly removing rubbish and cleaning the toilets. They also kept a close eye on the cabin at night, regularly offering drinks and snacks to those awake without having to be asked. The gracious crew go the extra mile to make a long journey special. Having flown this journey with most carriers, I will be a loyal Singapore Airlines customer.","positive"
"11086","Manila to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Both legs of my flight were lovely. The staff were incredibly friendly, the flight only took off 10 mins late due to the late arrival of the plane but made up for time in the air and we arrived on time. Quick service, quite comfortable for economy, the food was great for flight food and would definitely recommend.","positive"

First of the person I requested for food in the flight was rude and then got an awful food. The food from singapore to kolkata was good though. It was a similar experience for another traveller who travelled from australia that morn and met on the flight to kolkata from singapore.","negative"
"4974","London to Singapore - Premium Economy Having flown on air New Zealand to London I was expecting a similar standard on the A380 operated by Singapore Airlines. However, while the lounge at Heathrow was good (fortunately I had gold status so managed to use that, no luck if you don't though) the aircraft was a bit tired. It didn't have any power at the seats, so no way of charging a laptop, just a USB outlet. We had the seats behind the bulkhead (71GBP each) but there was not a lot of legroom. Seats were pretty solid - not exactly comfortable. While the staff and the meals were good, it seems that PE is just a bit of an upgrade from Economy, rather than a downgrade from Business as seemed to be the case on Air New Zealand.","positive"
"239","A step backwards I am writing this review because we travelled on from Singapore on an aircraft which had the older Singapore Airlines's business class seats and what a difference they are from the new ones. Wide, comfortable, plenty of places to store items, a solid table and a wide area in which the stretch legs. The new seats are a step backwards as the seat was hard and uncomfortable, the table a folding affair, apart from a pocket near the legs which can't be accessed when the seat is in the lying position, there is nowhere to put items and the area to position legs is so narrow that it is only possible to lie on one side or on the back. The cabin crew, as always, were the very best but why change the seat design from one which was one of the best?","neutral"
"271","Singapore air on the decline I have used this carrier on several trips and three of the last four the flights the inflight entertainment was broken and food only average. I was offered a voucher for the entertainment stuff up, but on a seven hour flight with children, noise cancelling would have been a god send. The flight was also late with embarkment some what. Shambles They had the hide to offer us economy seats to move to watch movies when half of business was empty. After so many time of poor service I will choose another carrier from now on. I don’t know how they continue to rate so high with expectation. Tip. Don’t bother asking for upgrade it won’t happen.","negative"
"9144","To the other side of the world. Polite courteous and on time. Food plentiful you for des and also could ask for snacks whenever.

"2197","Smiley crew I’ve booked the tickets 2 months in advance and the price was almost halved compared to last minute (3 weeks before flight date) booking. Paid extra for seats selection: As the flight was only 2h and I was seated at the last few rows, I was served the meal among the last. There wasn’t much time before landing hence the crew tried to serve quickly and spilled some juice on my “table” without noticing. But it’s commendable that she had not forgotten to smile despite working under pressure and also a few passengers were asking for additional drinks and sauce while she was in a hurry to serve my row. Perhaps SQ could arrange to serve the meals from each section instead of what seemed like one cart serving from the first to last row. Anyway the inflight entertainment and meal were good.","positive"
"4700","Best Airline experience personally Excellent airlines: comfortable seats, good leg space, good entertainment and aids, good choice of meals and drinks, friendly,attentive staff, overall enjoyed the whole flight journey, the best of International airlines to Asia, personally for someone travelling regularly home in different airlines, although more expensive","positive"
"3754","Comfy Economy Class This was my first trip to Indonesia and the first flight that was longer than 5-6 hours so finding an airline that was within my budget and that appeared comfortable was a priority. The economy class section exceeded my expectations because I did not think it was going to be comfortable (blankets, pillows, and reclining seat) and have current in-flight entertainment. I was thankful for the drink options which included alcoholic beverages at no extra cost and sealed water cups. The coffee was strong and helped me get through the last hours of the flight. The food was average plane food with an attempt to provide a variety of meal and snack options. Every meal came with a newly, packaged set of silverware, which I appreciated. They do provide a menu so it helps to plan out your meals. I enjoyed the desserts and snacks most so I recommend packing more snacks and sandwiches if plane food is not your favorite. The flight staff was phenomenal and attentive to our needs. They had the same positive energy from departure to arrival-not sure how they do it! I enjoyed the hot towel service and the amenities (lotion, oral kits, mouth wash) in the restroom. Overall, it was a great flight and hope to ride on Singapore Airlines First Class one day!","positive"

Everything flowed along nicely - this was in the middle of a lot of COVID19 issues - and the staff were very professional and courteous. The flight went off without a hitch, the food was better than I'd expected (it had been some years since my last long haul flight) and I'd happily fly with these guys again.","positive"

"7454","Not as expected and as advertised This flight is considered the longest flight, although, returning from New Jersey to Singapore is one hour longer due to head wind. I wanted to give a try.. and expect that the service of SQ should be improved vs the one that I took last year (Dec 2017), flying from Sin to JFK via Frankfurt taking A380 -same class. Flight took off just midnight, local time. I was expecting that taking this long haul flight, we are given option on either have some meal or all day dining style (means we could just request the meal - and would be prepared in about 30 mins time). Reason : being at the business class, where one paid more, and need to have a rest (midnight !!!), why airlines are having this ""ODD"" regulations on "" asking / forcing "" their business class passenger to eat???? I am very annoyed, crossed and disappointed with this kind of service.. by one of the renown airlines in the world. I am comparing this service with same class, Middle East origin airlines -Qatar and Emirates... very different. Also comparing with EVA air - also very different. I also notice that SQ flight attendants are not ready/ prepared for long distance flight (fatique??).. because level of service is REALLY fall short to the normal. For short and medium haul flight, SQ service is REALLY GOOD. This means flight up to 7 hours. Anything more than this (duration), level of service, as well as system arranged by airlines is BAD. One thing that improved vs last year.. at least there is a proper coffee served in business class (vs last year - only dirty water with coffee aroma )","neutral"

"6130","Regressing I used to love flying on Singapore Airlines. The service, amenities, food were all superb when compared to other airlines. Not sure whether it is cost pressures but the situation is no longer as rosy as before. Advanced seat reservation now comes at a price; the headphones that used to be provided are now replaced with disposable earphones; the usual Straits Times copy that you could expect to read now have very few copies for distribution. The food used to always come with a menu that you can peruse as your flight took off. Now the menu is gone and the quality of the food has also deteriorated. The flight I took looked like it had a first class, business class, premium economy class and economy class. We had to board all the way from the front and go through the various aisles before we got to our section making for a slow and tedious boarding process. I think they're still better than other airlines but compared to before, SQ has regressed significantly.","neutral"

"1088","Great Singapore airlines service? For years i have heard about the legendary service provided by singapore airlines. I have had several friends and family members use them over the years and everyone ravved about the service. I have to assume none of them ever had to deal with SA customer service. I woke up this morning to a message from SA that they rebooked me for a later flight. This later flight leaves SFO 12 hour later and increases my layover in singapore from 3 to 15 hours. This delays my arrival in the Maldives by 30 hours!!!! I understand avaition is fluid and there are many reasons they may have occurred. The upsetting part is that there are other options they could have booked me on. There is a flight that leaves SFO 4 hours later and a flight departing singapore that would give me a 5 hiur layover. Their website will not allow me to make any osrt of change despite what appears to be availability on both flighy options i would prefer. More importantly flight options that would put me in my desired destination 15 hours late rather than 30. With this i decided to call SA customer service. I have now been on hold for 4 hours. That is right 4 hours!!! Absolutely ridiculous in any case, let alone a company known for ""great service"". Especially painful when even my local cable company that practically embraces pior service provide their customers the option to opt out of the wait and receive a call back when operatora are available. This great company with a dedication to service doesn't have that option in 2022!!! C'mon Whike waiting i went to the SA website to fill out a flight change request form specifically for those needing to make a change for same day travel. After submitting the form I received an auto reply that says they will get back to me within 15 days!! And the laughs keep coming. That same auto reply says, for faster service please call customer service. So before stepping foot on their flight, i have already decided SA has zero commitment for service. It is great they have such high standards for the flight, but that means absolutely nothing if they cannot provide any service whatsoever prior to the flight. I will never waste my money on singapore airlines again. They can go to hell","negative"

It is not our fault the membership status was not printed on the tickets by the Singapore system. Then upon producing the electronic form on my phone was not good enough, nor an out dated card, and not my wife's current ancillary gold elite card but finally found my current card. We were then able to proceed through. Felt as if we were freeloaders being caught in a honey trap!

I have traveled on most airlines worldwide in first class. I purchased a full fare first class ticket. It was a waste of money! The aircraft was very clean and the seat was comfortable. The amenties were cheap and I did not use them. They presented a menu but most items were not unavailable. I have never used the service call button while traveling in First for over 24 years. I used it three times on this flight which was 8 hours long. I chose the ""order the cook"" meal and the food was awful! There were two passengers that were drunk and extremely loud (I'm surprised they were allowed to board). The flight crew kept serving them vodka even though many of us asked if there could be something done to help with the extreme noise they were making.

Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by drinks and dinner. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. Dinner choices on the PER-SIN leg were limited to Pork Stew and Stir fried beef but they were not too bad. Breakfast was served on the SIN-BOM leg with a choice of Indian crepes or baked eggs with chicken sausage and baked beans. The aircraft's are showing signs of ageing though as some PTVs were not working and a couple of seats in the middle row seem to have had reclining problems.

It was hundreds less than British and American Airlines. The flight was 3/4 full so was able to sit alone. Seats are comfortable and planes are clean. Food is ok if you enjoy Asian cuisine. This flight goes to Singapore so if you don’t like Asian cuisine, then bring your own food. The staff is not as friendly as other cross Atlantic airlines. I could be wrong but it is as if they don’t appreciate UK travelers. Manchester airport is over crowded during holiday season so give yourself enough time between your flights. If your UK flight is with FlyBe be forewarned if you have carryon luggage. They changed their policy so it is comical how they charge extra for those bags that typically can be carryons on other airlines. If prices increase, then I will not fly Singapore to UK!","neutral"

"766","Abysmal customer service before we even got to fly We have been so let down by customer service at Singapore Air after buying business class tickets from the US to Vietnam that were fully changeable and refundable, so it was a pretty penny spent. Our flight originally was in February and due to COVID restrictions we had to change it to October, this part was ok. In July we discovered we could not travel in October and called 3 times to change the flight. The first 2 times after much discussion we were told they would have to have someone calculate the fare difference and call us back within 48 hrs (based on online pricing, the fare difference was only about $50/ticket). We never received a call back. Either time. Upon calling a third time in early August, all of the sudden they could calculate the fare difference and guess what, it was then $2500/ticket as tickets had increased in price since we first attempted to make the change. We found flights on Cathay Pacific and called to get a refund of our 10k in early August. There was some confusion as our credit card number had been stolen and thus changed in the interim, but we instructed them to still refund the money to the original number and our bank would manage it. 8 weeks later, no refund yet. Called a 5th time and we’re told they had not processed the refund despite our request because of the change in cc number. They are reportedly processing it now, but it “may” take another 6 weeks. They have had our money for almost a year now, 10 weeks since we requested it back, and I am so very disappointed in what I thought would be a great airline to fly. Everyone is struggling post pandemic, but it should not have been that difficult and sours us from ever attempting to fly them in the future for sure. Beware, their change/refund policies are not as easy as they make it sound.","negative"

The females with one exception were unsmiling and almost snatched trays from us. During meal service flight attendants in the past always ensured the comfort of passenger dining by requesting the seats be upright but on these two flights I had to ask that this be done. Also there was a huge rush to get a stone cold awful breakfast served before landing in Brisbane - why? Then they missed the fact that a passenger in front still had his seat reclined for landing.

Saw the Chief Stewardess (red kebaya) offering other passengers whether they wanted to change seats as there were unoccupied seats with empty seats next to them. Food relative to other airlines, was good. Staff would bother to describe what food options you have even though they've given you the menu earlier. Compared to United or Delta who will ask you ""chicken or beef"" without any menu cards. Like they choose the food to eat themselves with no regard to what it's cooked with. Staff when backing down the aisle will always announced themselves to prevent bumping into the legs of passengers. Something unseen in most other airlines, especially American ones who basically can't be bothered. Staff would also help you put your luggage on the overhead compartments. Again, something American airlines would refuse to do, citing union regulations??!!","positive"
"175","Reliable airline with a modern fleet, some consistency issues. A decent airline with some room for improvement. I've had the opportunity to fly with Singapore Airlines a few times this year and each time I come away with different feelings. The consistency in service that you find on other airlines doesn't seem to exist with Singapore Airlines. Sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much. On this particular flight from Singapore to Dubai, boarding was late by about 40 minutes - not a huge deal but the lack of communication was frustrating. Boarding was relatively quick and the Airbus A350-900 is a fantastic aircraft to fly on. The seat was comfortable (economy) and there were nice amenities for use during the flight, such as a pillow, blanket and headphones. I opted to use my own noise cancelling head-phones connected to the In-Flight entertainment via a cable. As the aircraft pushed back, a flight attendant quite rudely told me ""noise cancelling headphones aren't allowed!"" Before I had the chance to ask why, she had already disappeared. When she passed again, I asked her about her prior instruction and she told me that I could not wear them during the safety video. At this time she realized that they were in-fact connected to the IFE and said that I could keep them on. The first meal-service didn't start until almost 3 hours into the flight! For those, like myself, who had connected through Singapore from a previous long-haul flight, it was frustrating having to wait this long as I wanted to maximize rest for the arrival into Dubai. The second meal-service was a slice of over-cooked pizza in a soggy cardboard box. Disappointing to say the least. All-in-all, Singapore is generally a reliable carrier with modern aircraft and nice cabins. Perhaps with some work on consistency would go along way. I'm booked to fly with them again in 2024 so it'll be interesting to see if there is some improvement here.","positive"

"7474","The joys of business class We recently had the privilege of being able to travel in business class from Bne to Singapore on our way to HK. WOW. We thought Singapores service in premium economy was wonderful. In BC I’m sure royalty wouldn’t be treated better. From the food, the drinks to the full recline beds the cabin crew were there too look after everything including guiding me to the loo in the middle of the night. It was tucked away a bit. 😉. Definitely will make an effort to spoil ourselves again soon.","positive"
"7044","Wow! What an amazing experience! First 18 hour flight and I was nervous but SingaporeAir knocked it out of the park. Business Class is like your own little twin bed cubby. The chairs transforms into a bed and goes completely flat. Everything can be plugged in and charged. Unlimited videos and music. Food was fantastic, especially the ice cream!","positive"
"1130","Very disappointing I have not flown with SIA for a few years now as they've been over priced and disappointing service and old aircraft's flying out of Brisbane, in this instance I had no choice as I had to get to Manchester asap, at Brisbane there was one Cafe open in the whole airport, no lounges because of lack of flights due to covid, we were given a $20 voucher! So the flight from Brisbane to Singapore has an updated aircraft which has a better seat configuration 1-2-1, no welcome drink, (no hot towels menus mags or duty free because of covid) food and service was OK on that flight and we had lounge access before boarding flight from Singapore to Manchester, no welcome drink, they still have those badly designed big seats on SQ51 (12 hour flight) food OK and was told 2 hours before landing they may not be able to serve breakfast but they did and so they should, so all in all pretty ordinary. But then return flights from Manchester to Brisbane were not good, check in was chaos due to all Dpd covid forms, no priorty lane for security, so SQ52 to singapore no lounge access at singapore lounge if you were travelling from Europe even though triple vaccd and neg pcr test, again no welcome drink, no drink after take off either this time, I ordered lamb loin, the meals came out economy style all on a tray, I had to send mine back as I couldn't cut it it was so tough, I complained and was told I would have to wait 20 minutes for another meal, chicken curry and rice which came out cold, at that stage I couldn't be bothered sending back, I could hear other passengers complaining, crew disappeared and if you wanted anything you had to call for service, I felt like a leper, breakfast was pleasant and hot, upon arrival to Singapore we were to go to a holding pen but our flight was late so we were escorted to the gate, sq236 to Brisbane breakfast was served, good job I ate it as no other meal was served on this 7.5 hour flight, crew disappeared quickly after breakfast and no drink service of any kind unless you asked for it and then you got a a bag of nuts or crisps, I think standards have really slipped and covid is being used as an excuse for some of it, I wouldn't fly with SIA unless I had to, I usually fly with Etihad who provide a much better service but unfortunately not currently flying direct from Brisbane","negative"
"10769","Singapore to Los Angeles via Incheon. The aircraft was clean and the seats were noticeably narrower than the PE seat on the Singapore A380. Again I was disappointed by the minimal service by the cabin crew. I had looked forward to my flights on Singapore Airlines and found them to be lacking in attention to their passengers. I would fly Singapore again, but I would not go out of my way to do so as I did this time. I doubt that I would spend the extra money to move up to Premium Economy.","neutral"

Despite requesting special assistance well in advance, confirming it through emails and at check-in, no assistance was provided at Changi Airport during the transit period.

"7223","Wonderful - Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner Took the option to fly Business Class from Bali to Singapore on my way back from Indonesia. The Business Class was the best I have flown thus far in terms of space, comfort and service since they have commenced to use the new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. Singapore Airlines uses the Premier Lounge Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali for the Business Class passengers. While the overall variety of the food in the lounge is not much, the quality of the food is excellent. As for the flight itself, the service of the crew was excellent on board. The only point of improvement if any is the inflight menu. I selected the option of the snapper and it was regualr airline food that you would expect on a flight. Other than that, it was a fabulous experience.","positive"

We had the privilege of travelling overseas in business class and what a beautiful experience it was. I pre booked our meals with ‘book the cook’, their choices of meals is overwhelming so be prepared to take some time to choose what you would like. The check in process is flawless and so easy. Kris lounge is exceptional and it was particularly nice to shower between flights so you can get onto the next flight feeling fresh. The flight attendants’ attention to detail is second to none, addressing you by your name and ensuring that you’ve had enough to eat and drink and then you just recline in your lay flat bed to get a few hours sleep. What a way to fly, I never want to sit in economy ever again.","positive"
"5669","Singapore Airlines SIA I have flown on Singapore Airlines for over 20 years over 40 plus flights. It is the best service, and most comfortable flight you can have.

I can see why it is legendary. I have never had a bad flight on Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"6007","A comfortable way to fly to Singapore We flew to Singapore by an Airbus A380 for a cruise on the 'Voyager of the Seas'. Since the flight was not permitted to fly over Pakistan Airspace, the outbound flight took 13 hours and the inbound one 14 and a half hours. Check-in at Heathrow and boarding were trouble-free. Since our party consisted of three adults, we were allocated three seats together towards the centre of the aircraft. We had ample room, and the seats were quite comfortable. My wife and I had asked for 'seafood meals', and these were served first. Unfortunately we had finished our meals before the wine was brought round. The food was adequate, but by no means outstanding, with both the starter and the main course consisting of pasta with seafood. My son had a normal meal which had an ice cream sweet. I asked if my wife and I could have an ice cream too but was told by a member of the cabin staff that the seafood meal did not include an icecream. A few minutes later I asked another member of the cabin staff if we could have an ice cream, and she promptly brought us two. However, on the whole, we found the cabin staff extremely friendly and helpful. We found the entertainment system excellent and easy to use with a good selection of recent movies. When I went to the toilet, I noticed that the waste paper container was completely full, and my wife said that her toilet had run out of toilet paper, so standards have slipped. In our opinion, for a long flight, the A380 is preferable to other smaller aircraft.","positive"

"9761","Still the best A very comfortable flight, excellent service and the food would rival some food I have had in business class on other airlines. Defintiley the best service and food in econmy on any airline.....and I have flown a few. Travelling as a couple, one preferring a window seat and the other needing an aisle seat after back surgery, one of us usually ends up in the middle seat. With the option to preselect our seats, I opted for a window and aisle. At Melbourne checkin it was suggested we change seats to a window and an aisleleaving thr middle seat in between free. Whilst the airline could not block nor guarantee that the middle seat would remain empty, we took the chance and it paid off. We were lucky that from Singapore to Rome, then Rome all the way back to Melbourne we had the middle seat to ourselves. Thankyou for the heads up Singapore Airline Melbourne checkin. Our selected flights also had only a 1.5 hour stopover in Singapore both ways, which made for a more streamlined journey. Would recommend Singapore airlines and will definitely be my airline of choice where possible.","positive"

"10833","Bangkok to Singapore. This sector was the second sector of my flight back from Vienna, the VIE-BKK sector being on Austrian Airlines. As a short 2-hour regional flight, SQ still lives up to its reputation of being a premium airline. Shortly after take-off, dinner service commenced with a choice of 2 main courses. Being a short flight, menu cards were not distributed to passengers. Instead, flight attendants showed passengers a menu card with photos of the main courses and descriptions of the meal. I had the chicken casserole with penne pasta. Drinks and coffee or tea were served at the same time. As it was a short flight, I did not watch any movies on the IFE. One difference that I noticed was that earphones distributed were of the in-ear type instead of the over-ear type typically used by SQ. Perhaps in a move to save costs, headphones in economy are no longer of the over-ear type? I can’t confirm this as it has been some years since I have flown SQ economy.","positive"

The SilverKris Lounge serves a good variety of hot food, alcohol incl Charles Heidsieck Champagne and TWG teas (12 selections). Inflight meal wasn't that impressive. I ordered Book the Cook, Seared Nut-Crusted Veal Fillet - the meat was quite dry and bland. The smoked duck appetizer was fine, and the dessert of passion fruit sponge-mousse was just ok. I expected a wider seat, but not the case for Dreamliner with 2018RJ seat type, compared to older versions like 2006 A380 or 2009 B777.","positive"

Regardless of seating I believe SA always offers premium service - economy is very comfortable and the service great. Let me say, their Business Class is a whole different level. The food was outstanding, but it is the service that is really the stand out. From the crew setting my bed up, fluffing my pillow, then when its time to eat a cloth is laid on my table and properly set with glass wear and cutlery.........really..........the quality of food was sensational too - nothing missing here.........so nice. Looking forward to my return flight :)","positive"
"6109","Distant, aloof, pushy and disinterested We used Singapore Airways for our recent trip to Australia and back and boy I wish we hadn't. I chose Singapore because of the consistent reviews and the fact it had the right non-stop flights for us. Sadly not one of our flights, we had 5 in total, came anywhere close to the reviews I've read on every level. Cabin staff were on the verge of rude and quiet often pushy and disinterested. I normally strike up a quick raport with the cabin crew as I find it useful on a long haul flight especially if you want to walk around and stretch a smile and a hello normally goes a long way but I must've stepped in something from the looks I received in return. As always when meals are served it's curtesy to put your seat upright, no problem, except I obviously didn't do it fast enough for their likely I was told, not asked, to ""put your seat up"" and then I had them attempt to force it upright, bearing in mind today's touchy attitude I'm not going to argue or cause a fuss, I got the distinct impression difficult passenger protocol was an easy option for them. The food itself was way below par across all our flights with overcooked chicken, soggy and gluggy pasta, undercooked potatoes and was generally poor throughout. As for the legroom and inflight entertainment smaller and tighter in all areas than others I've used for the same trip. Sorry Singapore I don't rate you at all, I'll be going back to Emirates, Etihad, Air Transact, BA (surprisingly) or anyone else for my next trip.","negative"

"5976","They lost my bag for an 8 week trip, terrible customer service and no compensation I choose to fly with singapore airlines as their on board service is fantastic, but I felt like I was the first person ever to loose her suitcase, I had a stop over in singapore, I arrived my suitcase never did, to cut the very long story short it was awful customer service with no one taking responsibility to help me, false promises my suitcase was on the way waiting for its arrival and it never arrived, no financial support, no help what so ever, 14 different numbers I was told to phone and in the end I had to email reservations to get somone to help me and my complaints were falling on deaf ears. When I was leaving singapore to perth they couldn't even guarantee my seat as they over booked the flight and gave up my reserved seat even though it was on medical grounds. Into my forth week I finally got honest communication that my bag was no where to be found and the lies ended. However now my trip had ended they have a maximum amount that can be claimed so I am well out of pocket for something that wasn't my fault and only offered airmiles or a voucher that in no way at all makes up for the stress and financial loss they have caused me. So how they got the best airline beats me, it has to solely rely on the onboard staff. They have had my claim for around 5 weeks now and I am still waiting for the less the half to be paid out. Its completely appalling. I will never fly with singapore airlines again. They had many opportunities for good customer service and failed me big time. Maybe they treat all economy customers like this? They seem to concentrate on business and first class customers, so if you are one of those you will be ok!! As you can tell, I am very angry which everyone i talk to understands, but singapore airlines does not.","negative"

This is a design fault and needs to be corrected. This is not good for anybody who has any back issues. Loading -no flight call in lounge at Singapore that's okay but when arrival at gate on appointed time about 20 business passengers were left waiting whilst premium economy was loaded first and seats from 47 upwards economy were also loaded. All before business class. Smooth and early loading is one of the reasons I chose business class. Suggest Etihad airlines Thai airlines or even flatbed AirAsia.","negative"

On this recent trip we flew five legs with the airline and in all cases their service was exemplary. The cabins are always well maintained, especially the toilets where staff regularly ensure that they are clean and well stocked. We had an issue at one airport where we needed to ensure that our luggage was leaving on the same flight as ourselves; Singapore Airline staff were quickly onto the task of confirming this and once they received confirmation they sought me out even though I had committed to calling into the Departure counter to check. The other great advantage of flying with Singapore Airlines is that we land in Singapore and make use of a stopover for a few days to get ourselves back into the time zone after travelling to Europe. Going through Changi Airport is always a pleasure rather than a chore. Highly recommended.","positive"

We now don't travel long distance unless we can afford Business class. We have reduced our number of trips and save like mad to pay the premium.

"10377","MAN-SIN-SYD-SIN-MAN earlier this month was my first long-haul flights since before the pandemic. I’ve always loved Singapore Airlines, and I still do. Generally, a very friendly service, although I felt that the cabin crew on the MAN-SIN leg were a bit less so. I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn’t. While not quite the uber luxurious SQ of days gone by, I still think they are a great airline. Just fix up the catering, especially.","positive"

"2174","Boeing 777-300ER Old Aircraft! In our recent trip to Tokyo, we were flying with Singapore Airlines again and it was an old Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft (I will discuss that shortly). While check-in was smooth in Changi Airport, the flight was delayed due to the ""late arrival of the aircraft"". It was delayed by 30mins. But somehow we managed to touch down in Haneda Airport just with a mere 5 mins delay, and the pilots did a great job. Both taking off and landing were perfect and so smooth and you won't actually feel anything. Kudos to the team! Next, the aircraft was old though it was supposed to be a retrofitted version. Seat was generally ok as we sat in the ""forward section"". The in-flight system was old, slow and kept hanging from time to time. Remote was also insensitive and the flight path display was ""2D"" and look dated. The contents were somehow quite limited too. As for the food, it was average but not hot when served. The crew were friendly, attentive and did a great job, walking around constantly to serve drinks and clear the used cups etc. Overall, the flight was satisfactory though can be better. Return flight: On our return flight to Singapore, it was an airbus A330-300, it was a better and newer aircraft as compared to the boeing 777. Seat and legroom were fine and inflight was better than the boeing 777 though can be better. The flight left on time from Haneda. And again the pilots did a marvelous job, smooth took off and landing and in fact arrived at Changi about 20mins ahead of schedule! As for the food, there was no choice as the more popular item ""Japanese set"" were all given out and many had to accept the other only option. I noticed some passengers didn't take but requested for instant noodles (either they didn't eat spicy food or pork). Food was average but the ice cream was yummy! Cabin crew was overall friendly and attentive and polite (especially the Japanese crew who kept apologizing and thanking to accept the only other set meal). But the leading stewardess was not too friendly and when we asked about the collection of our purchased item (we did the order online) when announcement that Krisshop was available, she seemed impatient somehow and responded ""wait for my colleagues to finish their work first"" and walked off. Perhaps she had a bad day or being frustrated with some other passengers? Hmm, is that the ""right"" or ""political correct"" answer? She could be more tactful and told us that her colleagues would follow up in a while after they had finished with whatever they were doing. But the crew who later brought us the item was friendly and smileful though. In both of these flights, there were ""hits and misses"" in the inflight system, seat, food and cabin crew service. But as for the pilots, they were doing a great job for these 2 flights and credit and compliments must be given to them!

Checked in the PHN, it the most painful experience, and I have been abandoned without any help. Even have to rebooked, called take more 2 hrs, extrage charge for new booking, everything has been the most difficult thing to deal with, and very unfair for passengers!! NOT CUSTOMER AT ALL! Think carefully before you booked SIN airline. IT will ruin the whole connecting flight. I missed the connected flights!","negative"
"7023","Draught and cold Our flight out to Houston was great. The service and the food quality was very good but the return flight was nowhere near as pleasant. We were sat at the rear of the first economy section near the toilets and despite our requests the staff were unable to do anything about a cold draught. In fact the whole section was a bit cold with most people wrapped in their blankets","neutral"
"7446","Usual Singapore Airlines top-consistency! As long-haul travel veterans of over 40 years, we've seen many airlines come and go, rise and fall. Singapore Airlines is one of the very rare international service providers that have always delivered consistent excellence of service year after year, decade after decade. It is truly admirable. The staff at Singapore Airlines are always attentive to your every need, and always make you feel welcome....even in the dead hours of the night many hours into those long sectors. We have flown both Business and Economy over the years, and we have found them to be consistent regardless of class.","positive"

"2859","First time with Singapore Airlines. We have just returned from a trip to Singapore and Vietnam which we booked to fly with Singapore Airlines. We had heard good reports of the service provided and we weren't disappointed. Our return journey was via Paris Charles de Gaulle where we were met off the inbound flight at Terminal 1 by an airline representative who escorted us to Terminal 2E for our ongoing flight. We had not expected this but having completed the rather torturus transfer we were pleased that this had been arranged. We would certainly look to use Singapore Airlines in the future.","positive"

"1220","DO NOT TRANSIT VIA SINGAPORE OR USE SINGAPORE AIRLINES I booked a flight from Jakarta to Darwin, I knew I had a long transit in Singapore (over 10hours) I looked online after booking and saw that I could access the lounge and pay a fee to get more comfort in the terminal 3. Well... we never made it to Terminal 3. Singapore Airlines 'forgot' to mention that no passengers have access to the terminal while transiting but only a WAITING ROOM, I would have look at another option if I knew in advance, it wasn't mentioned anywhere (time of booking or confirmation) I am pregnant and I felt very uncomfortable during my transit, also it was very DIRTY in the waiting room, during the 10 hours I never saw any staff cleaning around, go figure during a pandemic .... I felt UNSAFE, not looked after, this experience put me off SINGAPORE AIRLINES and I already told few friends that are about to travel to avoid at all cost this company.. What a joke !","negative"
"4783","Spent a lot of time in the back of the plane with flight attendents as it was a long flight. They were great... No matter what airline you fly to the far east, try to transit Chiang Airport in Singapore and allow yourself a long layover to explore Marina Bay and The Jewel at the airport itself. There are free tours from the airport but if they are full, hop on the train to Marina Bay. Easy access and travel.","positive"

Had a small meal, which was nice touch for a Regional Flight. Landed early in HAN, and I wished a Trainee Cabin Attendant best of luck on Qualifying.

The service was very very attentive, both Krug (2004 special version) and Dom (2006) were served. The bed was great, and they had a turn down service after dinner. A upside about SQ first class was that they provide 100MB free WIFI onboard, and you can use them when you were in north pole. Another great thing about this flight was the LAX star alliance first lounge, they had great service, and the shrimp cocktail tasted good. But the downside is that the plane was parked in the outer port, so shuttle connection was needed, and I hated that since it was packed with people and luggage.","positive"
"4336","Caring service Just arrived from Cape Town this morning. My Daughter had an upset tummy prior to the flight so we were careful with her food. The crew looked after her well and checked in frequently to see that she was ok. They made her clear noodles and bread, and some dry cereals and croissants at breakfast. Luckily she had a nice flight and her tummy was fine. We would just like to say thank you to the crew for their attentive service.","positive"
"9735","cutting cost - ground crew below average I might be wrong but after observing the attitude of the cabin crew over couple of flights, I feel that the cabin crew feels too good to be humble to passengers from certain country and possibly speak the language even if most of them are the native speaker in that language. , ground crew at Singapore airline is equal to the low fare airline. The food is very good but one can tell that Singapore airline is cutting cost. Less flight attendants on flights, water ? well this is the first airline I see that does not have bottled water but serves you water out of the water tank on the plane. The quality of the water or at least the taste of it is not very good. Are you a gold member from star alliance ? you will get treated equally with other airlines with the exception of Singapore airline, clear differentiation between treating their own members first, including boarding, lounge etc. Unfortunately I have two fly with Singapore couple of more times and then I will try to avoid purchasing tickets from Singapore Airline.","neutral"
"9905","Well done. Economy travel is rarely noteworthy, however when our connecting flight was delayed due to bad weather, it caused us to miss the next connection out of Singapore. Upon arrival the airline had already booked us on the next available flight and arranged for our overnight accommodation and meals at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at Changi airport. The efficiency and service from the airline for a delay which they technically had no control over, is to be applauded.","positive"

"5152","Seat location is important Singapore Airlines provide a really nice service but you will need to check where you are sitting before the flight. If you need to go to the toilet a lot, then an aisle seat is easier. Try not to sit right at the back as the seats don't seem to lay back enough and the attendants were out of some food items by the time we were served. Our flight to Singapore was great on a newer plane but the trip home was on an older plane that was not as spacious. We also found the overhead luggage compartments were full where we were sitting for the trip home and needed to place our carry on luggage down the aisle further which made getting off an issue to stop mid way down the aisle. For the trip over, we boarded in order of seating which was great but on the way back, they boarded everybody. (Could have been where the lack of storage came from). I expect that most of the passengers on the way back to Adelaide may have had more things such as gifts and souvenirs). Overall, the flight was OK.","positive"

"6612","Non-stop flight to SFO This was a vacation for me and my wife and I choose this particular flight because of the departure and arrival timing. I set a countdown on my phone once the flight took off to ensure we knew when we needed to shutoff the inflight entertainment. This works really well and we felt rested and ready to explore SFO once we landed. The seats were pretty comfortable and the cabin service was great as expected from SQ. However, the seat adjustment was a problem for my wife as it was pretty stiff and this is probably because it was a new plane. The food selection was great but taste-wise, we felt it was underwhelming. On our return flight, we decided to try out the ""Book the Cook"" menu instead and we felt the meals tasted a lot better.","positive"

The selection of port and dessert wines (if you like sweet) is good. First class lounge in Sydney is more private than the business class lounge, but much smaller. Felt that the options for food and drinks were somewhat limited. Shower facilities are good. This was the best flight I have experienced.","positive"

"3777","The only way to fly to NY to Frankfurt Flying Singapore between New York and Frankfurt offers first-class service at a competitive price. The A380 is impressively quiet and stable, even in turbulence. Singapore’s flight attendants are true professionals - impeccably dressed and always cheerful, courteous, and attentive. (Seriously. The plane could be doing a barrel role and they would still be offering hot towels with a smile.) Premium Economy is worth the small price increase, with larger seats and substantially more legroom. On my return flight to New York, the “brunch” menu was a little rich for 10 AM (pork belly and noodles was the most “neutral” item on offer), but the food is consistently above par. As a nervous flyer and a light sleeper on planes, I also appreciate the unlimited adult beverage service. I highly recommend this flight for those looking for direct service between New York and Germany.","positive"
"7283","Excellent fight with Boeing 787-10 Singapore Airlines always perform excellent fight & service. For my latest trip, I flied with Boeing 787-10. It’s a pretty new model of their aircrafts. The Economy Class is very comfortable with the seats as 3-3-3 for each row. So it has more leg room (in front & under the seat) and also comfy bigger seat space. You can find everything on your front, e.g. Big touch screen nearly 12” which gives very bright & clear image, easy to control & select your favorite programs, USB Outlet, Headphone outlet, Coat hanging, Lighting control, Flight attendant calling, Food tray, etc. It’s very convenience. I love it! The flight attendants are very nice & polite with quick service. The food quality is good. And one more thing that I am very impressed is the new version of “In-Flight Safety VDO”. It’s very interesting and shows a lot of main attractions in Singapore which sync together with the safety instruction perfectly.","positive"

The Jet Airways flight was half an hour late and it was obviously decided before we landed that we would not be allowed to board the ongoing leg, as we were collected and ushered to get new boarding passes for a much later flight. We were then offered a flight only 3.5 hours later with Singapore Airlines and the staff at Singapore Airport completed all the documentation, including the transferring of our bags. But all our bags have gone missing and did not turn up in Sydney. I realise that they are still in ""tracking"" mode, however we are desperate to get them back before Christmas. We have tried all day calling Singapore Airlines, but they do not answer.","negative"

"1384","What a remarkable service and experience with SQ 391 in spite of the COVID-19 crisis Traveling on Singapore airlines is always a pleasant experience for me. But it is especially so during a COVID-19 crisis. First and foremost the cabin and toilets are extremely and impeccably clean . The toilets remain so throughout the long flight. The service was excellent and the stewards are all cheerful and helpful in spite of the risks they are undertaking by working during these treacherous times. If they are worried about the virus, they never show it and were all professional and indulging towards the passengers. My special compliments to Daniel and Pei Shan who take pains to accommodate the endless of my boss. They are always smiling and optimistic, eager to serve. What remarkable service and experience ! If you miss Asian food after staying in Europe for more than 3 weeks, the Asian food is very delightful. What a comfort and relief to fly home to Singapore via Singapore airlines during times like that. Thank God for His grace and mercies.","positive"
"10668","London to Bali via Singapore. I flew to Australia with Singapore Airlines 5 years ago and the service was out of this world, amazing. I flew last October with them to Bali and back and it seems that standards have slipped. It seems there are a lot more male stewards on board now and they seem to give worse service than the female stewardesses. Male stewards seemed disorganised, flustered and abrupt compared to the female stewardesses who were very organised and polite. The airline needs to have standard procedures that staff follow. We had an issue with my partners meal being vegetarian nut free and Singapore Airlines were less than helpful. They served him nuts and or meat in a few of his meals, luckily he didn't eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didn't exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we weren't lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment. We didn't pay to be sat together and yet we still were on each leg of the journey. I'm giving it all a 7 because the journey was just about okay, it wasn't amazing like it was last time I flew with them","positive"

Only 2 suitcases at 50 pounds. So I had to pay for a different flight on a different airline that day and change all my plans. Singapore Airlines then said that flight was non-refundable. I booked with Amex, thank god and got my money back. I was never able to actually speak with Customer Service only email over days.","negative"

I also found that the food was pretty poor quality. The only saving grace is that the hostesses were attentive and when I asked for something, it usually arrived promptly and with a high degree of courtesy. In all, I don’t think that Singapore Airlines are all that they’re cracked up to be, unless you can afford first class or a suit.","neutral"

"7320","Excellent Services It was not our first time flying with Singapore Airlines in Business Class. We always found the services given to my family and I were excellent. They were super friendly, attentive as well as informative. For instance, when our daughter suddenly felt unwell and vomited, they quickly approached us by giving wet towels, paper and plastic bags and also routinely checking on our daughter condition, making sure that she was feeling better. Besides that, my son - who loves about airplane - wanted to tour the cabin was also accommodated by the cabin crew and my son was very excited. Not only that, when we asked to one of the stewards who was part of that team whether we would be able to catch connecting flight to Surabaya - serviced by Silk Air - He assured us not to worry about that as his colleague at Changi Airport would assist the transferring process from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 upon arrival at Changi Airport due to tight connection. Finally, we were able to make it since the Paris flight arrived ahead of time - approximately 1 hour 15 minutes. In conclusion, we were extremely pleased and satisfied with the services provided by the Cabin Crew who were on duty on our flight.","positive"

When I asked for this to be changed at Cairns bag drop, I was advised that it could only be done at Changi. When I arrived at Changi, I found their service desk and requested the change which was completed quickly and with a smile. Very comfortable seats with plenty of leg room as I was in a bulkhead aisle seat. Although seat had a leg rest my feet dangled in mid air due to no footrest and I’m 5’ 2”! Meals were very good for airline food and I was please to see there was lots of regular water/juice provision throughout flight. Entertainment provision was excellent, especially noise cancelling earphones. Lots of good choice from films to tv programmes and music.

"10929","Singapore to Denpasar. In general, Singapore Airlines was good, however, their service seems to be going downhill. Dining experience was slow - the cabin crew on the other section of economy cabin even had finished their service completely while the cabin crew on my section had just finished halfway. Another thing was there was no consistency since the crew started from wrong direction. Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover. Since the crew on my section was so slow; therefore, they expected us to finish our meal so fast so they could clear up. I have traveled with them a lot and I have been in business class. I didn't compare it with business but this was the first time in my flight with them in economy that the service was slow, ran out of choices, no food cover, non-focused cabin crew, etc. I hope they can improve before it goes down to far and losing their loyal customers further","positive"
"1640","Very didsappointing Our first time travelling Premium Economy as it was such a long flight. The seat was at the rear of Prem Econ, one row away from economy and tiny babies and toddlers. there were a lot of people using the same loos. The food was inedible. The inflight entertainment choice was not wonderful. The exercise video was useless and told you to do things you couldn't possibly do on an aircraft, like stick your leg out (both sides!) The next leg of our flight was by Air New Zealand. They were better than Sing Airlines by a long way because: Real glass and china Good food Better welcome and service Prem Econ was part of First class cabin. less people using the loos. There was an exercise video to do in your chair (20 mins or so) We felt special and we felt like we got something for the double air fare. We did not feel this either way with Air Singapore. I would not reccomend them.","negative"
"6737","SFO ground staff really went out of their way Our flight from Las Vegas was delayed by a freak snow storm and we missed our connection to Singapore. The airline was able to rebook us for the following morning, thankfully Marilee the outstanding gate agent was able to get my wife and I seats together, and the entire cabin crew of SQ 31 made for a very pleasant First flight on the A350.","positive"
"5064","best airline in the world. they are not only high tech maintaining latest trends/techniques for airlines, they beat anyone in terms of hospitality, care and positive behavior overall. this is so typical singapoean's nature...warmth with a big smile. that makes them different.","positive"
"1594","Heathrow-Singapore-Sydney And Return The flight from Heathrow to Singapore, excellent other than having to ask for mask socks and toothbrush. Singapore to Syndey, this did not feel the same level of service less attentive staff. On the return journey Syney to Singapore again had to request items which felt a bit tiresome. Singapore to Heathrow felt uncomfortable at times when requesting anything including water, as we approached Europe the staff seemed unwilling to bring up the lights and serve breakfast when everyone was awake and hungry. Eventually breakfast was served and taken away so quickly before we landed people didn't really have the time to eat the breakfast. However in all flights check in staff were very helpful and so smiley. Although it seems by this review I was not happy, I would recommend them anytime.","positive"
"1132","Excellent Service for Parents with Young Infants We we’re first time new parents to our young 11 month old baby and it was our first time flying with our child. The service was impeccable. It was such a pleasurable experience because of Customer Service and the ease of experience. Here are some pros: - Child friendly staff and super helpful. - Check in luggage of 10kg (Complimentary) - Stroller Check In ( Complimentary ) - Car Seat Check In (Complementary) - Free Basinet supplied in flight - Inclusive water hand carry for baby so it wasn’t weighed or discarded. Our trip was more smooth due to staff friendliness and always offering to help us.","positive"

"6045","Customer Service par excellence I very much enjoyed flying with Singapore, but the following put the icing on the cake for me. While flying to Manilla via Singapore I lost my wallet containing cash, cards and driving license. Having no idea how or where, I reported the fact to the crew who informed both my destination and arrival airports while still in the air. I arrived in Melbourne two days later and received a call from Singapore informing me the wallet had been located. They forwarded it to San Francisco, my next destination, and handed it to me personally. I was kept fully informed of progress and collection details on a daily basis. The wallet and contents were fully intact. Singapore and their agents went the extra mile and provided customer service beyond expectations.","positive"
"10336","I was very surprised to read some of the comments in the review below. I travelled last week from Singapore to Melbourne on an A350-900 in business class, and it was one of my better flights this year. The seat product for a 7.5 hour flight was very comfortable with good privacy (6/1 tall), and the food and beverages that I was served were all to a good standard. Service was to the usual impeccable SIA standard, and the IFE choices were excellent. I accept that everyone's perceptions can be very different, but maybe sometimes there are some other issues at play when a review is written.","positive"

I would highly recommend Singapore Airlines for international travel.","positive"

The in flight meal was acceptable (better than average actually) and entertainment system was up to date though would have like a bit more Asian selection.

But other than that, would gladly fly with them again.","positive"

"8995","Attention to detail The check in had hiccups because our names were entered wrongly. But the person at the counter was patient and smiled throughout the check in! I was seated in the middle with a stranger on my left. Usually I don't bother about that but this lady kept asking me questions throughout the flight. Worse, I could not speak her language. I tried my best to help her and I believe the head stewardess (she was in green) saw my frustration (as I could not understand her), she stepped in to assist. Even though, she could not speak the language, she tried her best to make sure the lady was alright. Kudos to SQ and the staff! My family and I did not enjoy the food though. Halal does not necessarily mean Indian food. We can have Western meals too. :)","positive"
"2604","Schoolies Trip As always wonderful service from the crew of Singapore Airways. We had a first time flyer with us and they checked in often to see how she was doing. Only downside was of course the asshat(s) who insist on dropping their chairs back in economy ( honestly pay business and stop annoying everyone) as soon as the plane levels out. Ended up with some bruising on tummy as the guy in front of me dropped his chair back while my tray was still down. Besides that amazing service.","positive"

"4496","All excellent The flight was very nice. The seat was very comfortable and there was space to leave my bag in front of the seat. The flight attendants paid extra attention. I had lobster thermidor on the flight and my glass was always filled. I was offered all the desserts they have instead of only 1 choice. But, one thing that I would suggest, the check in process is not that smooth and the staff looks like she had a very bad day. Please place someone professional as he/she will be the 1st person we meet. Overall, my choice will always be Singapore Airlines if possible!","positive"

I will definitely be using Singapore Airlines again and was particularly impressed with the A380 airliner.","positive"

"9265","Comfortable flight We were allocated seats in the top deck at the very back... perfect! Had more room and even storage and shelf to the side of my window seat. We were looked after by the immaculate air crew. Food was very pleasant , only criticism was the film choices. Not many recent films to choose from unlike Cathay Pacific . The return flight was through the night and we found the crew less attentive , possibly because of the timing ? Other than that we would choose Singapore Airlines again , but Cathay Pacific just pipped them to the post .","positive"
"9205","First experience with Singapore Airlines This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines. I usually fly premium economy on my regular visits to New Zealand but on this occasion I chose to fly economy. I was happy with my aisle seats and there was enough leg room (although being only 5ft tall that's never really an issue). The food was average in my opinion. In-flight entertainment was good with plenty of choices of films, radio and TV shows. The cabin crew were very attentive and extremely well turned out - the ladies looked so elegant and the men looked very distinguished (other airlines should take their example). My other disappointment was that the booking class I flew didn't qualify for any airpoints under the Star Alliance scheme so sadly I didn't earn any from the thousands of miles I flew to and from NZ.","positive"
"8331","Give everybody a chance to perform Pre-booking a child meal does not to ensure you get a good quality kids meal. Disgusting.I have no photos - but I am sure the catering department has and hopefully review what they send out. The same happened on our return trip to Singapore.","neutral"

"695","Good When we arrived at the airport to check in our bags there was a reasonable line of people waiting at the bag check in counters for the airline. This went down reasonably quick. The person who checked our bags in didn't seem to have the best attitude that you would generally expect to receive. Boarding the plane wasn't overly bad, the crew seemed friendly and helpful. The seats weren't too bad. There was a good choice of films and some TV programs, To access the games you have to have an account. The food wasn't too bad, did receive one meal which didn't seem to have been cooked properly so had to get to swapped. The crew came round with drinks fairly regularly and if you wanted anything you could just go to the back of the plane and ask. The hygiene felt better as not flying since covid we were concerned a bit. Overall the plane seemed newer, the crew friendly and helpful. For the return journey, there wasn't any people really waiting to check baggage in, it seems to be self bag check in. The staff on hand to help with checking the baggage in were very helpful. Boarding the plane wasn't too bad and the crew seemed friendly. The plane seemed to be older and more worn as panels especially in the toilets were badly cracked and also the hygiene of the plane didn't seem to be as good as the outward flight. The entertainment was the same as the outward flight. The crew occasionally came round with drinks. The food was ok. Overall the crew were friendly","positive"
"10285","(Two separate return journeys, different equipment). Pretty well can't be faulted. E.g. the airline staff went the extra mile in several respects, including luggage which didn't make a tight connection, but which I still got in 24 hours. The A350s are somewhat more comfortable in feel than even the A380s, the IFE on both aircraft is good, though the A350s have a live BBC news feed I can recommend. Would happily fly with them again.","positive"
"5469","My first choice for air travel The highlight of flying with Singapore Airlines for me was the tour of the city I took when having a 13hr transit stopover. Apart from Changi Airport being a fantastic airport to lounge in, the option of leaving for a few hours and seeing some sights (for free!) was a great activity. I also hired a room and had a nap and shower in that time so I was well rested for the next leg of my journey home (and the Singapore Slings went down a treat!). The airline is consistently good, the service, food and amenities made the return trip very enjoyable.","positive"
"2284","Comfortable enough, but should increase the frequency of their flights There is only one SQ flight each day between Manchester and Singapore and it is a busy route. Singapore Airlines should really consider increasing the frequency. The flight was 100% full (yes, not a single seat was left empty) and we understand that the flights on the days before and after are the same. Nonetheless, the service was good, flight was comfortable, and the whole process went smoothly. However, meals this time round was just average. For the lunch, I took the prawn and rice set, and it was mostly rice. Plus the salad was a pasta salad with all pasta and no vegetables, so the meal ended up being carb heavy with not much else. Dessert was a rather sweet tart. The breakfast was the normal eggs and hash browns. The inflight entertainment this time round was rather dry. The movies were mainly quite slow and dark, with an indie feel.","positive"
"5570","Good Service, Clean Cabins and Good Food Took SQ return to Taipei Taiwan for work, the 30kg checked in baggage of the airfare is very very helpful. If you took budget airlines, the extra charge of checked in baggage is very expensive. If you had checked-in baggage, just pick this airline. It adds up more economical at the total cost","positive"
"1335","Well done on refund Just want to give kudos to Singapore airlines for refunding us our tickets, and not taking any cancellation fees etc. We originally opted for a credit because I broke my ankle and couldn't fly because of complications but changed our minds when Covid broke out and asked them for the cash back. Great response and we will happily fly with them again as soon as the world settles down and borders are open.","positive"
"7394","Good but inconsistent service My family of five have had good experiences while travelling on flight number SQ346 on a A380 from Singapore to Zurich in Switzerland on 18 December for our holiday in Europe from 18-27 December 2018. The service on our first encounter provided by flight stewards were amazing and lived up to the high standards of Singapore Airlines especially by Mr Teo Ming Zhong and his colleagues whom we were deeply impressed. Food were great and services were first class. However, on our return night flight on Singapore Airlines via SQ321 also on a A380 on 26 December, the service provided was a let down though. Food were as good anyway as expected of SIA. The flight stewardesses attended us were of sub standard quality where simple requests like asking to remove used cups and little food containers at the very moment when they came over to serve main courses were met with blunt refusals and excuses like "" I can't do it now as I am serving food"" and the like. My request to redeem the small fruit pack were also turned down after I missed my turn when I was asleep and woke up to see the handing out of the same had just passed me a few seats in front. Reply given was there wasn't anymore left. When I insisted my share as I observed many were also bypassed during the serving round and there had to be some more available and fair enough, one of the flight attendants came back minutes later with a pack and told me on my face that this was the only one left. As the flight was a long haul of 13 hours continuous flight, I took the trouble of walking around the cabin area for some simple stretching and went to the loo and to my surprise, I saw the same little fruit packs were available in abundance both at the serving area in front of our seating section and also at the upper deck serving area together with the packets nuts, crackers, biscuits and buns. This is displeased to say the least. The service I encountered this time round was a far cry compared with the experience I had on 18 December. In addition to the bad experience of the 2 young flight stewardesses, one of the toilets at the far end on the plane has no water for washing hands and a bottle of mineral water was used as a replacement and most of the time it was emptied and no one was filling it up. I hope that being part of a group tour and be seated at the far end of a plane would not be the reason for the indifferent quality of service provided.","neutral"
"6207","just excellent The service was good and already started when we were able to board earlier because we were traveling with kids. The flight attendants were super nice and very attentive to us. It is quite a long flight and our little ones decided not to sleep. The flight attendants would come by and ask if they needed extra drinks or food. We had a great flight, the entertainment was good, food was good. It is nice that you can order a kidsmeal in advance. The kidsmeal was a really something kids eat. It is usually also served a bit earlier so the kids can eat and then you can eat afterwards.","positive"

The airline is highly service oriented and operations are almost always smooth and easy. The check-in scanner had trouble reading my passport but there was someone to help. Boarding was well-organized and disciplined, there was plenty of on-board staff and they quickly went to dim lighting shortly after takeoff. The flight arrived a little early and baggage was delivered quickly. Happy to fly them.","positive"
"3459","Wonderful airline Such a huge shame airbus will stop making the magnificent A380, by far the most comfortable plane in the skies. Took the option of premium economy on this route, more curiosity than anything else. Have previously flown economy and paid extra for exit row seats. Premium economy is good, service is better, equipment etc. (Headphones, tv screen). The legroom wasn’t great surprisingly. You get 6 inches extra though it disappears as soon as the passenger in front redlines seat. Food was good, extra also. Ice cream, beer selection. Staff are fabulous in both economy and premium. Having paid for premium economy ticket, was a little surprised to find part of my journey in economy on silk air! Only a short hop from KL to Singapore so didn’t mind too much. Can see what this airlines gets so many awards. Previously a huge fan of emirates until they introduced new seating charges, haven’t flown with them since and now fly Qatar and Singapore.","positive"
"7407","Great Airline, let down bye loathsome airport experience The airline service was exceptionally good. Attention to all passenger needs was good, in flight entertainment was great and easy to navigate. Seats were comfortable, meals were unremarkable but appropriate. Cabin crew were attentive and polite. The airport at Changi, Singapore is appalling. Dirty carpets, narrow thoroughfares, inefficient boarding procedures were just what we didn't want as we connected on our two long hauls. No excuse for an international airport, was just run down and unwelcoming.","positive"

"2388","Reserve your seats Singapore Airlines has a history of providing great service and its reputation is supposedly impeccable. However, with its recent changes to the booking system, getting decent seats without paying for one is close to impossible. On the day of check-in, only 9 seats remained available. Everyone else had already selected/paid for one and there were 0 aisle seats available. Shocking. The airlines did not reserve any seats for normal check-in and this is highly disappointing as my family were scattered throughout the plane. Given the premium prices, this really shouldn't be happening since other airlines offer better seat selections. Moreover, the food provided on Singapore airlines frequently disappoints and nothing about the airline stands out anymore. Singapore airlines have been dethroned and this is hardly a surprise. Last time flying with them.","negative"
"1095","Disappointed this time after 3 years We always fly premium economy to Singapore and usually the staff and food are amazing. On this occasion, we felt disappointed. The seats were great, but the staff were unfriendly and looked like they did not want to be there. We did Book the Cook and the food was lacking. When we asked why we didn’t get a dessert but the seats behind did, we were told it was because we had a ‘special meal’. We received no juice on arrival and no hot towels and this was because of COVID. I think using Covid as an excuse still is wearing thin. I had to ask for water on 3 occasions and they forgot to give us coffee after the meal. The seats are not cheap, therefore they should provide an adequate and appropriate service.","neutral"

"11390","I boarded the Airbus flying from London to Singapore on 18 September it was two hours late owing to technical difficulties. Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting. The steward said there had been difficulties with Apple products. Potential customers need to know this as it could be important to work during a long haul trip. I had been relatively pleased with Singapore Airlines but my experience on the Airbus has left me wandering if I would fly with them again.","negative"

We enjoyed the food and the ambience. The cabin is clean, flawless and comfortable. The cabin crew made us feel at home particularly when celebrated my niece's birthday at 40,000 feet.

"3985","I can't imagine flying international with a different airline My friend and I flew economy on Singapore air, on what I'm pretty sure was a Boeing, from LAX to INC (Roundtrip,11-hour flight) and the overall flight exceeded our expectations. Cons: -My only complaint was the trouble that we had finding our gate in LAX on the way there. On all of the screens, apps, sites, and even our tickets, the gate number wasn't there. We asked a few LAX employees and they also didn't know. We spent much of our 7-hour layover looking for the right gate. Closer to departure time we saw a Singapore Airlines plane through the window and followed it as it rode to our gate. At the gate was a small sign that confirmed that we were in the right place. The gate number never appeared on the airport screens. Pros: -The onboard service. My friend and I had some issues when booking our tickets and ended up being seated away from each other. My friend told a flight attendant about our issue and she managed to get us seated together on a fully booked flight. We ended up on the front row of a section with endless legroom. Despite there being no seat in front of us, we still had access to inflight entertainment and a table for meals. It was all tucked away inside the seat. Though I will say that these seats in the front rows will likely not be comfortable if you have big hips. -Good food. The food was surprisingly good and the desserts were really tasty. No request seemed too big. On both flights, we were served two full meals that we chose from a menu. -Extras. While boarding the flight they had a basket with earbuds that are specific to the inflight entertainment system. The entertainment system also had headphones attached. We received a small pouch that included socks, a toothbrush, and toothpaste. -Lighting and A/C. The cabin stayed thoroughly cool throughout both flights. I always bring a coat with me in case I get too cold. In between meals, the lights were turned off so passengers could rest. It was a big help to me, I was able to nap on both flights.","positive"
"10189","My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation, they generously credited me my miles back so we can re-book our trip at a later date. To me, this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles, but they did. I have flown Singapore for years, even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, consideration and rapid response. Thank you.","positive"

"11114","Singapore to Perth and return. We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name when we boarded the plane. Crew took time to make my kids feel comfortable on the flight. Cabin lights were turned off about an hour after the flight and then breakfast was served at about 4am. Unfortunately, my husband was taken ill shortly before landing – thankfully there was a doctor sitting just across the aisle from him. The crew was amazing – they thought and took care of every little detail. My kids and I were given assistance through the airport, and even helped into the taxi to go to the hospital. I didn’t manage to get anyone’s names but I am very grateful for their assistance. SQ214: Again, impressed with service. Senior crew was outstanding, some junior crew seemed a bit indifferent. Seats on both flights were comfortable and acceptable for a medium haul flight (they were angled flat seats ie. old business class). For anything more than 7 hours, a full flat would be perfect. Selected breakfast from book-the-cook for SQ225 flight, which was delicious. IFE kept the kids entertained the whole time.","positive"

"10197","World's Longest Commercial Flight, in Premium Economy Solo Seat. Bought Tickets in April. SQ Counter at EWR rather late to open, however incoming aircraft arrived late. Staff didn't know final destination, and I had to help them. No bother, as they appreciated it, and checked my Rimowa through. Cabin Crew arrived 40 minutes before boarding time. Ground staff again were novice, and boarding was kind of ""rough"" due to misplaced announcements. I was the last to board. Upon boarding was greeted throughout my walk to my seat. One Attendant even asked where I was going, smiled, and got out of the way. SQ Premium Economy Solo Seat so comfortable, and side bin holds so much. Took off on time, to a lovely sunny day. Had to use the Lavatory, and had to wait, because a Cabin Attendant was cleaning it. She noticed me, and expedited her clean. On IFE the ""Old is Gold"" section is gone, but a excess of Old movies were available, and I watched Star Wars. A drink run commenced, then Lunch. When they arrived for Lunch, the Attendant Instantly apologized, and said they only had 1 meal type however, however promised multiple options later. So I went ahead, and had it. Was tasty, followed my Ice Cream, and another drink round. I dozed off, and woke up over Denmark. Went to use the Lavatory again, however it was again being cleaned. Snack/drink runs were conducted. Really appreciate the crew on the details. Had the second meal of Iraq/Iran. I had the Seafood option. Was exceptional, hot too symphony of flavors. More drink runs followed. I dozed off again, and woke up with a Made in Italy pocket Pizza next to me. Landed SIN, to a beautiful evening. Once again SQ21, SQ23 Exceptionally shine.","positive"

Two excellent 12 hours flights good seat comfort staff service superior they walk through cabin with juice and water three times per hour staff provide a good atmosphere and spirit in cabin and at all times kept toilets clean.

On flight back to CPH captain made very thorough explanation prior to entering severe turbulence this info made many passengers feel better during the one hour rough ride. Have flown SIA regularly for 35 years still my absolute favorite.","positive"
"1042","Continuing story: Singapore Airlines doesn't like Western vegetarian passengers See all the previous reviews about SIA and their lack of service for vegetarian passengers. The food on SQ323 from Amsterdam was a disaster. Tried again for my daughter to get a better service for this leg. First don't try to get ""customer service"" by phone. After +2 hrs. waiting on the phone, you're just cut off (obviously common/normal). OK, you've got to go downtown to their ION office. Packed! Well, try today at check-in. My daughter was referred to the ticket office. Waiting! She had to dash off to get her flight to BKK. I waited in line and could finally explain the complaint to an agent. I share the conversation: Agent/A: Sir, your daughter already changed her meals. Me/M: Yes, she did. Her only option is either Chinese or Indian vegetarian, but not Western. So she had to choose Indian. A: But she also selected waffles for the flight to Amsterdam. M: She did because there was no other Western option. Waffles for dinner and breakfast. The ""Book the Cook"" option didn't offer an alternative either. A: Sir, she could select a vegan meal. M: Vegan is not vegetarian. A: (other agent mixed in) saying in Malay (which I happen to speak) ""refer the guy to the service phone"". M: (In Malay) is this how you treat your business class passengers? Why don't you Google vegetarian and vegan. After this other disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines, I left. The agent can't help you if the company doesn't offer decent alternatives for their BUSINESS CLASS passengers. If their website is one of the worst in the business, their ""customer service"" phone is perpetual busy and factually non-existent, and their focus is on non-Western passengers, don't expect their agents to be ""customer centric"" or helpful in any way. Bottom line: If you are Western, and you're a vegetarian, DON'T fly with Singapore Airlines. They do everything to discourage you to fly with them. If they treat business class passengers like this, what will they do with coach passengers?!","negative"
"6315","Flt sq 282 16 march '19 The 10 hour flight was satisfactory and the service for me sitting at seat 54 H was good,pleasant,efficient.Very happy with the outstanding service provided by flight steward Yap Shi Ting who helped me ,without asking, to place my bag onto the overhead compartment. Noticed that he was friendly,helpful and very professional when dealing with all passengers;later ,we spoke to him re our forthcoming sq flight to Kuala Lumpur on arrival at changi ,and he tried his level best to explain our questions,all correct! a confident,extroverted young man with a passion for his work! Those in his group were performing well too...absolutely no complaints! Easy check in and systematic boarding,we were given a small bag containing toothbrush and socks,2 rounds of refreshing hot towels,and several rounds of various drinks plus buns n bread etc in between the 2 main meals Food was average,nothing extraordinary,seat was rather cramped and leg room was average but still comfortable.

Is it the attitude given because I asked for night mask. WOW! ...suddenly she came to me and said ""did u ask for Singapore Sling""...i said didn't but would love one. The male steward assisting her was way more cordial and professional. As we reserved 2 Oriental Veg meal (tired of eating Indian veg for 10 days) while booking , another stewardess conveniently gave 1 to another guest ,as my brother was sleeping and too tired to consume at that time. He ended up eating a combi of both Indian & continental veg. Overall , very reluctant service.","neutral"
"168","Was hoping for more from all the hype Had to fly SIN HAN and had several choices for carriers. Heard all the hype about flying Singapore Airlines, how it supposed to be great, etc. I think the hype is gone. Don't get me wrong, it got me from SIN to HAN ok but it was a little 737 max for an international flight, was served a bento box for a meal, and to be honest I was really hoping for more. The ticket was more than say on Vietnam Air or Air Asia so I thought you really got more bells and whistles but it was just a regular flight with almost no frills. Even the excess baggage fee was quite high, you would think after paying for such a high ticket they would cut you some slack on the fees. In flight service was fine but I thought they would come around more than just giving you your ""take-away"" box. I guess all the hype that Singapore Airlines has the best service is no longer. At least I left out of T2 (versus 4) from Changi but I'll be flying someone else on those routes next time.","neutral"

"2019","Was not a pleasant flight I flew Singapore Airline from Singapore to Denpasar , 1. Staff was not really welcome at Check-in counter , no greeting , no smile and didn't say thank you , a bit racist I think since they treat us different with white people ( I saw it next to me ) 2. At Boarding , the officer staff took our drink from our bag ( caned drink ) which is not open yet, 3. During the flight , one of passenger bags carrying bottles of drinks stored above the cabin leaked and dripped quite heavily right above my seat and made my shirt wet and it was not really comfortable at all !!( and the question is why other passenger may bring drink into the cabin while they throw away my drinks that I don't even open upon boarding ) The positive think was : the senior crew and the food","negative"

"736","Long haul flights in ecomomy are tough Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world. We did several flights with them including this one which was on time. The good are the food, beverages, customer service and entertainment which are all excellent. Unfortunately where this airline and most others fail in the lack of legroom and comfort in economy where they cram in too many customers to improve the bottom line. On this long haul flight, for a tall person it is torture and uncomfortable.In future I need to review whether I fly at least premium economy or possibly business next long haul flight.","positive"

"2261","Still first airline in my heart and my choices I used this company again after 4 years from my previous flight. Actually i made two flights one from Colombo to Singapore and the second from Singapore to Hanoi. I was very relaxed and calm before the flight because i already knew that staff, service and flight will be everything fine and very well organised due to my previous experience. I wsn't wrong. Everything went smoothly. On the first leg check in was good and quick from the company, flight was excellent with an airbus a350-900, very modern, with new devices for inflight entertainment and very good service and food. The second leg it was not like the first and that why i give 4 stars instead of 5. The aircraft was a much older one a330-300 although service and check in was great. Also food was not so good as the first flight. Another minor thing that i would like to mention is the luck of salt and pepper in both flights. Regarding the airports for Singapore I can not say a word. For me is the top airport of the world, modern, modern facilities, good information everywhere, very helpful staff, decoration, clean, even toilets could be a place to eat. Regarding Colombo airport we can say that is some years back to the time. Old one not so clean. Very expensive stores comparing to the place and too many security and imigration checks, our passport got 3 stamps only for departing from the country and large rows that we were waiting for over 1 hour full of many rude locals that were pushing or making noise, unfortunately i will say it once more, locals are great and kind but some of them believe that they are something else and this ruins the great image of the country. Hanoi airport was much better, more organised although also old one. Visas were issued very quick and rows in immigration were smaller and everything was going fast. The only disadvantage is that noone helps you in anything and everyone is trying to offer you drive to anywhere instead of answering. This should change.","positive"
"973","Absolutely disgraceful airline Was scheduled to fly with this airline to Japan in May. Booked through a third party that tried to get me a refund but was unsuccessful. In addition to no refund, the airline offered me credit and when tried to use the credit, the tickets that they offered as ""alternatives"" were 4 times what you could find them online for. Absolute worst experience of my life with this airline. I would avoid them at all costs.","negative"
"5048","Great expereince The leg space, food and staff were all great.

Would highly recommend Singapore Airlines, they may have just become my favourite!","positive"
"5303","Seats are comfy. Screens are old My seat was comfortable and I had an okay sleep. The inflight monitor display, however, was very fuzzy and grainy compared to premium economy.

"10322","My recent flight from London to Singapore was very disappointing. Granted that the departure and arrival times were very good, and my seat was comfortable. Gone are the warms towels prior to your meal, no menu cards and no water runs through the flight.

No entree /dessert on meal tray. Breakfast was served 5 hours prior to landing and my meal was very poor in quantity and quality.","negative"

Without a doubt, Singapore Airlines is one, if not the best in the Sky.","positive"
"2102","Best first class service and seats Amazing service, best seats ever. To sleep and to just enjoy a trip to the city of this airline - Singapore. The 4 seats in Singapore Airline is private, perfect and the service cant be better than you dream of. I will surely travel Singapore Airline agian. Love the size of the seats, there is no airline who has bigger seats and better beds than this airline company. I had a great trip, actually I did not want to sleep at all because I was afraid to miss all the good food and service you give to your customers.","positive"
"7221","Beyond Disappointing I have flown Singapore Airlines previously and have always been happy to recommend them but a recent flight from Singapore to Brisbane has changed my opinion. This flight was really bad in a number of ways. Firstly, the seats were so squashed in, it was really very uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Previously I have found Singapore Airline’s economy sears to be spacious and comfortable. These seats had zero leg room and were very narrow. Seems like they have gone the “make more money and shove more seats in” pathway as so many airlines seem to do these days. It really felt quite unsafe and I wondered how on earth they would ever evacuate passengers safely from these cramped conditions. The second disappointment was the food - honestly I wouldn’t have served it up to my dog. It was terrible and inedible. It was obvious they had gone for the cheapest possible option which was worse than the worst cafeteria food. It was an insult to serve it to anyone. Again it seemed to reflect a desire to maximise profit while not giving a damn over really taking pride in what they served up. The entertainment system was also disappointing with a very poor choice of mostly violent and puerile movies - I struggled to find even one I would like to watch. The screens were also very old and very poor quality. The airplane itself also seemed to be old and unattractive, including the toilets which were like something out of a bad high school. No attention to aesthetics here. All in all I would struggle to fly with Singapore Airlines again and now feel no enthusiasm for this airline.","negative"

This is the type of flexibility and understanding that makes a difference. Well done !!!","positive"
"2441","To and From London on Singapore Airlines We Flew from Melbourne to London via Singapore with a stopover in Singapore on the outward and inward flights. Our flight was without incident and very comfortable as we had the wider legroom seating which we paid extra for. Service was impeccable as usual and the food was of high quality with one comment and that was that they ran out of a dish and that only left one choice which was not what we really wanted. Our stop over in Singapore was fantastic and we were able to shop, visit new places and indeed old ones as well which I well remember when I worked there many years ago. Keep it up Singapore and Singapore Airlines we will always travel and be with you.","positive"

Punctuality and state of plane all excellent","positive"
"3819","Disappointing Overall I was disappointed with my Business Class Singapore Airlines experience. When the seats are in flat bed mode they are at a strange angle making it difficult to position the pillow and sleep in a comfortable position. Also, unlike other airlines, unless you are a regular Singapore Airlines customer, you have to ask a member of the cabin crew to rearrange the seat into the flat bed mode and back again if you need to sit up for meals etc. The (vegetarian) meals were nothing special and were unimaginative and tasteless. Finally, a member of the cabin crew asked me sit upright and fasten the seatbelt when we were an hour from landing. I pointed out that this had not been requested by the captain and that I would do so as soon as the seatbelt sign lit up. Singapore Airlines would not be my first choice for any future Business Class flights.","neutral"

Food and Service were very good. The staff were wonderful. The Business Class seats/beds on this aircraft are a little hard compared to seats on other airlines which made it difficult to get comfortable on two night flights back to Turkey. IFE isn't as good as on other airlines or as good as SIA's newer aircraft but didn't affect the journey in a negative way. SIA would do well to offer pyjamas to customers in Business Class in the same way that Qantas do.","positive"
"6478","Treatment of passengers February 2018 I traveled to Beijing - economy class from Perth to Singapore and premium economy from Singapore to Beijing. Two out of the four flights I took turned out average. However the flight from Singapore to Beijing was the Gem. The staff turned over backwards for me resulting in a very pleasant flight. My return from Singapore to Perth was an absolute nasty experience. A male crew member turned that flight into an embarrassment to me and an unpleasant five and a half hours. When the supervisor came to me he too added to the embarrassment. He actually supported the bad behavior and worse customer service of the crew member. I was threatened by the supervisor that he would call the captain and I welcomed that but because he realised that I was not backing down the captain never came. I complained to the upper management at Singapore airlines and was given the cold shoulder and shove around and bribed with 15000 Krisflyer miles when the realised that again I was not going to back down. In the end nothing happened.","neutral"
"11408","Flew outward BCN-SIN via Milan as part of a MAD-KUL journey. For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that. In all entirely satisfactory product but not outstanding or memorable although customer care at check-in was well beyond usual experience.","positive"
"7988","Great service, great experience as always! My wife and I had the pleasure of flying business class with Singapore airlines recently. The experience was fantastic from check in through to disembarking. We were travelling on the A380 and it was a rather busy flight, however, the attentiveness and smiles of the cabin crew never waned and it is easy to see why Singapore flight crews are consistently rated the worlds best. My wife was pretty tired once we boarded and struggled momentarily to get her bed set up, literally in a couple of seconds we had a cabin crew member there to assist and offering any additional blankets or amenities for my wife's comfort. The food in flight was of a very good standard, we both chose the book the cook options and were not dissapointed! The range of wines available was also great and complimented the meals very well. Lounge access at both Melbourne and Singapore is also a welcome option and the food and service at both locations was very good, particularly in Singapore. From a comfort perspective, the seats are very wide, comfortable and the fully lay flat option is easy to deploy. I'm a tall guy, but found I easily fitted in the bed when it was time to sleep, albeit the range of movies on the large screen was difficult to pass up! All in all a great experience and will certainly look to fly Singapore airlines again on our next trip! The Bad: Nothing negative about the experience! The Better: The quality of the food and range of drinks The Best: The in flight service! Always attentive, with a smile and genuinely there to make sure you enjoy the flight at all times","positive"
"9491","Good But Not the Best Don’t get me wrong, this was a nice flight. But after all the press on Singapore Airlines being the top rated airline in the world I expected more from Business Class. The service was excellent but the amenities and food were not up to the excellence of Virgin, or BA, or even the new Delta planes. No toiletry bag; food choices were limited and not outstanding; bedding felt very used; wines were not great.","positive"
"2329","Superb Flew SQ478/479/118/119. All trips where outstanding and exceeded all my expectations. The cabin crew are humble and polite and ever willing to assist. The aircraft was super clean and fresh and the food was great. I always thought that the middle east carriers where the best, clearly not as SIA is. Their service levels is on another league all together. The cabin crew literally carried the flag of Singapore and gave passengers a glimpse of what the country of Singapore stands for and that they mean business when it comes to service delivery etc Have to also mention here that the Johannesburg ground team of SIA is pathetic. If you have a query and call them all they say is ""SINGAPORE AIRLINES"" and remain quiet whereas if you call airline ""XYZ"" in the middle east thay say ""hello and thank you for calling, how may we be of assistance"" this type of bad attitude at SIA will eventually lead to the loss of customers.

"10523","I don't understand why people say SQ is the best airline in the world. The service has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. I was traveling with my 10 month old daughter and husband on the non-stop from Singapore to LA (round trip). The flight attendants don't pay attention to details. They say they will wash baby bottles, but they hand back the bottle with milk still in it. So I had to request to wash the bottles myself (thankfully they allowed this). We ordered the ""Book the Cook"" meals, but the flight attendant didn't look up our info so they tried to serve us regular meals. When I told them we ordered ""Book the Cook"" meals they asked us what we ordered. I couldn't remember. Between the two of us that's 8 meals on 2 different flights that I booked in advance. If I knew I had to bring confirmation of the meal request, I would have done that. They heated up my daughter's meal without asking so it had to be thrown away because it needs to be consumed within one hour and she was sleeping because the flight was a night flight. The seats are uncomfortable for a 16 hour flight. I feel that economy plus seats for a long-haul flight should recline more. Also, the seats were really difficult for me to recline. When we boarded the plane, there was no bottled water in the water holders. Overall, it was just underwhelming. The price wasn't too bad considering it was Economy Plus and a non-stop flight to LA. I think the airline has good ideas, they just are executed properly by their staff.","negative"
"11199","My review is about the poor service in trying to get an upgrade for a segment of my Singapore Airlines flight. I purposely bought an E ticket, paying 50% more to get that class, so that I could get an upgrade, but now that I try to get the upgrade, the website tells me the ticket can't be upgraded, and I cannot get through to a human on the phone. I sent a message through their e-mail system, but only got a confirmation that it will be attended to within 10 days. This is terrible service.","negative"

"7820","Experience with Singapore airlines We started our journey at 10.45am 15.12.2018 from Chennai (India) with SilkAir SQ5335 Airbus A320 to Singapore we had pleasant experience. From Singapore we started at 8.10pm our journey to Wellington(New Zealand) via Melbourne(Australia) by Singapore Airlines SQ247 Boeing 777-200 and reached Wellington at 1.15pm on 16.12.2018. What an incredible experience... Cabin crews are so friendly and very much helpful with parental care and genuine smile. Flight served us delicious food, (we've pre ordered Muslim food) Every seat equipped with TV display for watching different languages entertainment with a remote control. Wash rooms are equipped with eau de cologne, hand wash, moisturiser, baby care table, tissues etc.,","positive"
"3444","used to be top long ago very disappointing, after quite some time I decided to use SQ again, remebering the good old days when SQ was top. not again, whereby LH improved quite significantly, SQ was pure disappointment, I did not feel welcomed but a nuisance to flight attendants and pursers on both flights (return), the wet towel was bone dry and cold, when I told them this, the second one was lukewarm but dry-means they don't even understand the purpose of that hot towel. When asked for attendance, I had to call twice and wait quite a while for a blanket, seat turn down. Wherby the SQ business sleeper seat is akward to say it mildly compared to other airlines A350,very uncomfortable and hard to sleep.","negative"

On our way from Singapore to Denpasar Bali boarding the Captain announce a technical problem with the aircraft and we have to disembark. We were very tired after a long flight from Cape Town and Johannesburg this was not the best news. The airline could have make it more tolerant if they have maybe refreshments for the passangers waiting another 2 hours for the next aircraft.","neutral"
"5864","Premium economy long flight. We thought we would try premium economy this time as business class had really gone up in price.Better than economy but still not enough room for me. The first 8 hrs to Singapore during the day was fine. We stopped over one night and flew out at 11.30 pm the following night. It was 13 hrs to Milan when we thought we could get off for an hour and stretch our legs and get a bit of exercise. However, we were not allowed off the plane. We let off passengers but did not pick any more up. They did a partial clean of the plane which was a bit strange as they could not do where the passengers were. We did 'Book the Cook"" before we left and selected our main meals. We were always served first and had a better menu than that on board so we will do that on the return trip. My husband slept well can't say the same for myself, I would call mine dozing. We are both tall so need legroom.","positive"

"10261","Manchester to Singapore flight of 12 hours 55 minutes literally flew by, helped by a decent seat but mainly because of stewardess Shirin. It was an absolute delight being served by her, she was friendly, helpful but at all times very professional. The only disappointing issue on the flight was the food which was of a poor quality and tasteless. The onward flight from Singapore was good but again the food on this flight was dreadful. My overall thoughts on this journey were very positive other than food and on that basis I have already booked again for later in the year.","positive"

"6761","Business Class I booked Singapore Airlines since my boss insisted on traveling on them. Whilst I’ve no problems with SQ, I would’ve travelled with Cathay since I’m a one world member and would’ve preferred to accumulate points under my FlySmiles number. Nonetheless, SQ we flew from Colombo - Singapore - Perth. Colombo to Singapore sector is serviced by an aging 330 and the seats were very narrow. The Singapore to Perth was serviced by a 777, where the seats was newer and was the latest product offering. I found the newer product very difficult to stretch out since I’m over 6 feet tall and one must at an angle. This was a difficulty and turning the seat into a bed needs you to get up and press all types of buttons where I was too lazy to do so. Thanks to the Book the Cook service, I was able to enjoy some fabulous lamb shanks. The food was excellent and the service, as being Singaporeans, was efficient. After flying Qatar last year, I consider the SQ service as extremely efficient but very impersonal.","neutral"
"351","Never again My sister and our partners booked our flights for our family holiday 10 months before our trip so we could be on the same flights and get the window seats we always prefer. I booked business and my sister booked premium economy and our flights went via Singpaore with a one hour layover. A few months later Singapore took premuim economy off our flight and moved my sister and partner to a flight that them meant they had a 4 hour layover in Singapore and we had to purchase separate airport transfers. A short time after that they reinstated premium economy but DID NOT offer my sister and her partner their original flights/saets back. We have tried continuously to get them back on their original flights and Singapore have not helped at all. We have emailed and called. Obviously they do not care and are happy for our family trip to now cost more for transfers and inflict an uneccessary 4 hour airport layover onto passengers with NOTHING offered to make this situation better. The bare minium would be lounge access for the four hour layover but no nothing. It is not fair that I will board my flight and see the seats my sister and her partner booked and should be seated in only for them to be filled by others who booked much later than them!! Not fair Singapore Airlines! We travel Internationally at least twice a year but all our family will avoid Singapore Airlines because they do not show any semblance of caring. It is all about the money.","negative"
"7288","Meal service was very slow I took Singapore Airlines flying from Hong Kong to Jakarta by transit in Singapore on 15 October 2018. The service from HK to Singapore had run smooth. But it was not similar from Singapore to Jakarta. By SQ 968, it supposed to take off at 8.55 pm in Singapore time, but then delay for 30 minutes. During flying, it was time to provide meals for all passengers, but I just realized that the flight attendants did it late in start. With 1 hour 45 minutes flying time, I was certain that it supposed to be enough time for them to do an excellent meal service. But in the actual conditions, seems that all flight attendants had no well plan to do it. They went rush to provide meals, and served it very slow. I was thinking that it must be done row by row until reached the end row. But, they did it randomly. Some rows had complete meals, but the rows behind those had no meals at all. With 30 minutes left before landing and the pilot announced that the flight would land soon, more than half passengers just received their meals. You could imagine that they must eat their food in a rush time including me. And awkwardly, the flight attendants seems panic, tried to get all food trays from passengers while some passengers had still eaten, and some others didn't finish the food. Couldn't imagine by myself that the 5-star airlines apparently had weakness in this concern.","negative"
"11547","We arrived in Paris today flying SYD-SIN-CDG both legs on the A380. We were seated in upper deck economy which is much better than the lower deck (quieter less people smaller seat configuration).

Staff always had a smile and were polite. Seats comfortable food not too bad for economy. Only drawback was the entertainment system could have had more movies.","positive"
"1199","Above and beyond gate service My girlfriend and I got into some trouble on our trip to Asia as our COVID test wasn’t accepted by our destination, AND we didn’t have any of our documentation (~20 documents at the time) in a hard copy form, which we realised 2 hours before departure for the international leg of our journey. Having to find a place to get the right kind of test in a city that we are unfamiliar with was pretty tough, and our documents were all over the place, too. We wouldn’t have made it on time, if not for Neda, our lovely agent from Singapore Airlines, who kept the check-in desk open for us ~25 minutes past the closing time, doing her best to manage our printing and sorting. We ran into Neda again at the gate, which she kept open for us another ~20 minutes longer than it was supposed to be, because our COVID test hadn’t arrived on time, simultaneously coordinating expectations with the rest of the staff on the radio, hotspotting us from her phone, and apologising that we had to go through all that. The results miraculously came in and we made our flight which miraculously took off just a little bit late.","positive"

Not on really for a supposedly the best airline in the world. Never encountered this problem with other airlines and hopefully never will. Calling them at Singapore from UK to report the issue incurred massive international phone bill which will offset their £35 compensation they offer.","neutral"

"4162","Good value, packaged with Scoot flight to Athens Looking for the quickest and most reasonable price for our annual sojourn, Brisbane to Athens flight. We booked via an agent a package, Brisbane to Singapore with Singapore Airlines then Singapore to Athens on Scoot. For the Brisbane, Singapore leg, we pre booked our seats in advance. We found the seat pitch quite narrow. My wife is not quite 150cm tall and her knees touched the seat in front. Similarly the tv monitors were very close. Fortunately the people in front of us did not put their seats back. The entertainment system was great with a selection of recent movie releases. The flight attendants were polite and nothing was a problem. Drink carts and drink service was great. However the quality and description of the food described on the menu and the slop that we were served were totally different. The aeroplane and flight were of the standard to be expected from Singapore Airlines. The next leg of our flight on Scoot was uneventful. Our package included 30kg of luggage plus carry on, meals and a blanket. We opted to pay an extra $50 per seat for the Scoot in Silence zone. The “Silent Zone” was behind the Business Class area. It was very quiet and isolated from the Economy section. As it is a low budget airline there were no in-seat TV monitors. However data can be accessed on board for fee. The seats were comfortable and seemed to have a larger Pitch than our Singapore Airlines flight. As part of our package we received a very smart blanket. The food included in the package was non descript and flavourless. The upside of this package is, this is a very economical and quick way to get from Brisbane to Athens. The aeroplane was fairly new. Both the Brisbane to Singapore and the Singapore to Athens legs are quick, but as the layover in Singapore was quite long we opted to stay an extra day. Apart for the poor quality food on both Singapore and Scoot flights the trip represented value for money!","positive"
"808","No compensation for a broken chair on a long flight On my flight back from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam I was given a broken chair that was unable to recline. Three stewards have reviewed the chair and regrettably informed me that the chair was indeed broken and no other seat was available on the fully booked plane. I was told I will be receiving compensation for the services not provided by email. What followed was disgusting. I received a voucher for the Singapore Airlines KrissStore of only 100 Singaporean dollar of a 1500 euro retour flight. Furthermore, the shop is outrageously expensive compared to local stores, most items are not deliverable to my country and if they are Shipping costs are 65+ Singaporean Dollar excluding Tax fees. After not providing the services you paid for they will try and steal more money from you through the bogus store compensation. After months of discussing and waiting through email support they state there is nothing they can do because there is no medical proof of injury due to the broken chair. Never again Singapore Airline.","negative"

No. Do other airlines like Cathay, Qantas etc do just as good a job? Yes.

"612","What has happen to Singapore AirlinesConstanly changing precooked flights We have previously flown with SA and been impressed by the quality of both service and overall operations.Unfortunately since the Pandemic things seem to have gone wrong. We flew to Cairns in Au last April 2022 but even before we left our flight times and dates were changed twice leaving us having to make last minute changes to accommodation and car rental at extra cost.Then they lost my suitcase for 12 days and I spent everyday trying to reach reps in various parts of Australia who seemed to only operate on mobile phones.Eventually after I had tracked the case to The Whitsunday Islands and spent several days talking to Greg,one of only three members of staff at the tiny airport it suddenly appeared on the drive of my daughters house with no notice or explanation! I was paid the grand sum of $12.45 per day as compensation after complaining. Unfortunately we had already booked two more retur flights with SA and have just returned from our latestwhich was to spend Xmas with family in AU. This too was changed several times with the initial change giving us a return date of Christmas Day! I have every sympathy with the poor young people in the contact centre who seem to have to continually cope with frustrated customers but seem to have little control over the ever changing schedule.We eventually found ourselves moved to a return flight on New Year's Eve which of course wrecked any New Year plans. This week I received two more emails from SA which changed both our outbound and return flights booked for this April,the latter change leaving us with an unwanted two day layover in Singapore where we were expected to arrange and pay for our own hotelAfter further extended calls to the contact centre we have been offered another date.However . this rearrangement offered means no extended layover but a return date of the 5th June when our original booking was for the 22nd May! What is going on.Is the published schedule simply a work of fiction. All the original flights were paid for and confirmed and booked direct with SA. But all have been changed to less convenient and wildly different dates with no explanation or compensation.","negative"
"4977","One hour of monotonous music with poor customer service After sitting on the phone for one hour, while listening to music which was on a continuous loop - I found myself wanting to rip the very hair from my scalp. The call centers could barely speak coherent English, which only made the issue more difficult. We asked to speak to their manager, but alas, they didn't know what that was. And what was even more entertaining, they hung up whilst we were on hold! Clearly the company lavishes itself on it's own luxuries of being one of the most renowned airlines in the world, but obviously lacks common sense when it comes to being decent human beings that can manage a customer with getting their flights booked and confirmed! We are still attempting to get this flight confirmed, booked and ready to go - we have a time limit till the end of the day as the tickets are getting issued at 11pm tonight, but so far, it seems that the flight we paid good money for - won't even be for us. Thank you Singapore airlines, for your incompetent customer service which makes those with the strongest of wills want to give up on life. This somehow makes Tiger airlines and Jet Star seem more reputable. Not good.","negative"

"6617","Good flight from London to Perth via Singapore Last week I flew Singapore Airlines from London Heathrow to Perth, with a stopover in Singapore Changi airport. The first leg of the journey (LHR - SIN) was fantastic, the flight left (and arrived) ahead of schedule, thanks to a speedy boarding process. The plane was modern and comfy and in Economy, passengers received the standard pillow and blanket, along with a toothbrush and a warm pair of socks for the flight, which I thought was a nice touch! The staff were very helpful and friendly. Food was served at three occasions and was very tasty (I had Gluten-Free meals but it seemed like there were also good options for those without dietary requirements!) The entertainment was pretty good, there were quite a few new releases (film and TV) but I had unfortunately already seen most of them! All in all, the first leg was fantastic. The second part of my journey was (SIN to PER) a little disappointing, especially following the great 1st flight.. The staff were friendly but quite disorganised, meaning that prep for taxiing and take-off took a while, as did the food service. We only had one meal, which was pretty tasty but faced with a number of special diet requests, the staff seemed underprepared. This resulted in everyone waiting for their food for a very long time (especially those with no specific diet needs). The entertainment was the same as on the first flight. I would also add that I had to wipe down my tray table, armrest and entertainment remote with sanitiser on flight no. 2, as they did not seem clean at all :( Overall I had a good experience and I would certainly recommend flying with Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"9369","Singapore Airlines ..Again! I admit to bias but still cannot deny that SQ does deserve the accolades it is showered with ! The recent flight I took only reaffirmed my loyalty - I refer particularly to the ground staff’s assistance in retrieving a checked baggage I had left behind after I had left the security area and checked into the adjacent hotel at Haneda. It was all done within a short space of time and self- imposed anxiety overcome, it became a pleasant experience I’d “A Great Way to Fly!” SQ, try and Ensure Premium Economy does not feel like the “sandwich class” on both outward/inward bound sectors the seats don’t recline easily or comfortably - I hope the cabin crew fed back !","positive"
"5913","No Wonder Why Its #1 First off Singapore Airport is one of the best in the world. Lots of shops, resting places, an inside bird & butterfly enclosure with lots of space. The pre board area has many comfortable seats and places to use free wifi. The plane was clean, safe music played as we boarded. We were lucky and were seated in the emergency row. Lots of leg room. We I plugged in there were 320 movies to watch, music to listen to or TV shows to catch up on. As luck had it when they were serving lunch they ran out of the fish and chicken we had ordered. No problem, the head steward went into first class and brought us meals from there. Yum yum! There were no other problems, smooth flight and easy exit when we arrived in Taipei.

"1004","Bad Policies, Slow Service Incessant reminders to wear a mask and pull it up over your nose. All while being asked to share a medical exemption if you don't (which is illegal by the way to ask for and can be kept private between yourself and Dr. if you wish, like any medical information). Not to mention the masks they hand out are completely ineffective as are 99% of all masks used (cloth, N95, surgical). Just search on duck duck go, 150 studies proving masks are completely ineffective and often increase transmission (don't get your info / commentary from news sources / gov sites). So this political issue, passed onto airlines to mandate is deplorable with no leadership by a private comoany nor evidence based logic. Just wear it and be good. Just because they tell you to, doesn't mean it's right or lawful because it's not. Meals also took forever to be collected so sat for way too long while everyone just wanted to get back to sleep.

Singapore Airlines is a really good airline, and the stop over at Changi airport is fine. Buy Duty Free at Changi! I fly this route often and find that taking a night flight often means that there are empty seats so I've usually had a row to myself. The food is excellent and the cabin crew are usually very friendly. The entertainment is disappointing in my opinion so I download stuff onto my laptop before flying. Also irritating is the fact that to book a seat you have to pay. Luggage allowance is a generous 30kg.","positive"

The flight attendants were extremely polite, helpful and ensure the passengers are feeling good. They go at periodic intervals to check whether we need any drinks or special requests. The seats are very comfortable, spacious and not congested. Coupled with wide selection of inflight movies. All in all an enjoyable flight. Singapore Airlines will be my priority airline option for future long distance travel.","positive"
"8908","Great Airline I love flying with Singapore airlines one of my favourite. The Flight attendants are elegant and classy and handle themselves with poise.

This time total opposite From Frankfurt to Singapore the aeroplane was not clean ; carpet etc ,but we tried to ignore and fall a sleep .However the second half of our trip was even a bigger disappointment. We were simply told :if we are asking for Dinner there wont be breakfast for us .....??????If we choose breakfast it wont be served dinner ????? For a very reputable airline paying $15000.00 very unusual.Nil beverages. What is happening :administration is going wrong ????","negative"

"10873","Jakarta to Singapore. This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines and I was impressed. The flight was on time, the cabin crew was friendly and courteous. The cabin was really clean. It was a short haul flight which only lasted for 1 hr 45 mnt but really enjoyable. The food was decent for a short haul flight. It has 3-3-3 seat arrangement which is great and the legroom was spacious. I wish they could improve more on the flight entertainment system because even though the movie selection was great and had many new titles the touch screen was not responsive and the earphones were not comfortable enough","positive"

I am very disappointed with your ground staff at Tan Son Nhat International Airport .I had a horrible experience at the check-in counter. My flight was SGN to Zurich. ground staff, Ms.Pham thi Hoang Anh, had no idea of the regulations and entry requirements of foreign nationals to Switzerland. A very low level of knowledge and poor service. MsPham thi Hoang Anh,told me that Israelis must show their departure flight from Switzerland. Israeli citizens do not need exit flight tickets from Switzerland. She updated me that she had called the manager of Singapore Airlines and it would take him more than two hours. Maybe more I told her I would miss my flight. I felt I was having a heart attack! I asked him to give me the boarding pass. She refused! I do not recommend booking a flight with Singapore Airlines.","negative"

Kids meals very tasty that even my daughter who is a very picky eater had no problems finishing the generous portions. Specialised headsets for the kids as well as some activity materials too. IFE acceptable and adequate to keep the young ones entertained for the 3 hour flight. Well worth the money.","positive"
"677","Cancelled flight and would not rebook Singapore Airlines cancelled the flight and was placed on a waitlist for a new flight, blocking all the website functions from cancelling or changing flights. After contacting them three times (email twice and chat function once) h and waiting two weeks for a response, I have still not received a call or new flights. As the last straw, I bought a local sim card and tried calling the helpline. I was on hold for an hour, and then the line disconnected. I understand things might be difficult if I want to change my flights, but I am shocked at the response from Singapore when they cancelled the flights. I will never fly with this carrier again.","negative"

The service and attention details made the two long flights seem easy. The food was superb. the selection of drinks - non alcoholic and alcoholic was great. The snacks available was also impressive. The seat pitch was good. The entertainment on offer was also great. I can see why they are the worlds best airline. We have flown with many other airlines but Singapore Airlines is without doubt the best from our experience.","positive"

We felt there was more leg room than on other airlines we have used and the meals were especially tasty.","positive"
"7451","Typically enjoyable flight and service BNE lounge had a good variety of tasty options, the plane left on time and food was OK. The entree and dessert not wonderful but the fillet steak for a main was very good. Service was consistently responsive.

"2488","Family-friendly and great air crews I've traveled with kids on Air Asia so of course the difference would colossal. But never thought it could be this good and left long-lasting impression on us. The price is almost the same with Air Asia, taking into account bulkhead seats, food and luggage - but the service is way better. Firstly, the air stewardess really made us feel like home, with great service and endless smile. Even when I am stressed out with handling two kids under 4, they're always cheerful and helpful which made the stress went away instantly. They provided toys for my kids, and there was a time when I was handful, they offered to clean my baby bottle. They are also very attentive, offering to reserve my food while I take turn with my husband feeding our boys. They also offered complimentary seats with bassinet for the whole family, which has large legroom, enough for my kids to play on the floor. As well, they way they designed the seats on the bulkhead row, allow for a flexible arms rest instead of fixed one, which I can pull up, and allow my eldest son to lie on me. The food, despite Muslim Meal are very tasty, unlike other airlines who tend to serve sub-quality halal food. But I would complain on the selection for the baby jar food, which I would suggest to offer halal ones as well (or at least seafood or vegetarian). They offered us two jarred baby food with beef, and one with mixed fruits. Unfortunately I can only feed my son the mixed fruits one. Luckily I have already brought pouch food to last for the whole flight. As well, they only serve lunch about an hour after take off (around 3 pm SIN time), and only crackers before arriving around 9.20 pm (8.20 pm SIN time). By the time we've arrived with the immigration, picking up the luggage and chasing for the last train from the airport, it is already late in Osaka and past our dinner time and seriously hungry. We had to feed our boys while queuing up for the immigration. Luckily the stewardess gave us some more biscuits before touch down noticing how cranky our boys are from hunger. Would suggest to at least serve sandwich or pies before arriving. Regardless, will definitely fly with them again.","positive"
"9861","The days of free upgrades have gone, bidding for Premium Econ Singapore air now offer you a bidding lottery to upgrade a class on available sectors. We guessed a fair price for the final leg of our journey from Singapore to Brisbane and were successful in moving to Premium Economy. Very much more comfortable seats than economy, with lots of leg room. Meals not much difference. However we are now converts and may well choose premium Economy for the longer legs Singapore to London and reverse. This also would let you skip the horrendous Heathrow bag drop (took us 2 hours in a queue - premium economy check in with Business class - no queue at all!","positive"
"8255","Utter waste of time Am currently stuck in the plane from CGK to SIN. Flight was supposed to depart at 210pm but was delayed to 3pm due to bad weather in Singapore. What??? If we had flown, could the skies not have cleared by the time we reached Singapore which is 1.5 hours away? By the time 3pm came, was informed that it be (maybe) another 1.5 hours before we can take off. As I said, we could have touched down at Changi by the time we even get to fly now. Would definitely not recommend SQ because of this in my mind, unnecessary delay.","negative"
"664","Very deceptive, crap service, not covid safe, disgusting food, paid 9 dollars for water I went from phnom penh to Singapore then to Singapore to Melbourne. From Singapore to Melbourne 300 mls of water cost 9dollars, the seats were hard and cramped, the meal was absolutely disgusting and no attempt had been made to hide it was microwaved, the ventilation felt poor (definitely not covid safe), no entertainment. Worst flight experience ever. Staff were extremely unfriendly at the luggage drop off. When I went from Melbourne to Singapore the Australian women who worked for the company was yelling at us like we were cattle and she had a very patronising tone with some other customers which I felt was almost racist. This occurred because Singapore airlines changed my flight from Singapore to scoot. They still charged me as though it was a Singapore airlines flight. They even printed my ticket out with the Singapore Airlines logo. I don't get why companies can't just be straight up honest with you about there product? Like if it was going to be a scoot flight then just say that? I'm sure it was written in the fine print, which covers them in other areas, but not in common decency. They even printed ""Singapore airlines"" on my boarding past. Anyway, in my books definitely not a good, reliable high quality company. They will change your flights around and don't care about quality.","negative"
"7628","Fantastic Layover Services The crew are just amazing. I eventually planned a long layover to go for sight seeing in Singapore. At the airport, they offer free tours, or you can just use the train connected to the airport and go for a quick peek to famous spots.

"1688","Excellent Flight I've always been very proud of Singapore Airlines being Singapore's own International Airline. I would like to commend on a senior crew which for the 1st time I have very good impression of how this senior steward tried to make contact and he was very friendly and made passengers who walked past him felt so comfortable and at ease. He will cracked some jokes and this definitely helps those who have flight phobia to felt at ease. He was also very helpful and offered passengers who needed help willingly. Though my flight was just a short flight of about 2 hours, I would say, this is 1 of the BEST experience I had with Singapore Airlines. Thank you for that friendly gestures and your kind & helpful attitude in serving.","positive"
"3702","Still one of the best I’d heard a couple of reports that SA had gone downhill a bit but I’d had no issues in previous flights myself but was interested to see how they would do as I hadn’t flown with them for a couple of years. I am happy to report that I found the seats comfortable and the service excellent. I was particularly impressed with Valerie (in flight crew) who was charming and appeared genuinely happy to help with anything. Having said that all the crew were pleasant and worked hard. The reason I have given 4 stars and not 5 is purely because the flight was cold. The crew had tried to adjust the air con but couldn’t - even they were cold! So very happy to have had a good flight but take layers for the possible air con extremes!","positive"
"779","Night and Day with BA - Wow, thank you! Regular BA flyer (nothing wrong with them, by the way) but my experience with Singapore Airlines has blown me away. Helped me with a premium economy multi-trip plan, which BA doesn't have on its website, and then gave us front row seats when it wasn't possible to seat us together during one leg of our flights. Took about 45 seconds for someone to pick up the phone, and they did all this proactively and called me back the next day. I wasn't expecting this level of service but was blown away. Shout out to Evi, thank you!","positive"

They were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a little cramped but not unbearable. I was able to get comfortable and nap so not to bad. I would definitely fly on Singapore again.","positive"

"7294","Interesting Experience Where was the up beat and positive enthusiasm that SQ is always known for, one might ask, had you been on SQ 221 on the 31st of July 2018. Something lacked in the service which made the flight forgettable even though it was on their latest A388 operating the inaugural flight that very day! The food? Forgettable to say the least. Biggest disappointment being the cold breakfast they served. While the seating, cleanliness and IFE prove that the airline well and truly deserves its repute as a 5 star airline, the service left a little bit to be desired.","positive"

"1861","Great experience flying from Hanoi to Singapore We were lucky as it was the launch of A350 aircraft for this route by SIA. To my 5 year old's great delight, everyone was given a SIA A350 toy bear as souvenir for the launch. For me, it was a great delight because there's personal entertainment center provided now (most airlines don't have this for short haul). My kid just entertained himself by jumping movies in kid channel and leave me be with with my own channel. The food was tasty (love the curry chicken and mash potatoes). Kid was a little disappointed as I told him there'd be ice scream, just like Silkair but it's not available. Air crews as usual are nice and courteous, they give kids their food first so it's great (no more Mommy, when it is my turn for food, I'm Huuuunnngggry...). Traveling with kid short haul would be so easy now :)","positive"
"7977","Bring on the A350!! Connecting to ANA Good food preordered by Book the Cook Lots of Charles Heidsieck champagne but for 7 hours this business class with slant beds is very dated Good lounges in ADL and Sin Will be much better when they put the A350 on this route","neutral"
"8329","Long haul fllght Was travelling in premium economy class for return trip. Technically speaking there is plenty of legroom in this cabin. Unless you are sitting in priority seat there is not much legroom once the passenger in front of you starts to recline his seat. This was what happened to me when my friend was occupying the window seat and I had to stand for her when she wanted to visit the bathroom because of the reclined seats in front of us. The amount you spend on premium economy is not worth because of this reason. The bathroom was very clean initially but towards the end of the flight it became dirty as I could see tissue paper popping out of the bin and the crews did not really bother to clean it. This was especially for flight from SIN-FRA-SIN. Overall it was a good experience as the cabin crews were very attentive and did their best to serve the passengers.","positive"
"1277","Mr. After not flying for almost 7 months I finally take my first fight again from Hong Kong to Singapore. The entire process was a very pleasant one. I arrived at the airport and checked in very smoothly. The Singapore Airline lounge is closed but they diverted me to the Traveller Lounge bear Gate 6. The service was very good. When it come to boarding. The airline specially arranged for all the transit passengers to be boarded first as they were seated at the end of the plane. Then follow by the rest of the passengers. There was no mixing of the two groups of passengers and all necessary precautions was well taken. I was also given a personal safety bag with hand sanitizer, mask, etc inside. There were normal food served on the plane as before Covid 19. I landed in Singapore and the whole journey ewe a very pleasant one. Singapore airline has done a great job in ensuring all the passengers have a pleasant flight with safety placed at high premium.","positive"
"2561","New aircraft experience! My wife and I travelled economy Brisbane - Singapore - Munich and returned London - Singapore - Brisbane with Singapore airlines. Three of the flights were on Airbus A350-900s and the london - Singapore was on an Airbus A-380. The staff service on the first leg to Singapore was, I believe not up to the airlines standard where as the last 3 legs the service was great. The ground services in each airport was excellent from check in to luggage pick up. The Airbus A350-900's were new aircraft but I found the seats (Economy) were to thin and as a result lacked padding and as a result were not as comfortable as other aircraft I have flown on. The A380 was showing its age but the seating (economy) was comfortable to fly in. The best part of the trip was the London - Singapore leg on the A380, the worst part was the comfort of the A350 seats and the inflight service from Brisbane to Singapore ( the menu handed out was for the Singapore - Bombay route)","positive"

"3923","A tight squeeze ! Having flown Adelaide to Singapore with Singapore Airlines at least a dozen times I must say my most recent experience was the most uncomfortable. The A350 plane has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so that ,unless you are extremely thin or a child the tray table will not sit flat. Also if the person seated in front of you puts their seat back it is almost in your face. The staff were their usual friendly and efficient selves and the flights were on time.","positive"

"4860","Nearly Excellent Returning to Brisbane via Singapore - Staff are very friendly. The seats in Business, while vertical, are quite comfortable, lots of little places to stow items and the chest belt is a little strange but just another gadget I guess. The flatbed however isn’t designed for sleeping. The little blanket is only big enough to cover a child so sleep is a not a great experience. The worst thing about this flight was an Australian couple who boarded after us, and had the middle aisle seats - on Singapore these mid seats pairs are sited close together then the next set are further apart (not far though - maybe a 12”/30cm divider) and they were given the set with the divider. The wife started as soon harassing the flight staff as she was seated and loudly. I have never been so ashamed to be an Aussie - “she needed to be near her husband, when we’re these seats fitted into Singapore, how could you expect a couple to sit so far apart” on and on it went. Until the Aussie couple in front stood and said they were happy to swap Immediately the woman in question cast a filthy look at the flight staff and moved, told them to move her belongings and continued to treat the staff very poorly through out the flight. Very poor behaviour and the staff were taken up at a very busy time (take off) with one very rude, demanding, awful woman. Never seen it before, hope to never see it again. Meals are on par with any airline BC - they were served hot, quickly and far too often :)","positive"

My baggage was marked priority so came off with the first batch. On the plane, the seats are spacious, the leg room also spacious. What is nice is a foot/leg rest that comes up to support your legs. The food is good, and the service excellent. The bathrooms are always clean - unlike other long distance airlines where the lavatories get a bit gross after 6-8 hours. This airline is well worth the price.","positive"

Ill start with the best part of the flight, the staff! From the moment we boarded till the time we left the crew made this flight as comfortable as possible for us. A special thanks to Chui, our stewardess who personally looked after our every need, thanks. The seats were comfortable and lie flat for sleeping but you have to angle your legs into a little cubicle, which being 6’3” was a little tough, but it sure beats premium economy. The food was plenty and often and pretty good for airline food. All said we look forward to our return flight in 3 months time!!","positive"
"1002","My worst experience with singapore airlines I always have a great time flying Singapore airlines with friendly flight attendants and a great seat and that wasn’t different about this flight but it was delayed 8 hours and I missed my connecting flight which they weren’t able to put me on another Singapore airlines flight like every other time but instead put me on a budget air Asia flight for 5 hours which was a horrible experience but in Johannesburg where I was flying from they only gave us an 150rand food voucher at one specific restaurant before security and that is around 15 Singapore dollars and the food voucher wasn’t even enough for one meal and the delay went over lunch and dinner so I had to spend quite a bit of money and the virgin Atlantic lounge was closed and with the krisflyer card I had I was able to go there but since it was closed I had to pay 400rand to get access to a lounge which was mediocre at best and the other thing that I hated was that they told us to come to the gate for boarding when the plane hadn’t even landed in Johannesburg from Cape Town so I had to wait 1 hour to board when I could have just stayed in the lounge which was much more comfortable but still the actual flight was great like always but Singapore airlines should have done better with their management of the flight being delayed and there were many people who didn’t have lounge access and other things that I had so I think their time was probably much worse than mine and this is the first bad experience I’ve ever had with Singapore airlines and I think you should still fly it as it’s usually great and this is the only bad experience I’ve ever had.","negative"

These flights were like a natural extension of our vacation! We were truly pampered by the steward/esses.

The staff kept us very hydrated on the flights. Always offering water and orange juice frequently through out the flight.

"11331","Flew IST-SIN SIN-SYD on B777-200. One of the aircraft had been ""refitted"". Both had quite hard seats. For the first sector I was seated in 51A which on a night flight gets a direct beam of light coming from the toilets on a regular basis. It's quite disturbing and I wouldn't recommend this seat to economy passengers in this part of the cabin. The inflight entertainment is dated and the screens quite small compared to other aircraft in the SIA fleet and other airlines particularly the second sector where the screen was exceptionally small. This must have been one of the oldest aircraft in the SIA fleet. It seems SIA reserve their ageing aircraft for the IST route. The inflight service on both legs of the journey was very average. I ordered a special meal so received my meal first however it took over an hour to get a drink to go with my meal which is served when the rest of the meals are served. I think there is some room for improvement here from SIA. I was surprised to have to remind the cabin crew about my missing drink as normally their service is second to none. The food was fine and well above average although the coffee not always hot. Check in staff were quite good at IST and as with almost every flight I have ever taken departing from Ataturk Airport it was a delayed departure - this flight by 45 minutes.","neutral"
"8416","Perfect flight with the new Airbus A350-900 A fligth time of 12h on a beuatiful plane can be bridged with the care of SA! The motor noice is indeed very low. The care of the SA crew is outstanding!","positive"
"9788","Disabled friendly airline and very communicative supporting office staffs We travelled as a family of five on 25th of June. Our little daughter is disabled and need extra arrangement prior the trip date. I sent email to the office staff to let them now my daughter's medical condition .I got the reply within 24 hours from their local and Singapore office staff to advise what to do so that I would had a smoothest flight. With clear information do and dont from the staff as well as good communication we had, indeed our trip was smooth and no problem at all. Checking staff at Heathrow airport, I forget her name, she is very nice lady and helpful . She greeted us with broad smile and helped us with clear information and direction on how to get to the departure gate as the location was quite walk distance from the check in counter. Upon entering the aircraft, all crews members greeted us with warm hospitality and one of them arranged and made sure my daughter's buggy kept safely in their luggage storage . Overall we enjoyed the long haul of 14 hours flight ( 2 hours transit in Changi Airport Singapore). The crews were excellent. The journey were smooth as velvety cake in my mouth ! Will travel again with Singapore airlines, for sure.","positive"

We go to Asia every 2 to 3 years and SIA is our first choice!","positive"
"489","Ground staff Singapore Airlines incompetent Here are my details of my trip. 2nd March, 2023 – I flew with Delta to JFK in order to connect with Singapore airlines – JFK-FRA-SIN-HKT , due to arrive 4th March, 2023. When I arrived at JFK, on my way to collect my luggage I saw a Singapore desk in the area. So, I decided to stop and ask for directions: where to get my bag and where to check in with Singapore airlines. It was staffed by 2 individuals. While asking for directions and informing them that I will pick up by luggage from Delta and bring it across to the check-in desk. They both told me that it wasn’t necessary, just show them my Delta tag and my itinerary and they will have my luggage picked up and delivered to Singapore. I asked them twice if they are sure because Delta is not Star alliance. However, my luggage wasn’t picked up from the Delta carousel. 3rd March, 2023 – Attempt to ask and verify my luggage was on board to a Singapore rep in Frankfurt, where I was told that she was too busy to help me I should come back later. 4th March, 2023 – I arrived in Singapore and I went to T2 service desk (near F30) and was told that my luggage is in the system, it would arrive in Phuket. I arrived in Phuket but my luggage was missing, I was first told by the ground staff in Phuket that it was in Singapore and would arrive the next day and that I should make a claim. I did just that. 5th March, 2023 – I waited 2 days before I realized that I was receiving no assistance from Singapore airlines except for e-mails stating that they are sorry for the delayed baggage. That’s when I had to take action on my own. I received this message about 10 times over the past few days. ""We are still trying to locate your delayed bag(s) and will provide another update by tomorrow. You can also check the status here, with your reference number."" 6th March, 2023 – I decided to check myself to locate my luggage and found it on Delta’s website, I then tried to call Singapore – JFK and inform them of the situation and this is when they told me that they couldn’t help me and hung up the phone when I asked to speak to a supervisor. Erroneously thinking that since I found the luggage that I would receive some help as I have been without clothes, toiletries and medicine for 2 days. I finally got through to Singapore JFK via e-mail and they now asked me for a photo of my bag and of my flight details and boarding passes before they can help me. How bizarre? Questions for Singapore Airlines: 1. Why was I told by JFK ground staff that my luggage on Delta airlines would be transferred to Singapore airlines, when it wasn’t. Even though I offered twice to retrieved my luggage myself the two staff members insisted that it wasn’t necessary as it will be handled. It wasn’t and of today 9th March, 2023 I still don’t have my luggage. 2. Why is it at FRA airport where I was in transit that no staff was at the Singapore desk for most of the day. I did manage to find a person at the gate that told me they were too busy to assist me – I wanted to verify that my luggage was indeed transferred. 3. Why was I told when I arrived in Singapore by the staff at the service desk (next to F30) that my luggage was in the system and would be at my final destination – Phuket. 4. Why could the ground staff at Phuket airport and Singapore airline online unable to find my luggage and kept sending e-mails that they have contacted every station for information. 5. Why is it that when I called the Singapore customer service at JFK airport in NYC they told me that they can’t help me and hung up on my call. 6. Most important – Why is it when I located the luggage myself 2 days later – as it was with Delta and informed all parties that my bag was in JFK Delta office that no personnel from either Singapore office made any attempt to retrieve my luggage. I had to call Delta in Atlanta and ask them to contact Singapore ground staff at JFK and inform them that the luggage they are looking for is at JFK.","negative"
"3091","Not the quality or Service I expect Having Flown Singapore Air many times before, the service standard appears to have fallen. This was experienced on all of four flights. Whilst entertainment was good the main quality wasnt there, Provisions have reduced in quality and what you get. Food has dropped in standard and they didnt have the choice many people wanted on all of four flights. They need to learn what meals are popular, it isn't hard, but this seems to be cost-saving they are doing. The people who pay extra for legroom at the front like me seem to get worst deal being served last, with cold food and no choices. The food is no longer great, a continental breakfast was six bits of chopped fruit (4 apple) a dry roll and muffin - Thats it. No cheese, ham, yogurt, cereal, etc. They dont come round as often with drinks and snacks on the long flights. I will be choosing another airline next time.","neutral"
"3193","Contradictions Return flights via Changi. A350 -900 in all sectors. Outward flight excellent in service, food and general comfort in both sectors; inward flight excellent in service and general comfort, very average in food. I would recommend this airline. The A350 is a superior aircraft in comfort compared to B787. I particularly liked the seat recline, seat as well as back moves, thus avoiding a pet dislike,i.e. the passenger who reclines seat back so far that there is no room to get in & out. Changi airport is extremely impressive and spotlessly clean.","positive"

They provide a mini-pillow and a sheet.","positive"
"6002","Not the usual standard, although still good I set the bar very high with SQ and this flight did not really deliver. The quality of food was not good and they were not able to offer everything on the menu - so no fresh juice or fresh fruit. People drinking wine got non stop refills but because I was drinking juice, it seems they just wanted to clear my things away and ignore me. Of course, I could ask for more, but it seems strange they are less keen to serve non alcoholic drinks compared to alcoholic drinks. An older plane with lower standards maybe.","positive"

"7164","Not what they used to be We have used this airline numerous times over the past decade, but feel that the standards have dropped markedly. The food was very ordinary, the wine too and choice was limited. Premium ecomony seats are definitely better than economy, but having flown with another Asian airline on their PE seats, it was not in the same class. Staff are pleasant, but with a couple of exceptions, not friendly or welcoming. Their rewards programme must be of the worst around, with its complete lack of flexibility, and poor and expensive purchase options.","neutral"

"5290","the long long flight Flight took off at 2330 hours and as passengers in the packed plane settled for some sleep about 2 hours later, the pilot announced that the plane was heading back to Singapore because of technical issue. Eager queries were made to the cabin crew about connecting flights, reason for turning back, and delay in appointments. Only after sometime was it revealed that the flight team has found the oxygen mask not in operation mode, and after deliberation it was decided that the best option was to fly back to Singapore, where the airline will try to get another plane to replace this. Only when we reached Singapore we were informed that a replacement was arranged to fly us to Spain a few hours later. The SIN to BCN trip is about 12 hours, add in another 9 hours, it was 21 hours flight! Our holiday was almost ruined. It was salvaged by a planned easy first day in Barcelona.","positive"

We were actually able to talk to each other without me (smaller one of us) climbing on my knees to speak to my partner. The wall between us was lower than the old version of the plane and during the night we were able to sleep next to each other as if at home. Yes, we loved that.

The overall ambience of the cabin is bright and airy, and the newest version of the in-flight entertainment is a big bonus for this short hop flight. Seating is comfortable for this duration of flight (way better than the experience in an A320 or B737). We left on time, and the crew were then rushing to serve breakfast. Food was reasonably good (omelette or nasi lemak), and we landed on time also. Crew were a little rushed and courteous rather than friendly, but good enough. I appreciated that the crew were meticulous about asking passengers to raise their seats to the upright position for the meal service, small things like this help in economy.","positive"

"1589","Still my favourite long haul airline Chose this airline, because it has a daytime flight from Singapore to Sydney, and I find it helps with jet lag to arrive at night. Have used Singapore a few times, and the service is exceptional. They get your name straightaway, and they ""pamper"" you in the best possible manner. Nothing is too much trouble, the food is great, as is the choice of wines, and if you get stuck with the entertainment system, they are delighted to find anything you want. I find the airport lounges good too. They always have a wide selection of food, there is loads of space, and the area is well laid out, so that it is easy to find a quiet corner. Their coffee is good too.","positive"

My return flight was spoilt by the fact I was in crutches after an accident and in a great deal of pain. The crew couldn't have done more to assist me both on the ground and in the air. I was accompanied by a ground crew member during the refuel time to do duty free shopping in Singapore Airport, if only the same help had been provided in Gatwick. Sadly Gatwick provided an unhelpful, lazy, rude and selfish person who insisted I get my own luggage. And get from the terminal to bus station myself.","positive"

One passenger in our row being moved up front for the flight. Friends in Premium Economy upstairs said their air conditioning was fine but did note that the air from economy rising up the rear stairwell was cold. Take note that we were travelling under a travel group booking.","positive"
"10682","Overnight flight delayed in takeoff due to airport congestion brought on by inclement weather. On boarding the large number of passengers on this oversized aircraft was impressively quick and smooth. Flight attendants were elegantly efficient - the female flight attendants were strikingly lissome. Sitting configuration was 3-4-3. Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard. Bathrooms were clean throughout. A good option over Lufthansa or United. Arrived more or less on time after a somewhat bumpy flight.","neutral"
"9724","Paris and return in Premium Economy with SIngapore Airlines Premium Economy. Not always the best value. I do believe the best value price on Singapore Airlines for premium economy would be aproximately 50% to 60% more than the standard economy fare. The good things I found were express check in (but not at every airport), 35kg baggae allowance (now that was good) and an express lane at some airports for boarding. The food was very good with agood range and you could order specifically what you want on line up to 24 hours before departure. The seats were wider than economy with extra leg room however at 6'3"" (191 cm) I still couldn't stretch out completely or utilise the leg support. The seat belt on one flight was very thick and could be uncomfortable. I believe it contained an airbag. Cabin staff were helpful and always polite. Plenty of overhead locker space. One thing I found strange was having to walk back through the first section of the ecoomy cabin to get to the toilet. Unlike First and Business class there is no specific toilet for Premium Economy. You have to pay for WiFi on board if you want it. Bags were off loaded as priority at the destination which was helpful when arriving home and getting into the customs line up a little earlier than normal. In all Premium Economy (at the right price) was much better than travelling Economy and with Singapore AIrlines I haven't had a bad flight yet. Even in economy.","positive"

"8139","It's Great! The plane we had, Dreamliner 787 was a new plane and that makes alot of difference to the entire flight experience. The screen is touch screen so bye bye to that cumbersome telephone lookalike remote control. The screen was bigger and the intense graphics colour makes viewing movies more pleasurable. There's a USB port to charge your phone, and also powerpoint at the base of the seat in front of you to charge your laptop. The flight from SG to Narita is 6.5hrs and there's 2 meal servings. One is a flatbread with chix served about an hour or more after take off. The other is a set breakfast served at 4am where we get to choose scrambled egg with sausage and potato or Japanese breakfast which I dont know whats in that menu. Sit on the left of the plane if you are flying to Tokyo for a chance to see Mount Fuji. On your return, sit on the right for the Mount Fuji view.

"6384","it is still good, but other airlines started to get better SQ business class used to be known as one of the best. but I can say I would prefer JAL or Emirates for now. I would point best items that SQ is still number 1, the food and the hospitality. JAL would be a competitor to watch, they serve great food. SQ flight attendants were one of the most friendliest I've ever interact with. Although I did get some unpleasant reaction when getting on board with my backpack and dusty boots. Amenities? My best would be JAL, it provided many things from luxury toiletries set, slipper, soft fabric cardigan, to noise canceling headphones. SQ? all those minus the toiletries set and cardigan. Yes, they had stop giving away the toiletries, even for longer routes like Singapore - Dallas. Seat comfort also been rather declining a little - or maybe it depends on the series of the plane. this one was a bit narrower than I though, couldnt flip my self to the other side. But it is indeed still one of the best three i would use :)","neutral"
"3139","Surprisingly Disappointing I had high expectations for this airline but was disappointed. I travel business class for long trips and this was the most uncomfortable plane I've ever experienced. The lie flat beds are ridiculously at an angle. You have to be some sort of a contortionist to be able to appreciate this service. Since this is a round trip, on the way back to Manila, the lounge in Singapore didn't offer much for their breakfast. The food trays didn't get refilled. After spending 30mins waiting, I had to go out of the lounge and just buy our breakfast from the fastfood area. Thought they were at one time the best airline. Will definitely have 2nd thoughts with this airline.","negative"

"459","No water This was probably one of worst experiences of a commercial airline. I heard and read such good reviews I was looking forward to flying with them. A 13 1/2 hour flight, a daytime flight, no sooner we had taken off, they wanted the window shutters down and dimmed the lights- remember that this was a daytime flight. They wanted everyone to sleep so they wouldn’t have to give any service. We asked for a bottle of water, none available just given half a plastic glass of water out of the tank. Food was awful and no snacks offered. We had to keep asking for water or juice to try to keep dehydrated. Only went to use the bathroom once……. Floor soaking wet, toilet not flushing fully and sink blocked (half full of water). Getting off the flight we both had bagging headaches and had to buy water to rehydrate. I have contacted Singapore airlines for them to comment but it’s been 11 days and nothing. Please avoid them as it is apparent that their service has been compromised","negative"

It was my first time flying with Singapore and I could not have asked for better. I struggle with motion sickness and had an issue halfway through the flight, one of the flight attendants went out of her way to make sure I was dealing with it okay and was all good. Legroom was fine. The meals were also fairly good, some of the better airline options I've had. The frozen strawberry yoghurt dessert was incredibly tasty. Can't fault Singapore Airlines. I'll definitely fly them again.","positive"
"4877","Five Star Economy When you've flown budget airlines, and then you step up and fly Singapore Airlines again, you really appreciate the comfort and quality of this airline. At boarding they ensured the group numbers were adhered to, so that people at the back were boarded first. None of that scrum that is usually experienced with budget airlines. It was lovely walking into a toilet that was cleaned frequently throughout the flight, toothbrushes in the bathroom, and staff that were so pleasant. The food was delicious and if you wanted alcohol that was free and available too. The crew work hard and are always smiling, even when they have some privileged economy customers that act like they are flying first class. Flying Singapore Airlines has reminded me of the beauty of premium airlines.","positive"
"1894","Best Airline in the World is simply FAKE NEWS! Yes, I am complaining about the business class service, its strictly a first world problem, I know, but when you pay for a premium service you expect exactly that. I have seen some customers act very rudely towards the staff from a sense of entitlement, and personally always make sure to treat the flight attendants, or in fact anyone I come across in my travels with absolute respect. Even if it is not reciprocated always, I feel good about myself, and invariably can get you through a border crossing without a full body search. I travel with Singapore Airlines a lot now as our travel has been restricted through Hong Kong since the riots in September. Perhaps this is simply a case of comparing apples with onions, as Cathay Pacific set such a high standard. To come back to the flight experience with Singapore Air, whilst the staff is initially very friendly, as soon as the first service is completed they are nowhere to be seen and service levels just dropped. I had to use the attendant button multiple occasions to request service and was done with a very clear lack of interest, they were NOT rude but it was not what you'd expect for premier air service. The seats are very uncomfortable and the design is simply grossly unergonomic, whilst the seats recline your legs are then pushed into a little shoebox where you cannot turn around or bend your legs. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS DESIGN!! The pods are large but as a consequence the seats only suitable for small people. MANY complaints online.... The and warm towels that are handed out from a disposable aluminum cooking tray smelled like the chicken satay skewers they served up afterward. Disgusting. If only I knew that the food was going to be worse on this flight, I would have held onto the towel to eat it, as it was not as tough as the meat I was served. They have a ""book the cook"" service, which is a great concept, but the delivery alas falls so far short on quality. Overall my experiences with Singapore Airlines have been similar since September, and suspect they simply leverage a good economic model that works on the basis of ""it's good enough"". I refuse to fly with Singapore airlines whenever I can practically avoid it. I think I will leave my disdain for their disgusting lounges in another deservedly scathing review, Singapore Airlines lounge is one of the saddest lounges around.","negative"
"1906","Business Class comfort - almost Singapore Airlines Business Class provides all the extras one would expect in the class. Fast check in and security operation, access to an excellent Lounge (at Heathrow T2), priority boarding, plenty of seat space, flat bed, excellent service from cabin crew, ample overhead locker space and quality food and drinks. The only slight drawback (just being a bit picky here) is that for taller people the flat bed design isn't perfect with legs at a slight angle and not much space for your feet. Also, there is insufficient space for stowing personal bits and pieces in the seat pod area. The seat pod design in Emirates business class, is still the best we have found.","positive"
"3799","Attentiveness The flight was general clean. Loaded with good entertainment. The couple sitting beside were vegetarian and they didnt request for special in advance. But the stewardess did her best to serve them vegetarian food. I had an bad encounter。A stewardess looked pissed when i didnt hear her calling me. She gave me an irritated look.","positive"
"854","Worst Airline Ever The flight itself was adequate, the food was mediocre at best, the service was appalling. Staff totally uninterested in assisting staff. The did it begrudgingly at best. Worse than that was the after service. I left something on the plane and wanted to see if it had been found. I know exactly where it was. I couldn't contact SA by phone because the number on their website is incorrect. I used their online form, sent emails and tweets, even Facebook, but no response whatsoever. I consider this extremely rude and very unprofessional. Absolutely appalling customer service. Circumstances meant I had to change my booking for a return flight. I've done this with other airlines without any issue whatsoever. SA had to prove their ineptitude yet again. They went out of their way to do it. I eventually had to call Australia to get things organised properly. I have complained and asked for an apology, but as per their arrogant customer service policy, they've just ignored me. I had flown SA before, and they were good. I expected so much better. I will not be using their services again in a hurry. I recommend everyone look elsewhere.","negative"

"10684","Departing SIN-LHR on the redeye flight (departing 1 am), this means a group of grumpy and tired travellers. Took the front row bulkhead seat in PE on Boeing 777-300ER which gives quite a lot of legroom, the downside is the the inflight entertainment (IFE) system is tucked away on the floor, in a it's own separate housing. I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can. Overall, a good experience especially now that PE pricing appears to be equivalent to the prices from competitors such as Lufthansa.","positive"

"568","Abandoned in a foreign country My flight was cancelled at the airport but the cancellation didn't show up on singapore airs computer system so they didn't believe me and would not rebook me even though my travelling partner was rebooked within an hour. They wouldn't do anything and left me abandoned in a foreign city 30 hours from home with no way to travel. I had to find and pay $2500 for a flight on another airline and travel 6 hours by train to another city to catch it. 8 months on singapore still will not refund me or call to discuss, only standard email responses that aren't relevant to the matter. will never fly with them again","negative"
"5740","not top! It was certainly good but not the top! what you hear everywhere and all the time about Singapore Air. With Singapore Airlines it is good marketing! Nevertheless... it was a good experience. The cabin looks nice and elegant with nice colors and nothing cheap! The seat, the space: the seat is wide and really very comfortable. There is enough space for personal belongings. For sleeping a seat cover will be put over the entire seat for more comfort and it really feels very good. What I still do not like is the little cubby hole for the feet when stretching out and that I have to lay not straight on the seat but at an angle. The service during dinner was slow and unattentive. Even that Business Class was half empty I was surprised that the crew was busy but not busy with customers. The food was a total disappointment and disaster. They had many food options on board but then I had lost appetite. The beverage service inbetween was practically absent: no one to be seen. The wines were okay. I was irritated that they advertised a French wine on the wine list but didn't have it on board. So why mention it??? That would not happen on Qatar AIrways! It was a good experience but with significant flaws! Singapore Airlines is certainly better than BA and AA but they can't reach Qatar Airways... according to my experiences.","positive"
"1417","Really disappointed! Messed us around a lot My partner and I had payed $3000 all up for our flights back to New Zealand from Ho Chi Min and we were extremely disappointed with the service we got. They sent us an email to let us know that they have cancelled our original flight at 12:15pm and had rescheduled us onto a flight at 7:50pm and that our flight from Singapore to Christchurch would be the following day now at 7:50pm and that they would provide us with accommodation. We were very understanding although it meant a change in our schedule and our connecting flights from Christchurch to Nelson would be effected as well, we thanked them for organising us the accommodation and that we understood that it was a busy time for them, I asked where we would be staying and they emailed back saying they will give us the details at the counter When we are at the airport. When we arrived in Singapore we went to the counter (11pm) to ask them where the accommodation was that we were staying in only to be told that there are no more rooms available and that they can’t give us a bed although they promised they would, they offered us a food voucher instead of accommodation which we would have preferred a bed over food but took the food voucher because we couldn’t get a bed. It wasn’t just us that had been told they had a room reserved for them it was everyone on that same flight going through to Christchurch and other flights to so there were no couches left to sleep on in the airport and all of our bags had gone straight through to Christchurch so we have no warm clothes or blankets and then when we tried to get dinner with the food voucher we got told that they aren’t accepting the vouchers any more.","negative"
"3335","Fabulous airline We undertook our first long haul flight in August (to Australia) and then back to England in September. We booked with Singapore Air as they were highly recommended and we weren't disappointed. The flight from Heathrow to Singapore was right on time and as soon as we boarded we were welcomed and made comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew. The food was hot and tasty - drinks were offered and the wine and beer were lovely. Not only was it our first long haul flight but we had to change planes for the first time as well - I was a bit anxious about this but it couldn't have been easier. Well signposted with staff at hand to help and advise. We would love to fly with Singapore Air again and would highly recommend them","positive"

"7056","Best sleep on a aircraft I’ve had Great airline, excellent service and the best sleep I’ve had on a aircraft, this must be because the noise of the aircraft is so quiet.

"10691","Singapore to Newark. Cabin crew attitude, IFE & food were amazing. The only problem that I had with them was my Mileage Plus, both the cabin crew on the outbound flight and the ground staff in Newark barely knew anything about it. I asked the outbound flight crew about my Mileage Plus, they told me to consult the ground crew who just said both airlines are members of Star Alliance. He wasn't even sure if Mileage Plus members flying on Singapore Airlines were able to access United lounges. However he did tell me that Mileage Plus users (me inclusive) had to upgrade to Gold before accessing a Kris Flyer lounge but that seemed to be the only thing he knew about Mileage Plus.","positive"

Showed it to delivery guy who said I should report to SQ which I did. Reply from SQ was that they are not responsible as this is considered ""wear and tear"". I don't understand what has this got to do with ""wear n tear"" when lock is missing with broken zipper and suitcase was bent?? Lucky for me, even with broken zipper nothing was missing. Didn't know SQ is so irresponsible to give me such a reply. Very disappointed as this is not my 1st travel with SQ. I've given good reviews before both business class n premium economy. In fact, was a crew member with SQ back in the 80s n is very proud of this airlines until now!!","positive"
"5633","Attitude and Service at its worst Terrible experience on flight 423 on 4/26, from booking, check-in, boarding and in-flight. Booking: All seats on Premium economy, Business and First Class were completely blocked out when online booking was made. Only economy class was available for the above sector. Unbelievable. Check-in: I had asked the ground staff if I could do an upgrade (using my miles, not free upgrade, just to be clear) so that I could get some rest on this red-eye flight due to sore back and stomach discomfort. Ground crew Indian guy informed that flight was completely full and no seats in Premium econ, Business Class or Suites were available. Checked in for the econ class as booked. Boarding: Went to the line for Business class but was turned away by the ground staff, Indian lady. Pointed to the board which indicated Business Class and PPS Club. Oblivious about it, the unbelieveable staff insisted that I go queue in the Krisflyer line together with the rest of the Econ class passengers, despite my ticket showing Group 2 boarding. When finally got to the desk where staff checked boarding pass, I had immediately feedback to the staff to ask if PPS/Group 2 boarding was no longer in practice but to my surprise, she had said I should be using the lane for quick boarding!! Is this now a total disregard for PPS member flying on econ class?? Not to mention the demeaning treatment and embarrassment caused??!!!! In-flight: Was greeted by crew on-board, Matthew. Commented about not being able to book a seat on PE/B/F class and a busy night for the crew for a completely full flight. Feeling discomfort with the seat, I sounded out to him that I was disappointed that there weren't any available seats in Premium, Business or Suites for me to do an upgrade. Was shocked to learn from him while Premium and Business class were full, there were still available seats in Suites. He had then helped to approach the ground staff to check if an upgrade could be done. Ground staff came back to say that they weren't able to upgrade despite seats were still available. (Again, not asking for free upgrade but using my own miles.) Reason given sounded ridiculous, something like the system was closed and nothing could be done. Inflight supervisor came by to say the same. Utterly disappointed that a simple gesture of goodwill for a 6-year PPS member could not even be done, in spite of the discomfort of an unwell passenger. I seriously wonder if this is what and how the airline treats a long time customer these days, not to mention the support and cost in flying premium most of the time. If there isn’t any premium recognition for the premium customers, there serves no point and reason for continuing patronage with the disappointment and letdown caused. And it’s ironic that I had previously given a full rating on TA that contributed to SIA being awarded the world’s best airline by this very same website. Slap!","negative"
"1514","With this airline - READ THE T's & C's!!!! Having read the reviews we were excited to say the least! My wife is disabled and I wanted a direct flight to Singapore where we were going to get on a cruise. I booked the flight independently as we wanted to see Singapore over 2 days and not have to rush directly to the ship! Unfortunately 3 days before the flight NCL cancelled the cruise due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Probably a good thing as my wife is over 80 years old (this was to be her 'bucket list' holiday.) I assumed we might get some kind of refund but when I rang the airline they told me that they would not refund a penny - BUT I now owed them $200 cancellation fee!!! I was shocked to say the least as when we read that bit in the Terms and Conditions we thought that it meant we'd get $200 on top of a full refund if they cancelled the flight. So we've lost the full £1,200 cost of the one-way flight plus the cancellation or no-show cost. To add to our misery this was not claimable from Stay Sure Travel Insurance which had cost the two of us £1200 for the year!!!","negative"
"698","What happened to our National carrier?? We had to wait 1.5 hours to check in our luggages at Istanbul! After having a great meal at Turkish Airline’s lounge, we cannot helped but to compare how sad our own Krisflyer lounge at Changi has become! Food and cleanliness were just missing! Hardly any top up and food was pretty tasteless compared to Turkish airline’s lounge where fresh breads and cook to order live stations were well manned! We tried several times to ‘book the cook’ and were not given that option. On board the leading and more senior stewardess ( in green and purple) gave great service as usual, however, the junior stewardess in blue kebaya was just rushing and practically panicking up and down the aisle! For a moment I thought I was on Air France again! There was no grace and the nice touches of serving us on bended knees have all disappeared! Bread had to be requested even after mains were served. Tea had to be requested too when desserts were provided. What happened to the satay too?! The route from Singapore to Istanbul had none. At least the Istanbul to Sin had some!! And the worst part was, when we landed at Changi airport, we discovered her luggage wheel went missing! Her Samsonite was damaged! After making the report, Changi has stated they will repair the luggage not replace it!!! So why did we have priority tags on luggage if the bags were going to be so badly mishandled?! We really would like a replacement Samsonite And seriously, pls do review standards. It is not expensive to provide bed slippers automatically especially the route from Singapore ! Why are there double standards? The Singapore to Istanbul crew stated slippers and eye mask were now upon request only, while the Istanbul back to Singapore had all the usual amenites at the seat? We used to be so proud and happy to fly our national carrier. Now we are seriously thinking its better to go on Qatar Q suites. At least we get pyjamas too and dont need to request for cheap slipper on board","negative"
"7553","Fabulous flight Everything was perfect: the service, the food (we got to choose our meal ahead of time), the subtle Christmas decorations. It was an airbus 380 and we were on the upper deck with very comfortable seats and LCD screens. Just perfect for a long day flight.","positive"

"9573","Disappointing Customer Service after cancellation of connection I booked a flight in January 2018 for a trip in June 2018 through the Singapore Airlines website from SJC to NRT through LAX. They booked us on an Alaska Airlines flight to get us from SJC to LAX. The day before our trip, AA cancelled their flight and Singapore did not even notify us of the cancellation. Fortunately, we were notified by our tripit app that the flight had been cancelled so we called Singapore and they basically said, oops, sorry, then they rebooked us on a Delta flight from SJC to LAX. When we got to the airport in the morning, the Delta flight was completely booked so I'm not sure how we would have gotten to LAX if we hadn't been notified by tripit. We had multiple delays for our SJC to LAX flight on Delta and ended up missing our connection for our LAX to NRT flight on SA. Even though SA booked our flight on Delta, they had no idea that we were delayed and actually called me to see if we were going to make the flight. While we were sitting and waiting in SJC, I called SA to figure out our options since I knew we would miss the connection. Their solutions were to book us on a magic flight that took us from LAX to Boise (I think) and then back to San Francisco and we would get there at the same time as the flight leaving LAX. The other option was for us to fly from LAX to Singapore and then to NRT. At least with this route they conceded that it would kill a day for us. Their final solution and what they actually ended up doing for us was to wash their hands of us and say that Delta was the one that had the delay and that it is their fault and we need to deal with them to get us to NRT. Singapore ended up completely passing the buck even though they were the ones that booked our flight. It wasn't like we booked our own SJC to LAX flight that was delayed. Singapore booked us and then washed their hands of us once the flight they booked us on was delayed.","negative"
"4202","Easily the best in the Airline industry I can't think of any other brand in the industry that works so consistently to be number one in a lot of areas. From their service, the type of products (premium economy being my favorite) the courtesy of the staff and their entire motto/ value system they follow is remarkable. I always believe, that for a company to be so successful and consistent, it generally starts from management and trickles down. SQ is a perfect example. Great vision and it shows. How i wish they flew from abu dhabi as well.","positive"
"5563","17 1/2 hour flight I had wanted to fly the Airbus A350-9000 aircraft since I became aware of it. There are two classes. Business Class and Premium Economy. I got a good airfare where it was BC going out and Premium Economy for the return. This review is the outbound in business class. The inbound is a few weeks away. The good: Boarding. Cabin Service. Food (great). I used the Book the Cook service prior to the flight Large Entertainment screen The NOT SO Good: The seat. Yes the seat. It was a lie flat seat but one had to angle one's legs into the left corner instead of straight on. To get into the lie flat position one had to get up and pull the seat back down. Make up the seat, etc. The reverse when going back to a sitting position. The entertainment selection was not by using a touch active screen but a overly sensitive controller. Would I fly it again? Doubtful.","neutral"
"780","Return flight from Hell! We purchased return BC fares on SAL in March this year. 3 days prior to our return flight to Melbourne scheduled for Oct 2nd, I noticed my wife’s return booking reference had disappeared from my SAL app. I rang SAL at that point to be advised that this ticket had been redeemed/cancelled. Big surprise and consternation at this news as neither we nor our travel consultant had requested/received this flight refund/cancellation. Wife in tears for the next few days thinking she’d be stranded overseas or needing to pay a fortune for reaccessing her BC tickets home. Agreed to pay an extra $1708 to SAL @ Schiphol to obtain a BC seat for my wife. Travel agent paid $1400 for economy class ticket for my wife’s Sing to Melbourne trip home. Worst travelling experience we’ve ever had in 40 years. Never flying SAL again and will be “evangelical “in the future describing the appalling lack of Customer Service or care/interest SAL showed for our predicament - apart from the 2 SAL stars at Schiphol (Peggy and Stephen), who did what they could in the circumstances. 0/10 to SAL for this appalling experience!","negative"

This was a night flight leaving at 2 am in morning. Cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. They made me a cup of tea in the middle of the night. We had frequent offers of water or juice or on request alcohol. The dinner was ok with free wine and a G&T. Breakfast of scrambled egg and chicken sausage (chicken sausage not very nice). The plane was comfortable and one advantage was a foot rest in economy. We did not have that luxury on an A380 super jumbo. Film choice fine.

We were unable to recover the bag since they moved the aircraft to a parking area. We departed on our flight to San Francisco before we found the bag. The bag was found later and turned into the Changi Airport lost and found. Singapore Airlines notified us of the status of the bag. After Contacting Changi lost and found, we confirmed the contents of the bag and they apologized for discarding the pistachio nuts. Once we contacted Singapore Airlines at San Francisco airport the personnel notified Singapore Airlines in Singapore and they obtained the bag, after we authorized it’s release from the lost and found, and placed the bag on the next flight to San Francisco. I sent Singapore Airlines San Francisco a FedEx label and the bag was delivered two days later. We received the bag which had a nylon tie on the zipper and everything was in place.

My feeder flight was delayed on my way to PVG so I missed my PVG-SIN flight. The SIA staff in PVG changed my ticket without any question or fee. The inflight entertainment on FRA-SIN leg was not functioning properly. When disembarking in SIN the airline staff gave every passenger a gift of leather wallet as compensation and apologized personally to everyone. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines. They deserve to be a 5 star airline. I will definitely fly SIA again. If there was one thing bad is that I didn't really like their check-in staff in JFK.","positive"

"205","Bad experience I will give no star for Singapore airlines if you TripAdvisor has no star for rating. Because I had a terrible experience from Singapore Airlines at DPS (Bali). They have no rule for getting the line. I pay extra for my ticket because I don’t want to wait and getting lines with economy tickets, BUT the coworkers of Singapore airlines at DPS airport don’t care about what I pay extra for. Thus, they let economy passengers who has child go to the airplane before me, doesn’t matter I getting the lines at business lines before them. Firstly, I don’t know why economy passengers who has children can go before me event I pay extra for business tickets. The economy passengers has only 1 child, but they go with 10 adult from 30 to 50 years old. OMG child looks a like an express ticket, that has more powerful than business and first class tickets. Secondly, if you guys rule can let them go with business lines, so they need to getting the line right? The rude things from Singapore airlines coworkers is they let those rude people skip the line and go before business and first class lines. That is so mean and rude service. Third, in the airplane one of passenger has coughed like 30 minutes, that he couldn’t stop. The cabin crew didn’t come to ask him or help him at all. They should tell him goes to the bathroom or give him hot water or at least try to help him, but they didn’t do that. Finally, I will give Singapore Airlines one star for rating. I will not recommend to go with this company. Their service very terrible. If you guy don’t believe me, you can try and will see what happens at DPS Bali airport. Good luck!","negative"
"8408","A long flight bit the Airline was good Checked in on line bit unable to change seats that was allocated to us as there was a Cauldron system . Ground agent's very good got there early but could not change seats.The flight was full,maybe that was the reason no change of seat. The A350 to Singapore very Quite in flight and what with the lighting seating and the air,I did not feel as tired. The food was ok but had better food on airlines. But way made the difference was there was a nice hot damp towel,and with all the two flights properly metal cutlery. Also through out the 12 hour flight there was good entertainment on the screen. Along with snacks and a few of the flight attendants going up and down with water and Orange juice. Yet again different to other airlines that don't do that if you want a drink or a Snack you have to press the call button and all the Cree are in a huddle On the second flight much smaller plane and ran by Silk Air but once again flight 3.5 hrs The flight attendants were helpful and friendly that flight again left on time and arrived on time. Well done Singapore/ Silk Air carry on with the good service.","positive"
"4000","Long Flight but Sign up for Mobile Passport The flight time is 18.5 hours so be prepared for one long non stop service flight. Service is always very good on SQ but use the time wisely to get yourself adjusted to the local time zone through sleeping time, meals and time to catch in some movies. Upon arrival at Newark at 6am, be prepared to face long queues at US immigration. As of beginning in 2019, arrivals should apply for mobile passport to avoid long queues....not only for visitors but also US passports (those without Global Entry Access). Mobile Passport is easy to setup on line but one can get a free trial to start the App but there will be a charge $19.99 for a year's fee. However, at 6am, the queues are long for all lines so it doesn't really prove that Mobile passport is any faster. Anyway, it will take around 45 mins to clear immigration; which is still way too long compared to other countries.","positive"

"8730","The standard seems to have slipped in recent years We flew with Singapore Airline a few years and and considered it to be the best carrier we had ever experienced. Everything was impeccable. However, this time, the standard had somehow slipped. The services were still excellent but the seats were cramped. The meal was meagre - only coffee and tea plus a main dish. No entree or sweets or anything. I am a small eater and even I found this to be inadequate (but for some reason, on our return flight from Singapore later on, the menu was much better, The food quality and quantity improved significantly). The cabin was very clean and so were the toilets which also provided other basic amenities such as tooth brushes and combs. Boarding was not too easy as they changed the gate number one hour before boarding. Lucky we arrived early and so had plenty of time to find the new gate and the departure hall was quite large.","positive"

The seats are comfortable but rather tight for anyone over six foot tall, there was not much choice in the movies presented and the food well......chicken rice and later a pulled pork roll just don’t cut it. The service from the staff was impeccable as usual and I even was given a second bread roll when I asked. I can see it is a part of a cutback that most airlines are doing now to lower airfares but maybe if Singapore took another $20 out of business class fares they could maybe give flyers a better food choice.","neutral"
"52","Stay far away from SIA Terrible terrible airline. I boycotted them for years, but thought I’d give them a shot again. Nope, bad choice. I had to change one way of my return trip. Sent in an enquiry for change before my flight, which is the only way you can get in contact with a human. Without informing me first, they cancelled my return flight, and sold off my reservation to someone else. Then proceeded to tell me to rebook my original booking for an additional 2k USD, with the excuse being a flexi ticket instead of a lite ticket. Unethical and money grabbing. Please note, if you had the misfortune of booking with them before reading my review, that they do not hold tickets that they quote you in an email. They will proceed to tell you that the tickets they quoted you in the morning has been sold, so your only option is to pay more money, than what you’ve already paid for a business class ticket, to beg them to give you an economy ticket. Please, for the sake of your sanity, stay away from this airline. Pretty much any airline out there is a better option.","negative"
"8244","Still one of the best Our first flight on an A350 and the seating was excellent, both the ‘normal’ seating and the lay flat bed. The plane was almost brand new so everything on board was immaculate. The check in ar Düsseldorf was seamless and the checkin staff were efficent and extremely pleasant. As always the service on board was all one could ask for and again, as previously the food was excellent with a good wine selection. Singapore never fail to impress and they are definitely up there as one of the leading aitrlines if not the best.","positive"
"5171","I just don’t get it. What am I missing? World’s best airline? Not by a very long shot!! I quit flying SQ’s economy products years ago while living in Singapore. It was so often terrible, notably dirty. Most recently I ventured back into their business class to discover their new fit out. I honestly didn’t think I could dislike a plane seat more than their old fold down leather seats which became lumpy and rancid smelling, but alas, at least you had space to stretch while the seat was in its bed configuration. The new seat is a regular slide down seat BUT it’s extremely hard and excruciatingly uncomfortable to sleep on. It’s like laying on a wood floor with less than an inch of fabric to provide comfort. Bring back the smelly old leather seats I say! Although on my return flight I got that old fit out on an A380 and it was still stinking like the back of on old man’s car. A note on cabin crew: I find the so-called SQ girls (and boys) to be extremely insincere and unhelpful. Even in business class, they are slow to respond and barely articulate. The fake and uncomfortable grimacing is upsetting. The Singapore girl on my aisle was trying hurry me into menu choices I didn’t want because she visibly couldn’t be bothered. Worse still, she couldn’t pronounce any of the words correctly, which was ridiculous. Not a matter of accent, but a complete lack of interest. Generally speaking, Singapore Airlines is just so tacky. From the ugly old uniforms to the lounges, to the inflight music and the menus, which look like they were typeset in the 1980s using your neighbour’s word processor. Just awful.","negative"
"9647","Comfort and Great Customer Service keeps me faithful to Singapore Airlines I have flown SQ whenever possible, to China, South Korea, India, Indonesia , but never have I experience such good service in economy class then on this route I flew Singapore to Johannesburg and return by Cape Town. On the way in i had a rash on my arm and requested the stewardess for some cream to relief the itch. She not only came with the anti-septic cream but also offered to apply it for me. Thanks to her I had a good flight. She checked up on me 2-3 time afterwards and eventually offered me to take the tube of cream on my trip. Its these little gestures which make me go back to flying SQ time and time again Service aside, SQ lies 350 3-3-3 configuration. The leg room was extremely generous. I am 1.68 and could stretch out comfortably without touching the back of the seat in front. Airflow and air pressure was excellent","positive"
"10558","Perth to Singapore. My seat was a single seat by the window. The seat fully reclines and a little enclave under the monitor allows legs to be fully stretched out (for short people like me). Overall, a comfortable flight with good entertainment and plenty of food. I was even able to get Umeshu on the flight. Service is excellent and the complimentary WiFi service tied me through 5 hours on WhatsApp.","positive"
"2122","Disappointing Although this airline gets the best airline in the world the last 3 times we have flown buisness class out of Australia to Europe and Singapore have been disappointing. The staff are mostly quite good with an occasional expection. The food was very average and very disappointing. The flavour and the quality was ordinary. The fish was watery and bland. Sweets were unamaginative. Fruit presented in a basket for other passengers as well and you were asked to take what you wanted with your hand!!!!! The bread rolles were ordinary and they preferred you had the garlic bread which looked awful. Cheese was presented without crackers. Quality of choclate poor on one flight. It felt like the cabin crew wanted to keep the bread and chocolates and cheese for themselves to eat or to save momey. On one flight no combs, toothbushes or decent toiletrees in the toilet. All in all not good enough and disappointing. Will try other airlines next time.","neutral"
"6868","Disappointed Had not flown SQ since the days their ""BigTop"" used to land at CYYZ. Their new Ultra Long Range 350, while technically impressive, had sub-par seats/lie flat beds; passable catering and a cabin crew member with attitude! In fairness, my interaction with other members of the cabin crew were most cordial. A poorly designed seat and tasteless meals detracted from an enjoyable flying experience. Not looking forward to our return flight - to EWR.","neutral"
"292","Why can't Singapore Airlines act in good faith when altering bookings. ""Complimentary / No penalty"" should mean that. We booked return business class flights to Europe on flexible tickets. It was then necessary for us to change the Sydney Paris leg to Sydney Istanbul on a later date. The ticket conditions stated ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" . We expected this fare difference condition to be applied in good faith. Singapore Airlines imposed a 30% penalty for this change. I questioned the Singapore Airlines staff on this 30% penalty in two regards Firstly, we were changing to a shorter, cheaper flight, why was the cost increasing? * Flight Time for Singapore Paris is 13h 35m. Flight Time for Singapore Istanbul is 11h 0m * The fare for Sydney Paris is AUD7792.39-8217.25 The fare for Sydney Istanbul is AUD 6342.59 at the time we proposed the change to the booking. Secondly, part of this change is that an airfare Singapore Paris on 26 Aug is now made available for sale by Singapore. The price of this fare is higher than the Istanbul fare which would be taken off the market by our change. So as well as charging an extra 30% for the outward bound leg of our journey, Singapore profit further by the higher sale price of that Paris fare. Singapore may well say that they might not sell this fare. Perhaps, but they also may not sell the Istanbul fare. Despite interactions with many many Singapore Airlines staff, not one person ever answered the issues raised, or in any way ""owned the problem"" To make matters worse the Singapore Airlines representative proudly told me there was ""no penalty"" for the change in booking. In such case why the 30% charge for changing to a cheaper flight ? So while I understand “revenue maximisation models” I also understand concepts of acting in good faith with customers. How does this latter concept factor in their penalty ? Singapore Airlines talks with pride about the experience it provides to people who fly with them. The process we are going through now is part of that experience. All we were looking for is that people act in good faith and with fairness. These practices should really be reviewed by Australia's consumer protection authorities. The statement ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" is clearly grossly misleading. That should be our next step.","negative"
"8223","Continually fantastic service From the moment you sit to the time you step off the plane the staff are always helpful and polite. The wet towel to refresh, the pillow and blanket, the snacks given out straight away.....all these little extras make for a comfortable flight. I always found my seat comfortable and roomy, and clean with no rubbish in pockets. Toilets are clean. Food is always nice. The stopover in Singapore was easy and overall Singapore airlines is by far my airline of choice. A pleasure to fly with them.","positive"
"8392","Very Uncomfortable Biz Seat Quite how the new seat design was approved is a quirk of nature. And to install it on the longest flight in the works is some kind of cruel joke. In unreclined mode you are sat bolt upright with nowhere to rest your legs, unless you have the flexibility of a gymnast and can squeeze them into the small space diagonally opposite you. Some points awarded if you can get one of your legs in the hole! Then when you want to sleep, rather than press a button and recline you have to stand up and wrestle the bed which is heavy and cumbersome to get it to fold down (watch all the other irritated passengers doing the same) and then lie down at an angle to try desperately to tuck your feet into the diagonal hole. Incredibly uncomfortable and best suited for those auditioning for Houdini roles or small kids who I imagine don’t travel Biz too often. I am 6,1 and 180 lbs. You will wake up in some strange contortion with new aches in your body. Awesome. Food is excellent, entertainment excellent and cabin noise low. But even the service level has dropped as you are automatically woken for food, all lights and music go on and it feels like a production line versus the old SQ EWR SIN nonstop which was bespoke and tailored to comfort. A sentence that could never be uttered for many years, but the AA biz seat is the Tesla of seats compared to SQ’s Reliant Robin clunker.","negative"

The customer care is back to being second to none and the food and entertainment packages were also first class. We were lucky in that the return flight was not full and so my wife and I had three seats each, this enabling us to get flat and sleep properly. I would most certainly rate this airline in the top few of long haul carriers and we really enjoyed each leg of what is a long journey. Many thanks to Singapore Airlines!!","positive"
"7525","So disappointed I was happy to travel with SQ as it was one of the top airline. The advertisement shows always business or first. But for this trip I traveled in economy. I was surprised by the old plane A330. The Seat was uncomfortable and no space for legs. I am not a tall guy!! Impossible to touch the small meal. The only good thing is the air hostess with great smile. But a smile is not enough to satisfy a passenger. Next trip I will go Bangkok. Let see how will be SQ","negative"
"11283","LHR-SIN economy 12 May 15. Airplane was very comfortable with flat seats extremely comfortable to lay down (as it was half empty most of people had a row of seats for himself). Inflight entertainment had a large variety of movies of any genre. Food was good and generally abundant. The only two drawbacks were the delay it had departing from Heathrow (more than 1 hour) and the possibility to have dinner with reclined seats meaning that I had little space for my dinner as the child in front of me decided to do so. I would still classify a 5 star experience.","positive"

The food was only just warm (health risk?) and the staff were not very visible, they seemed really keen for everyone to sleep, although it was a morning flight. There was a distinct lack of drinks and no alcoholic drinks were offered at all. This said the flight was boarded on time and arrived on time.","neutral"

SQ advises that all their SQ flights with B777-300ER and A350/380 has wi-fi. Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry. I can understand that most of the passengers are doing a transit but there are many of us who are just starting our day and with a flight at 0700 there is not much time for breakfast. I would appreciate if SQ indicate clearly which flights have wifi and not a blanket statement about the aircraft.","neutral"

Although we were only flying Economy class, the service was certainly first class, we had all the creature comforts an airline can offer. The staff treated us like family, very helpful & concerned for our comfort. The food was sensational (for airline food) so much so we were waiting for our next meal.

Plane from Tokyo landed in Batam, Indonesia instead, flew back to Singapore in three hours. Same issue happened once due to technical problem, but apparently SIA always tries their best not to compensate me with business class seats, even though I missed my flight because of their problems and I have been their gold member for 4 years now. I was compensated only with another economy class seat and SGD 15 meal voucher that I can only redeem at limited number of food outlets at Changi airport, and most of them are too random (food not looking good at all). They have been also been doing this cost cutting in the economy class meals by not giving appetizers anymore. FAs never happy when I order some special drinks even though they are on the menu. If SIA wants to do some cost cutting or what not, they should have made it less obvious, especially to loyal customers, otherwise loyal customers will look for other cost-effective Star Alliance carriers. Their ticket price for the same route is a lot more expensive compared to some other Star Alliance such as ANA and Asiana Airlines.","neutral"

The personal monitor is larger, champagne is offered, better food, Haagen Daz ice cream was served for dessert. The icing on the cake has to be their service.

"623","Singapore airlines has lost its edge. Undertook four long-haul flights with Singapore airlines in November/December 2022. The flight from London to Singapore was excellent. Attentive and courteous flight attendants plus good service. Just what one would normally expect from Singapore airlines. the next three flights were average to bad. Boarding in Changi airport was a complete scrum. No clear differentiation of lines for business class and economy. The return flight from Singapore to London was totally lacklustre. Although business class was approximately one third empty the staff were lethargic at best. The only drinks offered during this 13.5 hour flight were at the two meal services. Over the past 30 years I have travelled extensively in both business class and economy. I can mostly say that the level of service is far better in Thai air economy class. Come on Singapore airlines, don't rest on your laurels in this highly competitive market.","neutral"

This time we could not do that, even though we tried as soon as bookings opened, so the concierge at the hotel rang them and asked for us. He was told they could not help us because we had booked through a travel agent, the plane was full and no change was available.

I didn’t know how to discreetly report it to cabin crew and quite frankly just wanted to get off the plane. When I landed I was in tears. My friends encouraged me to write an incident report and send it to the airline. The airline were shockingly unsympathetic and unhelpful. They told me it was a police matter and nothing to do with them. They were cold and unsympathetic. They told me all the things they could have done had i reported it on board. There was no sympathy or understanding of how difficult my experience was. I was also provided with incorrect information about how to report the incident to the police which worryingly indicates to me the airline has not got a grip on the issue. I can’t find the words to express my disappointment adequately. Passenger safety extends beyond showing people where life jackets and emergency exits are.

I didn’t want a free flight or anything, I just want to cancel the upgrade. Will never fly SA again, the onboard service is always the best, but let down my politics and office staff. To just quote T&Cs all the time and take the stance they have, is some big company bully. T&Cs that clearly protect them but not the customer.

After reading several similar reviews on tripadvisor, I have just reported them to the Department of Transportation. Their website lacks functionality to rebook or cancel flights. Live chats with customer service state there are no representatives available. I have tried submitting an online form 3 times with an automated response received but no follow up to resolve my issue within the time frame they promised. I have waited on hold for over an hour with their Los Angele office only to be disconnected at 1:20. I have tried calling their office in the country I am visiting several times and I waited for over 30 minutes without success. I understand that with the pandemic, airline response times will be slower, but I began this process 18 days before my flight and still no success. I have never reported any business before, but this is the peak of negligence - either that or fraud. Even if this eventually does get resolved, which I am beginning to doubt, it has been a miserable, frustrating experience. I have resigned myself to lose a lot of money.

"9909","Cut short holiday Had to cut short our holiday in Australia for sudden bereavement , and other reasons in family. the airline would not transfer our tickets to a departure 2 weeks earlier , we had to cancel our flights first before we could rebook , and then pay for 2 seats as well , as it was we had to get home so we paid .Staff in Flightcenter Manly were very helpful and did all they could for us ,many thanks to them , but disappointed with airline , probably will not fly with them again .","neutral"

"1001","Trying to cancel a flight and get a refund This review is not about a flight experience but the awful experience we had with Singapore Airlines trying to connect with a live agent and to get someone to address the cancel and refund process that we wanted done within 24 hours of our booking. Their webpage has numbers that don't exist, call centers are staffed by rude, unprofessional people that hang up on you after giving you another number that doesn't exist. We spent 6 hours trying to sort the simple issue out. We finally found a number after an extensive online search and by just randomly hitting numbers on the number pad when it went into auto mode, we connected with an individual. Mercifully, Joni was the exception and she handled the refund issue in 15 minutes. We just lost a half day trying to sort something that was a mere 15 minutes ..if that and to get an email stating that our refund would be made available in 4-6 business weeks. It doesn't take that long for SA to collect monies from us but, boy, the completely asinine process in place to amend an issue is unbelievable for an institution that has been in place for as many years as SA has been.","negative"

"6903","#1 for a reason Singapore airline is rated the number 1 airline in the world and it shows. The staff on board are the most accommodating and professional I have ever saw. The airport is immaculate and the plane is just the same. Everyone gets a pillow and blanket. There are TVs located behind every seat with enough movies and shows to keep you busy during such a long flight. The in flight food is pretty good also. They feed you what seems like every 4 hours lol you also get free alcohol and snacks whenever you want. The flight was smooth to Germany then to Singapore everything went well no hold ups or delays. The flight staff were well dressed and polite to everyone on board. I can’t recommend this airline enough when traveling abroad. Like I said they are #1 for a reason and it really shows. I’d pick Singapore airline everywhere I go and I wish airlines in the United States would model themselves after them as they are the pinnacle of flying right now.","positive"
"9061","The entertainment! Got a 2 to go tickets otherwise this carrier is out of my budget. The flight to London is a Beoing 777, nice seats and bright toilets. Coming back, it was a A380 but I didn't like the toilet because they are dark and cramped. Food is awful. The breakfast chicken noodle was mushy it became one 'united' noodle that was disgusting to eat. Missed the nuts; the cracker pack has green peas that can break my teeth. The plane stinks and was nauseating when they get ready for meals. They provide water periodically. I watched almost 24 hours of TV/movies both ways; what a great way to fly. More Korean movies would be much appreciated. Checked in with mobile app and the passport scan is pesky and inaccurate data capture. But it is convenient because trips are all consolidated in the app.","positive"
"2922","First SG Dreamliner Flight Left early and arrived early! I like 787's and this was a good one - the seats were snug compared to the 380 but that's how Boeing did it - changed the original 2-4-2 configuration to a more cramped 3-3-3. Better video system than the SG 380. My lamb curry was exceptional!","positive"
"7021","Long flight made pleasant We have flown different airlines in the past but Singapore airlines has been one of the best - for space and service mostly. We didnt find the in house films particularly exciting although there was a huge selection in various languages - could be they just werent to our personal taste. The food was reasonable although it beats me how all the airlines seem to offer quite a lot of stodgey food. The fresh fruit salad was wonderful. Flying via Singapore with a long connection time we took advantage of free bus tour around city; Got a few hours quality sleep in a transit hotel in the airport. Tips given staff at Singapore Airways which we enjoyed.","positive"
"1481","Can Not Believe it’s Singapore Airlines My family had been using Singapore Airlines for five decades and IT WAS my favorite until my last one five weeks ago. The first flight from SGN was better but the long one to the states was so bad. The seat was not comfortable comparing with other airlines as premium economy, the food was not good but Hägen-Dazs ice cream that I like and the most upset me was the lady flight attendants being so rude even our cabin was about half full, maybe due to this time when passengers were wearing masks to keep themselves safe during the flight. It was too costly for us to purchase one way tickets to fly with Singapore Airlines I used to think it was the best for traveling in Asia. Full of disappointments for this trip when we’ve almost got charge for almost another 8 hundred dollars so we had to fly a day later for almost 2 hundred instead for the date change after we got the tickets","negative"
"11325","Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.","positive"
"7819","Business Class Night Flight Changi Singapore to London. Perhaps the best night flight one can experience. Almost surreal with wraith like hostesses in traditional sarongs so professional and attentive. The seat / bed virtually goes back to horizontal and although secured by a seat belt, you can lie comfortably on your side. High quality food and drink. I normally start off with champagne, have dinner with red wine, then finish off with a brandy. This suffices to ensure a good eight hours sleep, waking up in time for breakfast refreshed, prior to landing in London. You pay more, but by Harry, it's worth it.","positive"

"8692","Dated aircraft but good on time performance Boarding was efficient so the flight departed Changi right on time at 0930 hours, arriving MNL two minutes early at 1303. The flight was far busier than my connecting flight from Melbourne, and had about 280 passengers. Service from the crew was very slow. It took 75 minutes to get the basic meal and a drink. They just weren't as friendly as on the leg ex Melbourne. The KrsiFlyer entertainment menu is best in class: way above any other airline on which I've travelled (more than 20). The economy and business cabins both look somewhat dated even though the B773ER was only eleven years old. Overall, still better than many competitors but this 3.5 hour flight was not memorable.","neutral"
"5144","Far East journey With a 2 - 4 - 2 seating plan this aircraft gave the two of us some privacy. Dinner was served as soon as cruising level was reached, a choice of 2 main course was offered and was very tasty (beef). In flight tv had a vast scope of viewing and the flight past smoothly, as ever on Singapore Airlines the cabin crew were excellent.","positive"
"830","Very good After reading the reviews was expecting the worst, I needn't have worried. Excellent in flight service, especially from the crew. Pleasant food, champagne and nice wines by the glass. Seating very comfortable on this 787, though if you want to lie down your body is at an awkward angle and not conjusive to a good rest. Singapore Air did cancel one of my return flights to Perth which left me with a 12 hour stopover after flying in from Bangkok, but that's another story.","positive"
"1380","Taking Advantage. Due to Malaysia being on lock down and being forced to stop in our hotel rooms without any amenities we decided to return home early. Singapore Airlines charged us RM 2700 for changing our flights. As a frequent flyer on Singapore Airlines I think these charges are excessive when you take into account the World is in Crises. Thank you Singapore Airlines for your understanding and treatment of customers during this crises profit is obviously of more concern to you.","negative"

I arrived not feeling like I had been put through the ringer.","positive"
"11023","Sydney to Kolkata via Singapore. If it's Singapore Airlines then it's perfect. I have travelled on Emirates, Qatar, British Airways, Thai Airways, you name it. Over all these airlines I love Singapore Airlines. I travelled on a Airbus A380 from Sydney to Singapore and trust me they have the best seats and best food around. It was a pretty long flight and I never felt bored, to be honest I wanted to spend a little more time on the A380. Later that day I had a connecting flight to Kolkata. I spent a bit of my time at the lounge which was splendid. I was 10 mins away from missing my flight because I almost forgot what time it was when I was at the lounge. The flight to Kolkata was a red eye and pretty tiring one, but I asked the flight attendant if she could serve me hot chocolate after I wake up. Surprising just after I woke up she came to me and did her duty, and she even asked me if I wanted some food. If you're flying Business or even Economy it's got to be SIA!","positive"

"5796","Very disappointed! We were looking forward to our first flight very with SPA as we’ve heard nothing but good things. First thing I’d say is the 50 minute connection time they offer is hellish... don’t do it! We had to run for an age just to make the flight with no help from anyone! The plane was not bad when it came to comfort and the leg room was average. The entertainment was a massive disappointment as I’d heard they were supposed to be industry leaders.... they certainly aren’t! The service we received was in my opinion poor with the crew only offering random people drinks and flying past whilst collecting rubbish. We also got very little food considering the flight was over 13 hours. Speaking of food as vegetarians I had visited the website prior to Traval to book our veggie meals and confusing I couldn’t find a vegetarian option only specialised meal options like kosher, Muslim friendly and bland options amongst others. It did state that the food would be a menu so I assumed one of the options would be vegetarian.... you can guess the rest. Three options for the two meals... ALL MEAT! Also they didn’t have much else with the meals. I think I’ll stick to other airlines in the future.","neutral"

"153","Disastrous layover, at fault delays, and insulting customer service Subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused us to miss the connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as delayed passengers who miss connecting flights after a certain time at night should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention which covers delays due to fault of the airline. SQ senior customer service staff repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to essentially brush me off. There is a lot more to this story but currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and ""World's Best Airline"" reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore.","negative"
"2510","Flight almost empty, still charged for extra baggage. It was always my intention to buy additional baggage as I was over, however this was not possible online as the app would crash at the payment point. I was oddly directed to Agoda to complete the transaction. They had no clue why I was sent to them. Anyway once I arrived at the airport I was unable to self check in as there was an outstanding payment, I was sent to customer service who firstly said no worries the plane is half empty we have loads of space for luggage it’s fine just go check in. As I was checking in the guy received a call saying I now needed to pay and as such needed to go to the payment section with my bags. I went and explained the situation. They suggested I pay and claim a refund when I get to the other side. This didn’t sound like a good idea but I had no choice in the matter. I paid £243.00 charged at £16:25 per kilo. On arrival I did as suggested and challenged the charge this was on the 23 November, I have yet to receive a reply. I am so disappointed as normally Singapore Airlines are always very good and normally provide excellent customer service and it’s always been an excellent experience. I think it’s time for me use a new carrier.","neutral"
"9697","Standards have really fallen The quality of the service has really dropped over the years especially when compared with Qatar and/or Emirates. Our luggage was booked through from Zadar but Singapore airlines could not locate it when we finally got our boarding passes. We were told to check before boarding. Staff still could not locate our luggage and told us to check with ground staff in Singapore. No toiletry bags were given on the flight and normally this would not be a concern however had we not received our bags some toiletries would have been helpful. Our bags were located once we landed. The food was as bad as you would get in economy. Had two mouthfuls, that was enough. Just slapped on a plate instead of a tray. Pretty poor.","neutral"

Seat was comfortable and we managed some decent sleep. When my IFE did not work Singapore to Melbourne and we found out they knew about this before the flight and we should have been informed by the ground staff, the cabin staff including the Supervisor were very apologetic, checked in with us several times and compensated us with a generous voucher for the In-flight shop and a Business Class goodie bag.","positive"

As there was no other aisle seat available, I decided to check in first and then tried to change the seat at the airport counter. The ground staff told me that I should not have checked in online if I wanted to retain my original selected aisle seat, that did not make sense to me since the online check in was to facilitate the check in process. After much arguments, the supervisor was called and I was finally given an aisle seat. I was surprised that SIA has resort to make changes to our pre-selected seat without informing us. So what is the point of selecting your seat when booking the tickets? Really annoying practice and a disservice to your royal customers.","neutral"

The cabin was clean with 3-3-3 arrangement, the legroom was spacious, the food was delicious, I really enjoyed having ice cream as dessert. The FAs were friendly and corteous. The only downside of the flight was the inflight entertainment system; the content was good enough with plenty of new movies but the hardware really fell behind. The screen was not a touchscreen, it was small, blurry and pixelated. I suggest other travelers to bring their own headphones like I did because the earphones were not comfortable.

It was dirty, both our seats wouldn't return to the upright without pushing them up manually and both our meal trays were broken. As the aircraft powered up and made it's way down the runway I seriously thought it would fall to bits. The internal cabin furniture was shaking around very badly. The crew weren't particularly friendly and we both got missed continuously for refreshment. They ran out of some food and had to make up a breakfast for my wife.

"8","Very bad, disappointed Respected Faculty, I am Bincy, writing this to file a complaint regarding a cancellation of the connection flight of Singapore airlines and the irresponsible service from Singapore airlines airport staff members at Singapore .My parents 67 yr old Dad as 63 yr old Mom travelled from Brisbane airport in Singapore airlines SQ236 yesterday at 14.45 hrs and arrived at Singapore airport at 20.25hrs yesterday late evening. Then only they were informed that the connection flight SQ 536 which was booked and confirmed, has got cancelled and they have to wait until next day night. This was not informed to us in any form of communication. And secondly, though my parents are very older with so many health issues, (my parents are Diabetic also, taking insulin and my parents have high blood pressure, taking medications)but they had to wait in airport in a chair without any support for 24 hours without any food especially when they are from a non English speaking background. The mental stress and physical discomforts for 24 hours they were gone through are unimaginable and we cannot express it to the full extent. They didn't get any emotional or physical support from staffs at Singapore airport.They didn't arrange any room to rest or any proper lounge and not even any food for 24 hours (my parents were not prepared to stay at airport for more than 4 hours as we booked the tickets with least transit time at Singapore airport) We had a trust in the services of Singapore airlines, and so we booked the flight for our parents with much confidence. We booked the tickets through an agency Sanjo travels in India but we got the confirmation that Singapore airlines didn't inform the agency as well.

"8089","If you're going to have 24 hours of travel time, make it with Singapore Airlines I had to go to Singapore for a work trip from New York. In searching my flight options, I chose to go with Singapore Airlines because of the ""technical stop"" in Frankfurt, without having to change planes, yet still have an opportunity to get off the plane and stretch my legs for a few hours. Having not flown Singapore Airlines before, but hearing nothing but great things, I had a good outlook for the flight. Sure enough, the boarding process at JFK was fairly efficient. The aircraft for this flight is the largest airliner in the world, the double-decker A380 from Airbus. Once onboard, I found my seat in the economy section, and to my surprise, was very comfortable, roomy, and a decent amount of legroom for me, and I'm 5'10. If you're a bigger & taller, you may have issues. They also have a wonderful entertainment system on board, with a LCD screen right in front of you with a lot of recent & classic movie releases, not to mention TV shows, etc. There's plenty there to keep you busy, including keeping track of the flight. The staff on board, made of up most women, or as they call them, the ""Singapore Girls"" is on point when it comes to customer service. They are constantly available for anything you need and run a tight ship. On our flight, there were several drink and meal services and they were about as efficient as could be. The stop in Germany was a couple of hours and as I mentioned before, a welcome break before the longer haul to Singapore. Everything was smooth, comfortable, and better than expected. I would highly recommend this airline to any one!","positive"

I will definitely fly Singapore airlines when I can.","positive"
"10166","We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won’t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn’t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this “interrogation“ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn’t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents' actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines.","negative"

"5178","Really old plane This must be one of the oldest planes left in the fleet. I did a round trip on this 777 as part of a trip to Europe. The seats were nice and wide, but had had a lot passengers on them over the years. The controls were falling apart, but the worst thing about them was that they barely reclined at all. I was quite tired comic back from dubai and would have loved to stretch out. The service was very good as usual on Singapore airlines , the food was ok, as was the wine list. The entainment system also in the ok category. I believe they are upgrading the entire fleet in the next couple of years","neutral"
"8134","Wonderful Experience It’s been 3 years since my last flight after my pregnancy and childbirth. I was so looking forward to my ride after so long. It was my son’s first flight to Bangkok. The experience truly never disappoint. The airline managed to surprise my husband with an wedding anniversary cake on our flight there. My son enjoyed his plane ride so much that he keeps asking when our next journey will be. And the airline surprised us with another cake on our flight back to Singapore. What a great celebration trip it was for us!","positive"
"2051","Service level has deteriorated Unsure if it was the full flight that caused the drop in level of service. The wrong choice of meal was served. Not sure if that was caused by mislabeling. Not much of an apology preferred. Service was perfunctory when handing out snacks and water in the dark, though I had waved , they missed me twice. Guess I have to shout from my window seat next time. I know they serve camomile tea in business class and I requested for it as an aid for sleeping. Again, it was a perfunctory “no, we don’t have it.” Previously, they would make the effort to say they will check with business class for availability or maybe I have gotten confused with better service from other airlines???","positive"

"5188","Still a joy to fly A balm to the soul after our earlier connecting leg in economy on another airline. SQ business is always good - great and plentiful food, personable and friendly service (although there are always still differences between sets of crew even in J; if you get a good batch they really elevate the whole flight experience). The A350 seats were comfortable; a touch smaller than the A380 seats but larger than the 787 seats which are really more medium-haul at best. At night, the bulkhead seats give you more legroom when you go full flat, but you may have to deal with some light from the galley. Only negatives: One of the wife’s dishes (fajitas) was served with parts still cold; not sure if this was an issue from the dish itself, or poor preparation by the crew. Fortunately they did their best to rectify this quickly. Also, the wine list on J doesn’t seem to be as impressive as it used to be (cheap Chianti as an option, really?) But we know this latter is nit-picking somewhat. Would still recommend.","positive"

"9516","Disorganised, unhelpful, This was a return trip and we checked in online. Although we checked in 48 hours before the flight there was no option to change seats, even though that is supposedly offered. We were told to check with the desk in Singapore but they were completely disinterested and blamed Silk Air which was our connecting flight. I though they were part of Singapore AirlInes! Once on the flight they were disorganised and missed rows with meal service and drinks. We have always travelled with Singapore Airlines but they dropped the ball this time.","negative"
"314","Best Airlines only for First Class? Singapore Airlines is trying very hard to be the best airlines in the world. Probably it only applies to First Class. First of all, inflight meals of economy class were terrible. And I’m trying to reclaim my miles of my flight from SFO to YVR. (I booked that flight on SQ official homepage), Air Canada is the Star Alliance and SQ partner. The first stfaff (VK) replied me that “we will not be able to add miles for your Air Canada flight”. He has no knowledge that Air Canada is SQ partner. I told him that Air Canada is SQ partner airline and shows him a screenshort of my my KrisFlyer account, the claim missing miles page shows AC (Air Canada) is SQ airline partner and is able to choose to claim for missing miles. Then the 2nd staff asked me to attach all the documents to reclaim my miles. I’m still dealing with them and so far they have all different staff to reply me. (Aleady dealed with four different staff already). I think Singapore Airlines can do better than this. This is such a disappointment with the Airlines that chosen as the BEST in 2023. You really have to improve your inflight meal (economy class) and customer support’s quality.","neutral"
"2744","Price Match Guarantee - SCAM Very bitter taste in my mouth. I believe I have been mislead by Singapore Airlines who have been advertising a Price Match scheme. I spoke with one of their representatives who informed me that the $4400 I was about to spend would met their criteria for the scheme, resulting in me being able to gain a refund of $400. After paying in full I applied to have the scheme applied as per my previous conversation with their staff member. Apparently now, it does not met the criteria and they have refused to cancel my booking or honour the original scheme. On further investigation their T&C (once download as not in their initial T&C relating to this scheme) do show that my booking does not meet the criteria, however, I was told it did and they have call recorded and are still refusing to honour the agreement. Simple put, why would I pay additional $400 more than I had to unless I believed I would be refunded the amount back. I am unsure where I can go with this as Singapore have been extremely slow in responding and have basically told me 'too bad'...hence trip adviser.","negative"
"145","Singapore Airlines - Premium Economy - Rather underwhelming I specifically chose to fly with Singapore Airlines due to my positive experiences in their Economy Class from years ago. Having explored premium Economy options with various airlines since then, I was eager to give Singapore Airlines another try, considering their esteemed reputation and my previous impressions. Regrettably, the experience fell short of my expectations. Both legs of the journey, from Zürich to Singapore and back, featured uncomfortably cold cabin conditions. While the staff were friendly and hospitable, I didn't sense the distinctive Singapore Airlines ambiance I remembered. What disappointed me even more was the absence of an amenity kit. Additionally, having to share toilets with Economy passengers was less than ideal, resulting in lengthy queues reminiscent of standard Economy travel. The meal service was identical to what one would receive in Economy. While the privilege of checking in and boarding ahead of Economy passengers is granted in Premium Economy, I questioned whether it justified the higher price point. Personally, I found that the added value, aside from extra legroom, didn't justify the cost. I must admit that Lufthansa and ANA offer significantly superior Premium Economy services. They provide access to lounges and offer amenity kits (in the case of ANA). Even LOT surpasses Singapore Airlines in terms of attentive staff. Cathay Pacific also outshines Singapore Airlines in their Premium Economy offering, excelling in terms of food quality, attentive service, and the provision of a modest amenity kit.","negative"
"6700","A true five star airline Singapore airlines is one of the best airlines if have ever flown with. The flight attendants are true hosts.They deeply care for your wellbeing. The planes have stellar in-flight-entertainment, comfortable seats with good legroom and the food is quite tasteful. The best part is the stopover in Singapore: whenever you have the opportunity, choose a 24 - 48h timeframe for visiting this amazing city. But even 6 hours is fine - the transit area is one of the best I have ever seen.","positive"
"10569","Singapore to Canberra via Sydney. I have flown many times with economy airlines such as Jetstar and AirAsia. But my first ever flights with Singapore Airlines which I had high hopes for were a washout. The economy seats are much smaller than AirAsia and all you are getting for your extra dollars is a menu and entertainment options. Also I have an injury and asked for help getting on and off the plane before the crush. They made me get a medical certificate to prove the injury but let me on with every one else. And with a broken foot those small seats were even worse. I will return to AirAsia for future flights.","negative"

Their service is absolutely first class, from the captain giving us updates to the cabin crew that really and truly look after you for the duration of the flight. Flew on the A380 on the way to Singapore and it's still a marvelous aircraft to travel on. The cabin crew are extremely friendly and are more than accommodating to meet any needs required. The IFE (In Flight Entertainment) is fantastic, you're not going to run short of options here, you can watch TV, films, listen to music to your hearts content. All in all it is a great airline to fly on and hopefully I'll be flying with them again soon.","positive"
"8605","Should lift their game. My main complaint relates to the business lounge at Denpasar airport. This is VERY ordinary. Tired sandwiches and some other pre prepared offerings.

For the actual flight, I missed the personal vials of hand cream etc. Qatar Airways has a much better overall Business Class experience.","neutral"

The flight attendant was very apologetic and offered an alternative from the economy trolley. Although crew were very attentive and friendly, we did not feel that the extra cost of PE gave a better experience apart from some extra legroom and slightly wider seat. Qantas PE in our opinion is much superior and offers a more exclusive service if business class is out of reach..","positive"

From the check-in desk at Changi airport, through to the Krisflyer Lounge, and especially the on-board service, the experience was phenomenal. Sylvia was the flight attendant who looked after me and she was amazing. She made sure I was comfortable in my seat, brought out snacks for me and made sure my wine glass was fully topped up. Fantastic food provided by Singapore Airlines (notwithstanding I wasn't flying Business) and an amazing in-flight entertainment system with over 300 movies and 150 TV shows.

When travelling for the future, we will chose Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"5269","SingaporeAir became worst nightmare for budget travelers Don't get fooled by Singapore Air cheap prices. They started charging anywhere between $23 to $115 per seat to get seats together for family (otherwise they are giving individual leftover seats) and usual wait time at Singapore airport is anywhere between 8 hours to 24 hours. They started charging for few extra pounds in luggage and for many other onboard services.

"5628","The best airline in the world so far! We have been travelling with Singapore Airline for years but we have never written a review before. Singapore Airline has always been our choice airline when travelling to Asia and beyond. We have always had nice experiences with excellent service, friendly smiles and you always felt welcome when flying with Singapore Airline. The beds in business class on long haul flights are wide and spacious although on the recently renovated 380 they are not as comfortable as before and we hope this will not be the standard for the new Singapore Airline lie-flat bed on long haul flights. The A350 and B777 have great beds. There are no toilet amenities bags but everything is available, the only thing is that you don’t get is the bag to bring home, for those who think that it is important! The catering and wine selection is excellent and from most major departure airports you can choose your own meal through ‘Book the Cook’ service which gives you choice that most other airlines can’t even dream about. The choice of movies on in-flight entertainment is good but we would like a little more choice in Western/New Releases and Classic movies. We will recommend this airline to anyone who is looking for a comfortable long haul flight connecting through Singapore.","positive"
"5238","An good experience that could have been excellent! Picking SQ over others was an obvious choice since our experience with SQ last year was a very good one. The brand is known for it's quality services hence we went ahead and booked our tickets. I remember signing up for a vegetarian meal while booking my tickets however to our surprise the crew ran out of veggie meals and we were served cup noodles. It was surprising to say the least but the crew was courteous enough to serve us with additional items like ice creams and juices. For our return journey I wrote to the airline via email ensuring we are served with vegetarian meal. We were served with the desired meal however it was average and not really great but something is better than nothing. The quality of the meal offerings can be enhanced a bit. Apart from that, the experience flying with SQ is a good one. The in-flight entertainment is very good and the crew is very courteous and helpful. The aircraft's are always spic and span and the timings are also good/punctual.","positive"

We were brought hot towels immediately and were given menus before the service so that we could select our meals. The food was very good and the alcohol was complimentary during the flight.

Singapore Airlines did not disappoint and every part of the service from choosing the flight, checking in and disembarking was carried out smoothly, on time and with a genuine smile. The quality of food, drinks and choice available via the entertainment system was amazing. We had told the airline in advance that it was my wife's birthday the day we flew out and they made the flight extra special with a couple of glasses of fizz, a lovely cake, gifts and a handwritten note from the crew.

"11138","Flew from London Heathrow to Singapore Changi. With Singapore Airlines, there is always this high standard that most airlines aspire to achieve in terms of service. And because of this I am compelled to write one especially when they fall below their own minimum standards. This is one rare flight where the air stewardess was rude to a passenger, never smiling (forgiveable) and non apologetic when it came to dropping cutleries on her. To top it up, she even pouted annoyingly when the passenger was not awake when meal was served. Rare indeed, and ultimately undid all the good things her colleagues did on this same flight.","negative"
"8640","ALL the positives are true !!! My sister & I flew Singapore Airlines Premium Economy from NY-Singapore just last week. We flew in an Airbus A-380 and cannot comment enough at how comfortable our seats were. We had plenty of leg room and were able to recline an adequate amount to allow some sleep. There was a large video screen on the back of the seat in front us and we were supplied with large earphones. In addition, the list of available videos was truly impressive. The outer wall/window is a few inches from the seat contributing to a sense of spaciousness (we sat in the H-K row). We took advantage of the ""Book the Cook"" service and were very impressed with the quality of our meals. All attendants were very professional and welcoming. We feel we received excellent value for our money and would recommend SIA Premium Economy to anyone flying a long-haul flight. (We wish they flew to Hawaii, but alas they don't..) You know when you're offered Champagne at the start of a flight that you've likely made the right choice!!! Hope to fly SIA in the future. Excellent airline !!!","positive"

I had lobster and my wife and lamb, and it was cooked to perfection. A great innovation. However we were a bit disappointed that the lie flat beds meant to get our feet flat, we had to lie on an angle because of the seat in front.

In-flight entertainment caters to a diverse range of tastes and for someone who doesn’t sleep on a plane, I wasn’t at a loss for entertainment. Our luggage did not arrive in Joburg with us - not remotely the fault of Singapore Airlines but due to the extremely tight layover we were given.

As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row? Maybe SQ needs to inform pilots who is paying their high salary.","negative"

"4223","Usual great service on Singapore Airlines As usual the service on Singapore Airlines was top notch. We used ""book the cook"" where available to choose our meals on the flight and the food was pretty amazing. The flight attendants are always helpful and we love that they regularly go in and clean the toilets to keep them fresh. The in flight entertainment was pretty good too with enough new release movies to keep us occupied during the flight - even including the return journey. The check-in counters were also very efficient and helpful and the Kris Flyer Lounge more than adequate. In addition Changi Airport is an amazing airport and has plenty to offer travellers in the event of a longer stay between flights.","positive"
"5013","Unprofessional staff Mr. Dharamveer Singh was amazing at service and tried best possible effects to meet my preferences. But a lady - bit healthy was not at all professional. She was using unprofessional language while Mr. Dharamveer was processing my boardpass. Jaldi kro kaldi kro , side m khara kr do , aap side m khade ho jao were the phraseology used. Totally not acceptable. More over as I got confused with the seat allocation. I tried to get clarity from her, she used inappropriate facial expression and more over was extremely rude. This is not acceptable from a reputed airlines. Not a welcoming experience.","negative"
"5634","New Aircraft? I had a return flight SIN-NGO-SIN. I only review the return flight because I did one review in November 2017, so as to compare the same. It was same as SQ671, but I think this time round was a new aircraft as I could see the interior was very new. The legroom was definitely much bigger space compared to the one in 2017. With the bigger legroom, it was much comfortable for sure especially for my husband. And the toilets were very clean compared to my other past experience, no bad odor. This time was not stated any special on the menu, but was given choice of Japanese food and it was good, especially the dessert. Overall a very pleasant flight experience for people like me with tendency of air sick.","positive"
"5424","SQ LACK OF PAX CONCERN Great airline in the air but one of the worst on the ground. I had to change a flight recently and was directed to a call center. The experience defies description with misinformation, disinterest and lack of professionalism at the forefront however the most concerning was how my request to speak to a ""manager"" was handled. In the initial call, I was placed on hold for over 15 minutes which the operator tried to locate a ""manager"". Was eventually told that none were available as they were all in meetings but was assured a ""manager"" would call me back. It has now been almost a week and despite 2 further calls trying to speak to someone to resolve my issue and despite being assured that someone would call me back - NOTHING. I even asked for a telephone number in SIN I could ring but was advised they are not authorised to put a passenger in direct contact with the airline and the Filipino Call Centre could deal with the issue. Passenger issues are dealt with with distain and a lack of care. Shame on you Singapore Airlines. If anyone in Singapore Airlines are interested, my Krisflyer is 8080523886","negative"

"10041","Having last flown Singapore Airlines more than two decades ago, I was enthusiastic to fly again in their A350, albeit a short flight from Bangkok to Singapore. It began with a speedy Business Class check-in, with instructions to follow the signs to the SilverKris Lounge. Through Fast Track security, I headed towards the Gate 7 area, which was a fairly lengthy walk. Boarding was efficient. The first thing that impressed me was the gorgeous look of the cabin. It appeared in pristine condition. The cabin colour scheme of shades of mauve and light bluey-purple looked impeccable. Laid out in a 1x2x1 arrangement, this was a long-haul seating aircraft, operating on short-haul regional flights (sadly in Europe we have to contend with an 18-inch wide seat and 30-inch pitch, and no IFE). All the essential features of flatbed seating on this A350 were there. The seat functions on the side of the seat worked smoothly and effortlessly. A large pillow and blanket were placed on the seat. And on the side, was a small locker containing USB and power points, along with a menu and headphones. The pull-out mirror was a nice touch too. Preflight soft drinks came around, and requesting champagne, it was promptly served soon after. Just before pushback, hot towels were provided, and the safety video began with instructions to put on the 3-point seat belt (which has the shoulder strap). Once at cruising height, the breakfast service began. Being a short duration flight, the meal was served on a single tray. I was addressed by my name, and so opted for the Seafood Pad Thai, which came with prawns, scallops and fish cake - absolutely delicious. Without requesting, I was served with more champagne, followed by coffee. The touch-screen IFE worked well, and I noted a good selection of some of the very latest movies. I assumed that this was the same on all flights, as it wouldn't be possible to watch a 2-hour movie on a 2-hour flight. The headphones were a tad heavy and did not feel too comfortable. Overall, although the crew were non-engaging (short flight), the service was friendly and carried out with precision. It all came to an end too quickly, and I hope my next flight with Singapore Airlines will be a 'proper' long haul.","positive"
"6823","Amazing service 👌🏼 This was my first time traveling with Singapore air and what a pleasant experience! I had a long journey ahead and Singapore air made it easy by their amazing service.

"5285","Not so swish We were quite excited for our flight home with Singapore Airlines but it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The plane we boarded felt like it needed a bit of an overhaul. The seat when turned down to a bed was fraying in different areas. We felt that we were imposing on a few occasions when placing different requests. Our flight out from Sydney was with Emirates to Dubai and we couldn't fault it so we were quite excited to fly with Singapore Airlines being of the understanding that it was highly rated. There didn't seem to be a comparison. Maybe we were spoilt","positive"

I could have flown TG, AA or SQ if I had know. And now I have to fly you due to cancelation on a much later flight. In legal terms this is called fraudulent conveyancing - selling something know that you cannot deliver.

This is not 5 star restaurant, it is plane-food. Comparatively to other airlines, Singapore quality is way above average. SUMMING UP - 5 star rating on T.A. - simply for 5 start quality service. It is as simple as that, and ALWAYS a peasure to fly with this airline.","positive"

"4570","Best Airline for me and my family As a frequent traveller between Europe and Singapore, and also previously in and around Asia, no other airlines can compare!

So whether long or short flights, my family will choose Singapore Airlines whenever possible.","positive"

I called multiple times to confirm if they can help an elderly to check in at the hotel in Jewel Changi upon arrival to Singapore and they confirmed multiple times over the phone that that's something they always do. Guess what, on the day of, they refuse to send a non-English speaking elderly to the hotel and conveniently blamed it on the associates that told me in the first place. They recommend my elderly to sleep on the lobby in the terminal instead. What a service! Truly disappointed how this went down and they don't seem to care to accommodate anything. I would not recommend any minors, kids or elderly under SQ care because they are unprofessional, unreliable and has no empathy.","negative"

"8085","Seat #41C - The nightmare seat Selected the seat for extra leg room and regretted doing so from the moment I boarded the flight. From boarding passengers to air crew trolleys, all decided to encroach on my personal space by stepping on my foot to pushing their bags in my face. The 8+ hour flight was probably one of the most painful thanks to this “special” seat. Every time I tried taking a short nap I was rudely awakened to somebody stepping on my foot or another trolley banging into my knees. All I could do was stay alert the entire flight to save myself more pain. Personally, I would suggest the SQ team to try one of these seats themselves and let me know their flying experience! The least the airline could do is to have seat legends that warn passengers of possible risks associated with seats such as these. Similar to concert tickets wherein seats with restricted view are clearly called out letting the ticket purchaser know exactly what they are selecting and potentially getting into. I don’t think it’s the air crews fault or my fellow passengers but the seat position which stands out like a sore thorn. There’s minimal or no leg space unless you encroach on the leg space of the person to your left or one has to be of shorter stature themselves. I have been writing a number of reviews/ feedbacks for SQ over the last 10 years and every time I write one I tend to question myself if these are truly being read and actioned or just end up in somebody’s junk mail. Wrote this one to them on November 26 soon after landing and no reply as usual.","negative"

"1796","Singapore Air very uncomfortable sleeping accommodations When I travel a trip over 11 hours I am careful to get Business Class since I don’t want to get DVT. Really bad sleeping arrangement on SingaporeAir. Other people in my party traveling from Newark said the same thing. You cannot stretch out because the area where your legs go is at a diagonal to the area where your torso goes. You cannot stretch out because it does not have a seat that refines at all. The flight attendant has to “make your bed“ and then you cannot sit up anymore for the remainder of the flight unless you have the bed unmade. The mattress or sitting arrangement are very thin akin to the kind of mattress found in China. The flight attendants are very nice but the food selection is quite limited. The timeline for getting food is right away when you arrive on board and then halfway through the flight. This way you aren’t usually hungry at all after having breakfast in the airport lounge and either don’t eat and try to rest midway through the flight or you eat too early and are hungry again when you get off the plane. It takes a long time to get anything you request from the flight attendants. There isn’t enough water offered so you have to keep asking for a water bottle if you want to stay hydrated. There was a guy coughing in front of me and I requested a mask to wear since I could not get into my purse which was stuffed under the bed once it was made, but I did not receive one for at least a half hour. With the coronavirus, it was unconscionable that I had to wait so long. If you can take another airline for that $4000 fee, do so. They use Airbus so perhaps it is the way that an Airbus is configured as opposed to Boeing.","neutral"
"11062","Barcelona to Sao Paulo. First flight with Singapore Airlines and I was interested to see if travelling with Singapore would be substantially different to the experiences I had with AA/BA. I flew economy but the service in economy with Singapore Airlines was equal to that in business class on AA. The Boeing 777 has a 3-3-3 layout so a bit more spacious for those in economy. We had the bassinet seats at the front as I was travelling with my wife and 3 month old daughter. Food was great, frequent drinks brought around as were snacks and fruit. In flight entertainment great.","positive"
"443","Fly with them if you want to be involuntarily downgraded... I had originally booked on an A380 which offers their FULL business class product, and was downgraded to a REGIONAL A350 product which is usually used for their shorter (2-4 hour ish) routes. This is not acceptable for an 8 hour flight. What annoys me most is that I wasn't even told about it and thus wasn't even offered the chance to rebook. The cabin crew were great, but I didn't get what they paid for - after countless emails and escalations, I still can't find anyone who cares.","negative"
"1118","Good service on the flight but overcharged on extra luggage The service from the stewards was very good and the food good for an airline. However, I was moving so I brought with me plenty of luggage. I was over the weight limit as I expected but I was ok with paying more as I didn't have much of a choice. Neither legs of the flight were busy. Not many people at all and most passangers had 3 seats to themselves. Despite this they charged me over 1100NZD for the extra weight on my checked in luggage. While I understand there are set prices for extra weight, I think based on the lack of passengers, they shouldn't be charging so much and could have shown some decency.","neutral"
"10076","The ground service was appalling. Singapore Airlines does not seem to have much of a presence in Dubai anymore and DNATA handles everything. To say that the check-in counter staff was inefficient and ignorant would be an understatement. She did not even know that Scoot Airlines is a partner of SQ and had no clue about which terminal it operates, and worse still she gave the wrong information. In-flight service and food were excellent as usual but on arrival, the ground staff were again inefficient. IFE was outstanding and the free wifi was well appreciated. SQ has a weird policy of not providing amenities and will only offer it if asked for.","positive"

"1873","Seats too close We had an almost-new, spotlessly clean A350-900 crewed by very capable and pleasant flight attendants for the 8-hour flight. Food was very good and service faultless, but we could not watch anything whatsoever from the extensive in-flight entertainment range, as the people in the seat in front of us opted to recline their seats, forcing the screen to be no more than a hand's width from our faces, completely blurring anything n the screen. Also, the seat was hard up against my wife's knees (she's only 5'3""). We thought about reclining our seat to get away from it, but felt that those behind us would face the same discomfort as we did, so didn't. The plane is lovely to fly in, it's modern and quiet, but the seat issue will continue to create problems unless something is done about it. Happy to fly SQ but perhaps I should save up for business class next time.","positive"

Leg room nonexistent on the A350-900. It was obvious that the economy cabin was packed in like sardines to compensate for the sleeper seats in Business class.

However, I’m not sure I’d recommend them otherwise, at least not for premium economy. I flew once on regular economy and it was okay. However, my flight in premium economy was disappointing. Cathay is MUCH better for this class. Seats are much wider and have a much greater foot rest extension on Cathay. Your feet barely lift off the ground on Singapore Airlines. As well, Cathay has much better food. SA food made me very sick. Cathay also provides a welcome drink and amenity kit. I was very disappointed because SA advertises that they give this to premium economy, yet I did not receive either. To top it off, flight attendants decided to come up with a crafty lie once they were caught being racist :)","negative"

"8650","I expected more In general, SQ's service has always been good. Trusted by my family since the 80s. As much as I would like to support local, I would only take SQ if the price is right. There was a deal for this trip to HK that made flying with SQ more desirable than taking budget. The seats felt awkward for me. I am 1.58m but I felt that that the table was too low for me. There was only noodles left by the time the service staff came to me & unfortunately part of the noddles was hard. So I only ate half of it. To my surprise, the coffee cup that came with my tray of food was broken. I was still eating the hot dish when the air stewardess was came around with ice cream. So I told her, ""Maybe later."" Without prompting, she came back after my meal to ask if wanted my ice cream now. The movie selection was updated & I couldn't resist watching 2 shows on board.","positive"

The in-flight entertainment has a good variety of movies, TV, music and other distractions. The WCs were cleaned regularly. My only quibble is the A350 seats have less padding than on other aircraft, so I wouldn't want to sleep but this flight (1205 out of BCN, 0700 into SIN) can be considered a daytime flight from the perspective of BCN time) if you have a a day hotel to check into at SIN. Also I didn't discern any advantage in paying extra for a forward zone seat as I had the opportunity to compare it with a normal economy seat.","positive"
"2714","Always a Pleasure It is hard to look forward to a 20+ hour flight, but Singapore Airlines makes this possible. The attention to detail for even Economy passengers makes every trip a pleasure.

I am so excited to try the nonstop flight from Newark to Singapore next month.","positive"

"10800","First time flying on the A350 and it makes the flight from Munich to Singapore considerably more comfortable than on the 777. As usual Singapore Airlines staff were friendly and professional, as we were traveling with a toddler, we were invited to board first and get ourselves settled. Stewardess came by to check if we needed anything for our daughter and if we would like our meals at different times. Seats were comfortable, row 41, which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight, I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly.","positive"
"1138","No customer service at all and had to chase my refund I had to cancel my flight due to a positive covid test and there were no other flights to Perth for the foreseeable future that I could see online. I tried to call to find another flight but they never answered, I was just put on hold. In total I waited five and a half hours on hold. The worst was when I waited 2 hours and 35 minutes on hold to be cut off by Singapore. So, I had to cancel online. 30 days later no money in my account. I followed up by email and was given some ridiculous excuse of the call centre in Rome going through to Greece - made no sense. I had a fully refundable ticket for cancellation yet they demanded a covid test result or doctors certificate before they would give me my money back. I pointed out that I had a fully refundable ticket and did not need to give a reason to cancel. Eventually they agreed to refund my money as an exception (I didn't need an exception) but I really had to chase and work for it. Even then the woman I was dealing with made it sound like she was making a real exception in giving me a refund and that in future I should make sure I keep all paperwork for special circumstances, ignoring that my ticket was fully refundable with no fee.

"3040","Bumped off Premium Economy flight - No response from Customer Service Manager Booked a premium economy flight via Verve Travel Management (Hello World Travel) on St Kilda road Melbourne, I later selected my seat online. When checking in the night before the early morning flight there was no booking and I had been what appeared moved to another flight for some reason. After calling Verve Travel and Singapore Airlines nobody could provide with me an answer, Singapore Airlines stated that there was 0.1% chance of getting my seat back. I was forced to go the airport at 5am to see if i could get onto the flight. This was a number of months ago and after 35 emails and constant requests for answers Singapore Airlines and the Customer Affairs Manager responded once (blaming her managers) and to this day have never resolved the matter. Incredibly disappointing as I though they were much better that that....especially on a premium economy seat. I will keep on trying to get a fair outcome.","negative"

"8394","Disappointing Business Class experience Booked Singapore Airlines economy, then decided to change to Business Class despite the huge difference in fares. Singapore airlines charged $300 per ticket to change which was the first disappointing thing - we were already paying a huge amount. they have ""book the Cook"" for business and first class passengers where you can choose your meal before departure. I tried to do this but for some reason it didn't save to our booking. the food provided was absolutely awful. Tough scallops and prawns, then almost inedible main courses. Very disappointing. The staff were helpful and lovely and the seats/beds were comfortable. I contacted Singapore Airlines in Singapore and asked them to book our meals for our return journey as I still could not get them to save to our booking. the return trip was much better - the plane was nicer, the food was excellent. I have flown SA before in economy and found them to be very good so it was extra disappointing to find Business so ordinary. Fortunately our return journey went some way to alleviate our disappointment from the trip over.","neutral"
"1713","Singapore Holiday In flight service was faultless and wine and food selection and quality was even better than our expectations which were preset at a very high level. Simply outstanding.

This trip was mum's 80 birthday celebration and we were concerned how well she would handle the long flight. We went from Wellington via Melbourne and this workperfectly with brief visit to Melbourne lounge both ways. She arrived there and home fresh and rested on arrival.. Flight staff really looked after every one.","positive"
"11070","Check in at Melbourne Airport was efficient. Terribly disappointed at the inflight service, quality and quantity of food offered (and I don't have a large appetite) plus the age of the aircrafts. SQ tickets are not cheap and not having travelled with SQ in a while, I was so looking forward to my flight given the inflight service reputation which in my opinion has gone to the ""dogs"". Aircraft was old and used my wet towel to clean the tray table and mess. No bar service - just a round of juice, beer and sparkling wine before the meal, which was a beyond belief. Hot casserole and bread and nothing else - not even salad or dessert. Asked the steward for bottle water and was told they only offered tank water. I said I don't drink tank water and he brought me a small bottle from BC. Breakfast was a terrible meal too. On the return one round of Bar service provided this time. Same story with bottle water request and cabin staff brought me a few extra sealed cups of water off other pax trays. Again, horrible breakfast with a hard cold muffin and a poor fruit salad. Seats were small and cramped.","negative"
"11053","There's a simple reason why Singapore Airlines is always rated amongst the very top airlines in the world. They're excellent. Both their hard product and soft product are very impressive and consistent which is not easy to achieve. This 17.5 hour flight from Singapore to San Francisco (via Hong Kong) is absolutely heavenly. The 777-300ER has the next gen First Class cabin which is noticeably different from the previous first class. The leather is firmer, the design more fresh with subtle colour adjustments and the seat has many new compartments to store all your onboard 'necesseties'. The IFE has also been completely revamped with a great new remote system which is very intuitive and easy to use. Love that you can now quickly rate movies that you watch. The dining is amazing. As if I was sitting in a fine restaurant in town. I love ordering via Book the Cook for I can specifically choose my meals for every part of the flight. Excellent job SQ.","positive"
"10572","Singapore to Surabaya. I always fly Singapore airlines for work, and it has been getting worse by the day. The flight is perpetually delayed.

However, among all of it, it has always been the late departure over and over is the one that I think is the biggest pain.","negative"
"14","Never again. Well I have flown to Australia quite a few times with other airlines. Also flown many counties around the world. But I have a fear of heights and flying. I just try and keep my mind off that I'm in the air. Most flight will get a bit of turbulence now and then. It can't be helped, but both the 13hr flight from Heathrow to Singapore. Then the connecting flight from Singapore to Sidney had severe turbulence for 90% of each flight. It was literally like travelling down a bumpy road for the whole journey on both flights with the patches of extra bad turbulence. I spent the whole 2 flights terrified and shaking. Not what you want when flying for 20hrs with a fear of flying. I mean I know turbulence can't be helped, but how could I possible have consistent permanent turbulence for basically the entirety of 2 flight from one side of the world to the other. I don't know if you teach your pilots to fly a certain way, or maybe take short cuts somehow. But it was one of the most terrifying couple of days in my life. And the worst thing about it is I have to fly back with them in 2 weeks","negative"
"4745","The Best! Singaporeairlines premium economy is the best affordable way to fly! I say affordable when you take advantage of the specials, which ia quite often. In my case from JFK to KL was the price of economy for premium economy seating! U get more options for meals pre booked twelve hours before flight! U get served first! naw that’s awesome. Food quality was great so was the service, the pick up after meal was took a little longer but hey nobody is perfect but for Singapore it was damn close. Tip: if u wanna take advantage of the specials, long haul flights usually got pretty good deals but no stopover except for transit, if u decide to stopover in Europe en route to Asia, it’ll cost you significantly more but it’s worth every penny. For me Singapore, Emirates and Qatar are best!","positive"
"4402","Singapore Air Always efficient, friendly and as comfortable as economy can be. is there any solution to.

Traveling back to New Zealand on this flight - had exit row seats in economy on an A380-800. probably seems good on booking but didn't enjoy the space seated in the seat. The seat just didn't seem wide enough? The ability I get straight out and stand up was great, but the nearness to the outlets was a let down. The food was. average to poor and wasn't what I remember pre-COVID. The flight was clean and crew kept the toilets very clean, but a full flight and seems the titles were always in use. In hindsight should have booked a window and aisle seat and hoped no booked the middle seat - lesson learned. Overall I found the standard of service had dropped and wasn't as good.","neutral"

"4040","Much vaunted Business Class disappointing Having read so many rave reviews of Singapore Airlines, when I couldn't get a direct flight at a reasonable price (my own fault for going in August) I decided to fly with them Hong Kong - London - Hong Kong via Singapore, despite the journey time being so much longer (17 hours vs 12 hours direct). On the plus side, all 4 flights were on time and the fare was good value for Business Class on this route. The first leg, 4 hours HK-Singapore, was fine - very comfortable seat where you could put your feet up, bottle of water at your seat, latest model touch screen entertainment system. The 13 hour Singapore-London was much less good - luckily I'd read reviews which recommended getting bulkhead seats as those are the only ones where you can rest your feet comfortably - all the others have the foot stool to the side so you have to sit twisted round. Although the seats are very wide, when folded into lie-flat beds only half the width is available and when I stretched out my head touched one end of the bed and my feet the other: I'm 5'8"", so this is seriously inadequate for really tall passengers. The entertainment system is old-fashioned, with no touch screen, although the headphones are good quality. Coming back, while the London-Singapore leg was the same, the aircraft for Singapore-HK had been downgraded to an older model - seats were wide and comfortable but you couldn't put your feet up, I had to pile up pillows and blankets myself to get my feet just a bit elevated. Unfortunately for me, my ankles swell up if I can't have my feet up, one of the main reasons I fly Business Class on long haul flights, so this was a real problem for me. The staff clearly didn't want to deal with this, so they pretended not to see it - although they did offer me extra chocolates as they could see I wasn't happy. On all 4 flights, the wines were good, so was the coffee, but the food was no more than OK, certainly not living up to the hype that Singapore Air is a gourmet experience, I've had much better food on other airlines, so this was a real disappointment. Breakfast (which I didn't bother with) was distinctly weird - choices were Asian (fair enough), sickly sweet waffles with cream (not for me!) or some kind of concoction with caramelized onions instead of a normal eggs and bacon type offering. The connection at Singapore on the outbound flight was fine, on the return flight arrival and departure were in different terminals and it took an hour to get from where we landed to where the next flight departed, the last thing you need after a 13 hour flight. As for the famous cabin crew service, it's certainly attentive and polite - one thing I did appreciate was that the flight attendants hurried to help you getting luggage in and out of the overhead compartments, which some airlines seem to have a policy against. On the other hand, there's a certain stinginess about the airline which is quite unattractive - I've done the HK-London trip in Business Class on 7 different airlines and this is the only one which doesn't give you a little goody bag with toothbrush, moisturiser, etc. You do get a pair of cheap slippers and socks (which of course the airline can use again if you don't open them) and there are toothbrushes in the toilets, but although it's a stupid little thing the gift bag is the kind of touch that makes you feel welcome and valued. In the same way, when I used the shower at the SilverKris lounge at Heathrow, there was no shampoo, conditioner or body lotion as there is in the showers at other airline lounges - instead there's a notice saying ""if you want amenities you have to ask for them"". And why give passengers a bottle of water on a 4 hour flight, but not on a 13 hour flight? Again, the only one out of the seven airlines not to do this. While the biggest problem for me was the length of the journey - I wouldn't use this route again for that reason alone - I'm afraid that I just didn't take to Singapore Airlines and am quite bemused that so many reviewers clearly love flying with them; I certainly don't plan to do so again.","neutral"
"11514","SQ319 from LHR to SIN on the 777 300ER with new business class. Generally a good flight with excellent service good food and fantastic entertainment. The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing. Other than the poor bed / seat and lack of an amenity kit a good flight.","positive"
"2046","The A350-900 is a massive upgrade for the Wellington-Melbourne-Singapore service The Singapore Airlines A350 in economy is amazing, good entertainment and comfortable seat. Singapore Airlines also has great delicious food. The crew was also great but I did ask for a Sprite a never recived it. Overall great product and great service. The aircraft was only 2 years old 359 and was Comfortable and quite. Overall I would highly recommend flying Singapore Airlines to Wellington. In economy I would recommend sitting in seat 55a for a great wing view.","positive"
"9313","This is for Manila to Singapore and back I mean, it's singapore airlines, it's your best option flying from Manila to Singapore. And the ticket prices, if gotten early, will be almost the same price as Cebu pacific's. Inflight entertainment ... you have your own big lcd screen infront of you with hundreds of movies, tv series, documentaries, whathaveyou to choose from. You actually beg that you can buy extra time to be able to finish what you are watching. That said, the USB port they give you is useless for current phone models that need higher amps to charge. Food wise.. I have to be honest.. it's starting to be crappy.. Philippine Airlines level crappy. It's possible that it is for just Manila to Singapore flights... so do consider that when you read this review. HOWEVER, they made up for it by giving us ice cream cubes for dessert. overall, always check cebu pac's prices first, then check on singapore and philippine airline's if they're about the same price. Singapore airlines should always be your first choice because you will be given a more pleasurable inflight experience.","positive"
"193","Not for the elderly or people with disability The airline is good for the experienced, able-boded traveller. However, if you are elderly, person with disability or requiring assistance, I would suggest you find alternative airlines. Their support staff is horrendous in terms of providing appropriate assistance to those who need it the most. The Live chat agents are also hopeless (don't waste your time) and feedbacks/complaints take a while to be responded to. As I said, if you are able to navigate well, are tech-savvy or well-travelled, you're all good. You will have a comfortable flight. However, if you are someone likely to require the airlines' assistance, forget it. Their support staff is horrible.","negative"

"6575","AS GOOD AS IT GETS The 777-300 could well be the best aircraft in the Singapore Airlines fleet. The business class seat is truly amazing. The seat itself is very spacious and comfortable. The aircraft has an overwhelming roomy feel. It may be because there's no overhead storage in the middle of the aircraft makes such a difference. Our flight was the usual SQ standard - we had a delightful meal and when ready for sleep the steward was standing at the ready to assist. The flat bed on this aircraft seemed even more comfortable than usual. In fact it was more comfortable than a few hotels we'd slept in on the trip! Our best advice: if you can afford to fly Singapore Airlines - do. You won't be disappointed.","positive"
"7863","Absolutely easy and comfortable nonstop direct flight from Newark to Singapore We flew business class to Singapore, and premium economy the way home and were very happy with both legs of the trip. I was worried about such a long flight, but loved not having to stop enroute. It made the trip much easier and shorter. Business class service, as usual, was fantastic. What was really a wonderful surprise was how comfortable premium economy was including the food, seats, space, service and entertainment. I was worried about not flying business class, especially on such a long flight, but had such a good experience that we would fly premium economy any time again with Singapore Airlines. The food wasn't served as beautifully, and the liquor selection wasn't as expansive, but it was still quite good. We used the Book the Cook feature on the way from Singapore to Newark, but next time, would stick with what is served on the flight, especially the Canyon Ranch menu which looked really good. I have trouble sleeping on airplanes and often my back hurts from sitting too long. Neither was a problem on either flight. The lighting and sleep cycles, the roomy feel to the plane and the cabin pressure being set at a lower altitude were also great features that made the trip so wonderful.","positive"

"4993","Still the best airline for me I am a frequent traveller and had taken many flights with different airlines for my business and leisure trips. I must give compliments to SIA for the great airlines that it is. From the caring, friendly service that the crews provide to the safe, clean planes that usually arrive to the destination on schedule. I have been travelling with SIA for over 25 years and they are still the best in the business despite the challenges coming from the ""oil fuelled"" airlines which can provide excellent service at lower prices. I have taken flights to Bangkok using Thai Airways, their service and plane is not at the same level and if the price for airfares are not too far away, I will always choose SIA. I have tried travelling with Scoot due to an urgent meeting arrangement but the experience was really bad. On the return trip, their plane had issues and were delayed for a few hours. On this trip, there were no surprises and that's what I like about SIA. No surprises are good for me.","positive"

"10824","Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other’s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess’s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn’t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ’s “book the cook” option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn’t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn’t great. I wasn’t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I can’t recommend SQ and probably won’t chose to fly with them again.","negative"
"11155","Adelaide to Tokyo via Singapore. Excellent dedicated check in for Premium Economy and Business Class and staff friendly and efficient. Boarding was efficient with lines for Elite Gold and Premium Economy Passengers. Seat was well cushioned and very comfortable. More then enough legroom with an extended footrest. Compartments on either side of the seats for mobile phones and other small devices. Compartment in the front of the seat large enough to fit a 15 inch laptop and an iPad. Smaller spaces in the console can easily fit 2 water bottles. Tray tables extend out of the centre console. Entertainment was standard with a 13 inch HD screen and a fantastic selection of movies and a less than desirable selection of TV Shows. Flight Attendants were attentive and friendly, doing checks of the cabin and there if you needed anything. Food was sufficient but I wouldn't say it was anything impressive. Beverage selection was fairly extensive even serving champagne before take off. WiFi was expensive and only came with 30MB but the ability to use roaming services on board was good.","positive"

"653","USE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AIRLINE BUT NEVER THIS THIEF OF AN AIRLINE I was heading to Bali for my honeymoon until I got stopped by one of Singapore agents. She stated that my wife cannot depart the plane because her passport expires in May 2023 which is less than 6 months based on Bali’s requirements. However, after many discussions with the agent and trying to find a solution, she said nothing can be done and gave us a ticket number to follow up. These guys took my money 4 or 5 months ago right after I booked my ticket! But when I requested a refund, I get the answer that I have to wait “1 to 2 weeks” which is very unacceptable as I am looking to book another flight with that money! Also, when I asked for a confirmation email! I kept getting the same answer which is ""No"" I am very very very displeased with the service I got from your agent which was super super rude! and even called the Police because I asked her the question few times! this is very unprofessional from the so called, ""Singaporean Airline"" which was once the best airline out there!! The agent kept blaming me and not even trying to take some responsibility for a fault the Singaporean airline website had caused! I booked my ticket with the same expiry date! their system never stopped me when reading my documents! How am I supposed to know that there’s such a requirement that would stop me from traveling. The agent was super super super rude and very unhelpful and very unprofessional! I really thought booking with the Singaporean airline would be the best option but it’s the worst decision I’ve ever done, and I travel a lot! The agent was not even trying to show some empathy and help two newly married couple who was heading to their honeymoon but on the contrary, she insisted to make the experience even more worse!","negative"

"610","Dealyed/lost luggage and no information from Singapore Airlines Singapore airlines deliberately decided not to load my vessel with my suitcase and gave me no heads up in regards to this. When I arrived at my final destination - after 2 other stops - , I didn't see it, went to the baggage claim desk and was told that the aircraft was too heavy to carry my suitcase - I never even conceived that an airline could actively simply decide that, without any communication or negotiation, they could just not load your luggage and leave you waiting for it, powerlessly, at the airport; and then have you go through all the stress of chasing it for days. They opened a ticket to track my suitcase and many emails have been sent saying that it hasn't been found yet. Their Brisbane office does not answer the only phone number provided to me. Sydney's office took literally one hour to answer my call and said it was able to find it and assign a flight to it, which should arrive tonight - 2 full days after my arrival -. I have WET clothes in there that are being damaged and damaging other goods while they don't send the suitcase, and other important articles for my everyday use, like clothes and leather shoes to go to work. I'm having to work from home as a result, against my company's policy. Although Sydney said there was a flight assigned to my suitcase, I kept receiving emails saying it wasn't located yet, and that they ""were doing their best"" to find it, so I also had contradictory information from their team. I wasn't given a final date to have this resolved, nor any sort of compensation offer from the airline. This is very poor customer handling and has ruined that entire Singapore Airlines experience, which already hadn't had any stand-outs. Solely for that reason, I would NEVER advise anyone to fly Singapore Airlines. Ever.","negative"

Anyway, beyond price which was my driving factor, as well as many of the other passengers, the service was great, seats comfortable, good luggage allowance, and even the meals (Perth to Singapore leg) were even pretty nice for airline food.

"2583","Flying High There are other airlines I put ahead of Singapore. On this particular flight I found the cabin crew were not as friendly as I would have expected. The food was ok, typical airline food I thought. The movies available were not what I normally watch but did manage to watch a couple and close down one which I thought was garbage, Once upon a time in Hollywood. I am only 160cm so legroom isn't a problem for me on any airline my knees do not touch the seat in front of me.","positive"
"2421","Favorite airline First time traveling premium economy and it was amazing. Plenty of leg room, loved the recliner action of the seat, very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant and food good.","positive"
"8131","Never Fly Singapore Airlines unless you are in First Clas . Economy is absolutely out of I took the Red eye that left for Beijing at 1:00 A.M. that got into Beijing at 6:30 A.M. My seat was in the middle . The service stunk and so did the food . It was the flight from hell. If you aren't in first class you don't exist .","negative"
"7907","Great service and value for money We just flew from KL to Tokyo Haneda via Singapore and back. The flights were on time and even arrived earlier for the Changi - Tokyo leg and back. The seat and cabin environment was good with the cabin crew being very attentive and service orientated. For the outbound flight to Tokyo which was the late night flight, the crew regularly walked around and attend to passengers' needs. There are no complaints on the inflight meals and entertainment which had a wide choice in terms of movies, music and TV series. The cabin even had the Christmas feel. Overall was satisfied with the flights we were on.","positive"
"8715","World Class Airline I have flow Singapore Airlines many times in the pass some for business some for pleasure. I have flown both business and economy and I have flown them from Boston MA USA to Singapore which is a very very long flight 30 hours and I have done it in both business and economy. Business class is excellent and lucky for me it was paid by my company. Just a little about the service in business class the seat you had reclined into a bed, the food was outstanding and the service was too I have flown other airlines also both business and economy class. Singapore is really outstanding. Now economy class not the same as business but it was also very good the service was very good the food also and the seats didn't go all the way back like business but I was still able to get my rest on the flight. They also had a small entertainment screen on the in front of you which was also very nice. That all being said you have to remember that they are not a budget airline so you will pay more so you need to do your shopping for price but for me they are one of my favorite airlines to travel on a really first class overall airlines.","positive"
"6616","Excellent We have flown both Economy and Business Class, and both provide excellent food and service. This is our 7th flight using Singapore Airlines and we will always choose them when possible. Boarding at LAX was a nightmare, with a crowded terminal with no seating and tardy buses taking us out to our plane, which was mostly the fault of the airport, but the airline employees could have been better organized. The in-flight entertainment includes newly released movies as well as television shows from all over the world.","positive"
"4516","Most helpful crew Had the pleasure of flying with Singapore Airlines again to Koh Samui, Thailand. Always excellent service with quick bag drop at counter and speedy boarding as per usual. Cabin crew were fantastic on outbound and return flight but have to give a huge thank you to the most attentive and caring crew on the way back from Singapore. My husband wasn't feeling too well and it seemed quite hot on the aircraft. Cabin crew were very prompt in providing him with cold compresses and ice water so that he was more comfortable. If not for this I'm not really sure how he would have coped on the long flight home. The crew manager also came to check on him during the flight...very kind and caring indeed.","positive"
"771","Try another airline instead Dirty and broken toilet parts. The same confusing signs from decades ago, encouraging illiterate passengers sticking rubbish into wrong holes. Yuck. Why not change them, they obviously don’t work! Seat pocket not cleaned before my flight, still someone else’s rubbish in there. Gross. Coeliac disease-no snacks for you on board at all. Dangerously ignorant staff-“why don’t you just have these nuts and crackers anyway?” Rude staff-most requests were be met with a loud explanation of how I must let them finish what they’re doing first, so that every other passenger who heard would think I was bossing them about.","negative"
"2072","Super flight The timing of the flight is amazing. Absolutely no jet lag. We leave JNB at 2230 and reach Singapore at 3 pm. By the time we settle down, it’s bed time.

"697","Staff are great, planes average and after service is poor We flew to London Via Sinapore and the plane to Brisbane was so uncomfortable, the seats hard and when reclined tilted forward making it hard to get comfortable. The staff were good offering refreshments at times although seemed to take a long time to get to serving. a special request meal was basically tomoato and pasta and no extra. The flight between Singapore and Heathrow was better the staff were great. the meals were better. The flight back to Singapore we upgraded at great cost to business class which was great. The facilities are getting a little dated now but it was good and the meals etc were good. The retrun to Brisbane was ok and seemed better than the way to Singapore. We felt dissapointed we did not receive a breakfast or something before arriving as we arrived early in the morning Brisbane time and had not had anything to eat for a while. To add to this, our luggage was damaged. we had it wrapped in Brisbane, but it looked like it had been crushed in something. I submitted a claim and no response and despite many attempts at responding to the online response and also calling, I have had no response and anyone on the phone is not able to assist. I also noticed we did not receive out miles for the Business Class upgrade and again it is still ongoing. I submitted a milage claim online and received it was rejected and now I have had to provide details to try and get it looked at. Woudnt it be in the system????? I used to think Singapore Airlines was a good airline but now do not think so unless you are willing to pay significantly more.","negative"
"636","Flight cancelled without previous notice SQ468 flight was cancelled on the 24th December 2022 without previous notice. As per the air ticket the transit time was only 50minutes. However, because of the cancellation the transit time was more than 24hours. I paid extra to get a less transit flight to my aged parents. No hotel was provided. My aged parents are stuck in the airport. I wouldn’t recommend Singapore airlines to anyone or will not go via Singapore airlines in the future.","negative"
"8589","Memorable flying experience I am the tripadvisor member for quite sometime, but this is my first review and I wanna write for the helpful and friendly cabin crew Shahilah and Cheri who make my 13hrs flight from Singapore to London on 18 Oct SQ 318 comfort and smoothly, they are attention to detail, friendly and warm welcome. Even though I’m taking economic class but they still provide the professional service to all the passengers including myself. I really wanna thanks Shahilah, Cheri and her team (one of the short hair lady I forget to take her name) to make my long hours flight comfort and enjoyable. Well done and keep it on :)","positive"
"3615","Disappointing food Boarding handled OK. Small champagne offered on being seated (seat 18F). Second glass equally small and really insufficiently chilled - nuts, also served, were warm and fine. Meals were less than hot and one, the lamb meatballs, were served with what was referred to as 'toasted crostata' which were large chunks of bread which were soggy and not crisp, as they should be. I realise that preparing food at 35,000 feet is no easy task but expected better. On a positive note, the seats are fine and well designed with plenty of storage room and quite comfortable. The crew was also attentive and helpful. A not unpleasant experience by any means but I expected a bit more. Now if we could combine Air New Zealand's food with Singapore Airlines seating we would have a winner!","positive"
"9235","So far, only the best airline This flight was a returning to New Zealand after one month holidays in Portugal. My review will be based on my experience only and will share my personal opinion regarding the flight and wont consider the airport, lounges, etc for the results of this review as the airports are mainly managed by other companies than the airlines. Important to refer that we were flying with our two small girls, 2y and 4y at the time, and this can give support to other families. On the first leg, between Frankfurt and Singapore, we went on boar of the 777-300ER with the new interior. I love the A380 aircraft, but this one from Singapore is outstanding. As soon as we went on boar (late due to the ""organization"" of Frankfurt airport and ground staff support) we received a warm welcome on board. They were very concern about the comfort of the kids, something that several airlines forget about. - Drinks given before take-off they were ok ( I prefer Etihad Mocktails) - cabine is very well designed - seats very comfortable, even though I prefer the ones on other airlines where a wider space is provided for your feet's when on a lay down position. - food is really good. Very good quality of the products, mainly the cheese. Few variety but very good, - entertainment was good, very similar to the other airlines. - nice games, puzzles, colouring sets and others have been provided to the kids, - food and drink always available - Singapore opted for a type of seats that wont allow you to swap from seat to laydown position without leaving your seat (refer to several videos online). you will need to stand up and call for assistance if you don't know how to do it. It can be considered not the desirable but it provide definitely an higher comfort for a better sleep. Staff is very kind and always around to support, and even to pamper our little ones. The only negative point was the flight between Singapore and Christchurch, as the aircraft is a 777-200 with quit old interior. Screen very poor quality, and less entertainment (movies). rather than that, all the quality from Singapore. Will recommend anyone to consider Singapore on their next flights, as you can have much more for less money. Our coming trip will be through Singapore for sure.","positive"
"886","Premium economy downgrade nightmare We have been downgraded on SIN to MEL leg of our flight from Premium Economy to Economy. No explanation just an email. It turns out they have changed aircraft from Boeing 777 to Airbus A350 which only has no premium economy cabin Multiple calls to Australian contact centre based in Changi. Requested to change LHR > SIN> MEL to earlier flights but on the same day SQ 317/SQ217. SIA refused citing capacity block in UK until Sept 11 2022. This apparently prevents them from moving me from original flights to new flights despite no change in passenger numbers. I can of course if I want book 2 seats on Premium economy on line today on the dates I want despite the capacity block?? When pushed also said original flight was booked Premium Economy LITE and only FLEX is now available. Our only option is 1) Accept downgrade to economy for SIN>MEL leg with zero compensation on offer 2) obtain full refund for SIN>MEL leg leaving us stranded in Singapore on route to Melbourne 3) pay difference between premium economy lite and premium economy Flex I have escalated this twice but despite promising to call me back they do not or send an SMS for me to again call the SIA contact centre. Does any one have any suggestions. Should I contact ACCC in Australia or CCCS in Singapore?","negative"
"880","Terrible customer service 1. Customer service cannot handle simple itinerary changes. They are very polite but hardly trained. 2. Takes hours to correct the issue as they have to talk to supervisor for every simple thing and the supervisors are available depending on the call volume. I almost spent 5 hours. 3. I paid $1000 extra to prepone my start date and they cancelled my return ticket because my name was still left in original itinerary and marked as no show. 4. There is no tracking or notes for the calls, you have to start over with every call and explain the situation.","negative"

"7835","Consistently great service from Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines has been my preferred airline for the last twenty years during which I have travelled in Business, Premium Economy and Economy. They achieve a balance of affordability with excellent service no matter which class you travel. The service is always courteous and respectful. I've given 4 stars because, when travelling in Premium Economy, I felt that there should have been just a little more leg room (I'm 175 cm) and a little more reclining angle for the seats. That said, they are still my preferred airline.","positive"
"9908","best economy experience had a great flight for both sectors and after flying i can say that yes SQ is perhaps the best airlines in world, their economy class services were way better than any other say emirates, etihad, ethiopian, china southern etc. would always recommend SQ over any other airlines","positive"

"7240","Always a pleasure There’s something comforting about flying with Singapore Airlines. Sure, there are occasions when the service is not up to expectations. But that’s because expectations are sky-high all the time. It’s been a while since my last flight on SQ biz class and this trip was all the more pleasurable for it. Flight was on a Airbus380 with the upgraded cabin. Very nice! Cabin crew were fantastic. We pre-ordered Book a Chef meals which were great. One thing to take note though is the relatively small overhead luggage compartments on this aircraft type. Overall, a really great way to fly!","positive"
"5689","Great flight This is probably the best international flight we go on. It leaves late morning, arrives just before dinner time and the last time it only took 20 minutes to get from our seat to the taxi outside.

If you are heading out of NZ to Europe then I recommend this flight to Singapore as a stop over, you won't regret it.","positive"

"10507","Colombo to Sydney via Singapore. I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess in my cabin were pretty rude. It's like they just want to get their job done and they don't care about the people. I've travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely. They barely offer water to people. I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i can't. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn't on the menu. I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn't last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream! And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup). On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. I'd ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles.","neutral"
"893","Great flight marred by a pathetic on-ground experience at Changi Lounge : SilverKris Lounge , Terminal 3 Our incoming flight arrived at T1 , forcing us to take the overcrowded Skytrain to T3 ( as the only functional SilverKris Lounge is located there ). What a nightmare !! Just 2 coaches per train , filling up with hundreds of passengers at once , and people sneezing / coughing right on your face. Strange that the ""best airport in the world"" violates Covid-19 protocols of its own country. The lounge was as overcrowded as seen during our previous time here. Not even a single seat available. What is the point of a multi-million dollar renovation , if they could not even plan the seating correctly. This is the least they could have done , considering that every premium passenger flying on any Star Alliance flight can access this lounge. Boarding / Security : Our flight was assigned a gate at T1 ( as T3 conveniently shuts shop at night ). We left the lounge 1 HOUR EARLY. Our flight at 02:35 was the last SQ flight for the night. But even then , the lounge staff did not feel that it's their duty to inform us about the shocker that lay ahead. THE SKYTRAIN STOPS OPERATING AT 01:30. And still this airport wins awards all the time. Absurd. We had no option but to walk / run as fast as we could. It still took us almost 20 minutes to reach our gate. Security Check happens at the gate , one of the biggest flaws of this airport. But what makes it worse is the overtly rude security staff. A lady in front of us was having some trouble , but rather than being patient they started shouting at her for no reason at all. Passports / Boarding Passes are snatched out of your hands and thrown back at you. Also , a so-called ""5 star airline"" like SQ does not deserve that status , considering that they're unable to provide Fast-Track Immigration / Security at their own hub. Boarding was via a dedicated aerobridge. Seat / Layout : Just like their A350 , the B787-10 too has a 1-2-1 staggered layout in Business Class , with seats either close to the aisle or away ( the latter being more private ). The footrest is right in front , not angulated as seen on the A380 , ensuring a much better sleep. Service : Fabulous. Very courteous crew. Food & Beverages : We availed the 'Book the Cook' service. Loved Song Fa's 'Bak Kut Teh' and 'Qui Lian Ban Mian' Arrival : A dedicated Immigration counter for First / Business Class passengers. Luggage arrived on the belt on a priority basis as well.","neutral"

Better flying turkey or japan airlines.","negative"
"3624","Highly recommended Biggest priority, we are tall and were unable to get the exit seats, but even though our flight was sixteen hours plus, we were comfortable with enough leg space!! The staff was very friendly, professional and helpful to all passengers. The food was good and more than enough. Toilets always kept clean and stocked with supplies. They do however only provide on request a purse with eye patch, socks and toothbrush and paste. But the latter and combs were supplied in the toilets, watch out for that. Then I will recommend a long enough stop over in Singapore so that you can do the free city tour, or go on your own, everything is very user friendly, easy to draw money, buy Metro ticket etc.","positive"

Service as usual was excellent. Departure on time. Food could have been better but probably I made a wrong choice. The Indian meal I requested was not spicy enough. Immediately after my meal the cabin attendant converted my seat into a flat bed with bed cover a mattress and a warm blanket. Got to sleep for 3 hours. The extra money spent was worth every penny. Looking forward to my return journey on March 17 using the same aircraft from Singapore to Mumbai","positive"
"1986","An old airplane It appears that airlines flying into places like Ahmedabad in India seem to take the passengers for granted and provide sub standard service. People dont complain. On a recent flight Singapore Air deployed a Airbus that seemed ready for the graveyard. The food was so so and the only scotch on the plane was Johnny Walker Red Label( not a particularly palatable one. Other airlines have done the same. For the fare they charge lt might be a good idea to take a low cost airline","negative"
"10704","Manila to Munich via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has always lived up to its name and quest for excellence.

"11433","Dubai-Singapore-Perth. Very disappointing. What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly entertainment screen was tiny dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970’s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlins these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.","negative"

Singapore lounge in Terminal 2 so so, and looks more like a canteen. SIN to DEL red eye operated by a Boeing 777-200 which was refitted. Packed flight and crew not as good. Food and IFE average.

Make sure you do not travel with this airline if your passport expiration date is near. I had 13 days left until passport expiration date ends and they not supposed to sell me the flight but they did. On top they did not check that I had less days left, and let me on the flight. Terribile check in service, what are they stupid enough to not check my passport and let me fly to Germany. I went to Germany and when I arrived, the federal police came and brought me to the police station because my passport date was going to end. Because of the airline not checking and warning me I waited at the police station for about 7 or 8 hours. And the trip got canceled and I had to pay for my flight back! This is unfair they were supposed to send me back not make me pay another $850 dollars! I want my money back!

"3164","Best Airline 2018 I flew round trip from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Zurich, Switzerland because I got a good promo deal. I was so impressed that this year I decided to fly to Italy again on SIA. It was a bit pricey (compared with a few other airlines) because I went during peak and also it was a weekend flight. It was worth it! Flight schedule suited me. I flew to Milan first, then went to Florence and Venice by trains. Embarked on a cruise from Venice which ended in Rome. Flew out of Italy from Rome. Even though I flew economy class, the seats were wide enough and spacious leg room. Service was good. There is an ""in between meals"" snack menu so I was never hungry. Anytime throughout the flight, you can ask for sandwiches, biscuits, nuts, chips, apples or instant noodles.","positive"

I wasn’t entirely impressed with the entertainment offered on the plane. The movies were old, not new releases. What happened to the airlines playing new releases like in the late 90s and 2000?","positive"
"74","Most uncomfortable flight experience My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. You can’t trust an airline company that lies like this. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But I still haven’t heard from them. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty.","negative"

"960","Once a great airlines, now its a pity to travel in Singapore Air I travelled from Bombay to Singapore on 16th June and then returned on 27th June. The standards of the Service and food are deteriorating day by day. What I observed that they are doing their 'allotted job' nicely but if you want them to come in-between, their Service becomes poor. They do their normal job well but are in so much hurry to 'complete' it that they forget special requests( like extra quilt/pillow/hot water to drink etc). One has to remind them repeatedly. This wasn't the case earlier. I have now decided to try other alternate airlines. Even my children staying in Singapore have same opinion. I will encourage others to try them for other than routine services and give their ratings/reviews.","neutral"

"9670","Save for Business Class if you can. Absolute heaven. After flying Singapore to Paris in Economy, the sheer luxury of the extra space in Business Class was pronounced. After spending a few complimentary hours in the Singapore Kris Lounge at Heathrow, we were delivered to our boarding gate by buggy and ushered immediately to our seats (more like mini cabins). Champagne & orange juice were available, with drink order for after takeoff taken. Just playing with all of the buttons and gadgets was fun, finding noise-cancelling headphones, a pack of slippers, socks, eyeshades and toothbrush, and a larger screen for watching the inflight entertainment. The best bit, however, is the massive amount of room. No fighting with your neighbour for elbow room, no lack of room for your legs, and of course the whole 'pod' converts to a fully flat bed for a much better chance of sleep. Cushioning in the bed position is rather thin, but better than sitting up for 13 hours. Dinner was served on real plates with real cutlery and glasses and never seemed to stop coming, with each course served individually, not all at once on one tray as happens in economy. Service is provided quietly & competently, with ready assistance to set up the bed. The cabin staff even use your name! Longhaul flights are not fun, but business class makes the experience more enjoyable. We wer not looking forward to the next leg, Singapore to Brisbane, in economy.","positive"

I would like to congratulate the Singapore Airlines team and SYD Airport for having such an amazing team member. Please congratulate Linda and thank her for us. She definitely went Above and beyond for this elderly lady. You made her day. Singapore Airlines definitely delivered. World Class.","positive"

"2418","Good experience Check in was fast and friendly. That left us some time to explore the shops at Narita airport. Cabin crew was attentive and polite, and the food quite good. There was a good selection of movies to keep us occupied, and pretty soon, after a six-hour flight we were collecting our luggage and clearing immigration.","positive"
"3801","Best flying experience Excellent and friendly service. Paid for extra legroom for 6ft4 husband - worth it for long flight. Only problem on way out was that these seats were near the loos and entrance to staff rest area so disturbed by constant lights switching on and off. On return there was a curtain, which was better, and I requested a sleep mask, which did the trick.","positive"
"10431","Makassar to Singapore. It took more time to Check-in since there’s Coronavirus concern in Singapore and they check our passport per pages because we are not allowed to visit or even transit In Singapore if you ever visit China in 14 Days, A little delay for boarding. The flight attendant is nice, the in-flight meal taste great. Singapore - Bangkok: First time using A350-900 and I like it, the aircraft still new and so fresh, The In-flight meal is good. Boarding time is great, on time.","positive"

I have never seen such a big seat... not even in the first class in Emirates. I can fit 4x times in this seat! :-D About the service.... no words needed! 10 from 10.

Seats hardish, just a bit wider & noise cancelling earphones supplied [though mine was broken when I unwrapped it,] Armrests brick-hard [pins & needles in fingers after 10 mins.] Cabin staff very good and food excellent [apart from rotten apple on outward trip.] Toilet facilities very poor- only 1 toilet each side for Premium Economy & front cabin regular economy . Meant long queues all the time,esp after breakfast when some passengers, despite all the desperate folks behind, took an unreasonable time in there changing clothes & having a wash. Waste bins overflowing 2/3 of the way thru trip.","neutral"
"1496","Very efficient and high touch experience We flew Singapore Airlines on SIN-HAN-SIN round-trip (SQ176 on Oct 25, 2019 and SQ175 on Nov 5, 2019). It was a pleasant experience. The whole process from check-in, to baggage transfers to final delivery of baggage were timely. The flights themselves were timely as well. We were given hot towels soon after boarding. Our pre-ordered special request vegetarian meals were served fresh and hot. The leg room was very good, and the seats were comfortable. In-flight service was top notch. Nothing else that we could ask for from an airline! Singapore Airlines has always been one of our preferred airline while booking our trips, and will continue to do so after our recent experience. Keep up the good work, team at Singapore Airlines!","positive"

"1745","Singapore airlines is very good On February 22, 2020 we flew from Hanoi to Singapore and from Singapore to Amsterdam with Singapore airlines. Nothing great can be said on Singapore airlines. They fly with good equipment. Good pilots (4 flights). The staff is nice, very friendly and willing to help. The TV screen is, considering the economy class, fine, with a very extensive choice. The food is excellent. There is a disadvantage. At the back of the plane there is a chance that you cannot get the meal you were hoping for. With a lot of demand from the predecessors there is a considerable chance that you have to choose something else. The space between the front seats is considerable compared to other airlines. The width of the seats is reasonable for a normal posture.","positive"
"4317","Journey to Southeast Asia I have heard a lot of positive things about Singapore Airlines, with regard to how highly rated the air carrier is, over the years. I can see why, and what all the praise is all about. Check-in was pretty quick, in spite of being a party of seven people. Service onboard was good, as was the in-flight entertainment. All-round, it was an enjoyable journey. My only criticisms would be that seat comfort was average and legroom was a bit tight, even for an aisle seat, but that's something I experience quite frequently, whenever I travel by air. I also found that the food wasn't all that appealing as far as flavor goes, but props to them, for recognizing how taste is affected by air travel, and crafting the food to seal in flavor, for when it's served mid-fight. In all, I like Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"6461","An airlines that never dissapoint us Nice food served, air crew very accomodative, asked for extra coke and pepsi for collections. And thet gave me extra peanuts too.. i just love the peanuts, thanks guys","positive"
"3417","Still the best Singapore Airline is still the best airline, although not quite as good as a year ago.. Using Premium Economy provides a much easier overall flight experience, from priority check-in and baggage handling, to slightly extra personal space in the seat (which makes all the difference) and priority meal service.On this particular flight we found the cabin crew service very slightly disjointed and it struck us the cabin crew had not yet melded into a top team. However, overall the experience was that Singapore Airlines still provides a relaxing flight so sit back and enjoy!","positive"
"657","Horrible, Never flying with Singapore Air Lines again When you pay extra to fly Business Class, you expect more than a horrible curry. I asked for some crackers/biscuits as I did not want to eat curry, They refused to provide anything other than the meal they said is available. I am a frequent traveler and no air line has ever refused to provide me a light snack/crackers in lieu of a main meal. Secondly the toilets were a mess. And to top it all, their baggage handlers ripped open my bag and helped themselves to some valuables. Compensation offered by Singapore Airlines does not even pay for a pair of socks! I now fly with Emirates - what a wonderful Airline Emirates is...... there's a variety of food, something for everyone. Service is wonderful and the toilets get cleaned on a regular basis. SINGAPORE AIRLINES...... WHAT A HORRIBLE WAY TO FLY.","negative"
"7566","Excellent Excellent service all the way, picked up associate airline Silk in Singapore for onward carriage to Siem Reap. Quite a bit of rain so some minor, less than thirty minute, delays. I got to Siem Reap, but my luggage didn't. Filled in some forms and told should be delivered to my hotel by 11:00am maybe 2:00pm next day. 1:00pm, knock at the door: luggage. And the courier informed me that was entitled to $100US for my inconvenience. Paid in cash, on the spot. It was no big deal for me, but travelling with kids, moving on the next day? That all our corporate citizens took their responsibilities so seriously. Putting a set of clean jocks a tshirt and toothbrush in my hand luggage from now on.","positive"
"5992","The best...as always 14 hours on a plane is not something to look forward to. Though rarely flying that way, Singapore Airlines has always been our only carrier. From stepping across the threshold into the plane, one is pampered..even in Economy. The attendants are so wonderful, always smiling and glide around like the Ballet Rambert. The meals were great..mild S Easter Asian food. Drinks are free with meals, and every 20 minutes ir so they came around with water/ orange juice. The video/ audio system is of a very high quality and 4 films later we were landing in Singapore. The return flight was equally pleasant.","positive"
"10273","I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.","negative"
"6416","Wonderful Flight Experience My wife and I flew Singapore Airlines from the U.S.A. all the way to Thailand - a total of 19 hours of flying - and we couldn't have chosen better! The seats are comfortable, the attendants are excellent, the in-flight entertainment options are plentiful, and the baggage check was a breeze. During one part of our trip, we were running extremely late to the airport. Singapore Airlines helped us rush through security and check-in to make our flight in 20 minutes! They truly care about customer service and we look forward to flying with them again soon.","positive"

"7244","Long, dark and depressing flight Having flown in business class on the outbound trip, we returned but used Premium Economy. Seats were generally ok as was the general service. As we left Singapore at 2.30am it meant we were flying mostly at night. The flight was about 14 hours long, which we knew and had prepared for. What we did not prepare for was the depressing feeling of the flight as the cabin was ‘dark’ for 12 of those hours. I do not understand why, after 8 hours of fight, the cabin could not be illuminated. Yes, I know you have your own reading lights but it’s not the same. The flight attendants were very good and kept you supplied with water, juice and apples but you just kept looking at the time and thinking how much better it would be if it was lighter. No doubt Singapore Airlines are very good but I am glad we were not in Economy!","positive"

"10463","San Francisco to Kolkata via Singapore. On my SFO-SIN flight I asked for an extra bread roll/butter at one of the meal times, was given the bread but told ‘sorry, it’s one butter per passenger/tray’!. Then I asked for Chinese tea (instead of what they were taking around) - and was told ‘we don’t have any’. At SFO check-in counter, I stood at the head of the Premium Economy line for 15min as passengers who had come after me were attended to before me. After 3 such times, when I expressed surprise, a lady said I was in the wrong queue for bag drop. I pointed out to her I was not standing for bag drop but check in, after which I was attended to. This was the first time ever that my SQ experience left a bad taste in my mouth, especially given how wonderful it always is, and how warmly I recommend it to everyone specifically for its customer service. It would be very unfortunate if the airline cannot keep up its usual standards.","negative"

"3127","Disappointed Did the same flight with Singapore Airlines 12 mths ago and could not fault the service. This trip I was more than disappointed. Seat selection cost almost $200 over two flights. My partner is quite tall and there is no automatic allowances for people who NEED the leg room. Annoying to see short people in the extra spacious seating. The meals/snacks combinations were odd. For example: A bread roll,jam, muffin and some fruit for breakfast. Sleep was impossible as the seating room was squeezy, and I'm of average size. The person in the seat in front had their chair right back, even on take off, so my screen was in my face which forced me to put my chair back. Based on my previous flight I had highly recommended Singapore Airlines but will most likely not going forward.","neutral"
"2364","Too cramped On the flight to Singapore from Adelaide we had more leg room. The return flight we felt like sardines. Even had to sit with legs in the aisle as they couldn't fit in the seating area. Very bad for everyone's health. Have travelled with Singapore for years but this was the worst flight ever. New seats in plane - terrible for an overnight flight. Rethinking our airline for next trip.","neutral"

"8911","Sydney - Singapore - Amsterdam Premium economy from Sydney to Singapore was well worth the extra money. The seats and leg room were very comfortable. The TV screens are larger and the offer headphones which alleviate plane noise. The food was OK and it was good to be able to order before hand. The change over at Singapore Changi airport is one of the easiest I have experienced. No need to go through a transfer station. I went economy from Singapore to Amsterdam and really wished I could be back in Premium. But on the whole I always enjoy travelling with Singapore airlines as the service is always great. Wish I could say the same about the food. But when is plane food exceptional anyway.","positive"
"3360","Not sure if convenience beats timing With Canberra only served by Singapore and Qatar Airlines, we opted for the Canberra to Tokyo out and Osaka to Canberra back flights on Singapore. The latter meant flying out of Osaka close to midnight for a relatively short trip to Singapore where we arrived just after 4am. Then a long wait, albeit in the Business lounge, for our 10:30am flight to Canberra via Sydney and a hour transit in Sydney. Accordingly it took just on 22 hours from leaving Osaka till we arrived in Canberra and we started to question whether the benefits of 15 minutes to get through customs, luggage arrival and quarantine were worth the long trip. Singapore Business Class was delightful, the service was superb, the beds were great, the food and wine was excellent and we could not fault the flight except for the pretty ordinary selection of recent movies. Our outbound and inbound flights both occurred in September, further exacerbating the problem of minimal choice of movies to watch. We could have departed from and returned to Sydney and the timing would have been much more convenient but we're not sure after talking to fellowAustralian travellers we toured with whether we would have enjoyed the flights with other airlines. So in this case we think that we made the right choice.","positive"
"7983","First class service Yet another first class service from SQ. The whole process from baggage drop off, check-in to alighting in BKK to baggage collection in BKK was smooth. The flight departed on time, arrived in BKK ahead of schedule. Crew were very good and all well looked after. One disappointment was that at the time of booking the aircraft was B787-900 which was later changed to A330-300. Except that everything else was pleasant.","positive"

"2885","Poor Service! I decided to fly with Singapore airlines on my return trip from Fiji to Singapore Via Sydney with Singapore Airlines, i had a business class reservation. I choose Singapore airlines as i had used this airline in the same route in the past and was very impressed with the service and the comfort level, however this time my experience was a bit disappointing. I boarded the flight on 9th November, it was a day time flight took off from Sydney at 9 am, when i got to my seat i felt the seat was not cleaned, no headphones, no amenity kit, overall the seat arrangement looked messy. This is not expected from a five star premium airline, I requested for a headphone and amenity bag and they informed me the amenity bag is on request on this flight which i felt very is very wired. even the worst business class airline would provide you with a amenity kit which is basic. they the attendant comes to me with pair of bathroom slippers which is apparently the Singapore airlines amenity kit!!!! i gave up and didn't bother to follow up, many of the flight attendants looked tired as if they had overworked and it just felt like they wanted to somehow finish the service and get it done with. Then came the duty free sales, i wanted to buy a miniature of Singapore airlines for my son, which i asked the attendant (First class cabin attendant) she said she don't have it with her , she will check with her colleague and come back to me. i didn't get any feedback for then next two hours of the flight, then she turns up and says she don't have it after two hours of the flight!! is this what you call an award winning service? OK i could also put up with that, the worst disappointment came when i used the wash rooms in the flight, it was disgustingly unclean!! i used the washroom almost three times during the flight it was the same condition on the entire flight....This was my overall experience on this flight. I wrote this review as its important for your airline to have quality checks to ensure you have a consistent service delivery in your aircraft's, i choose Singapore airlines over any other airline due to my past outstanding experiences with the airline. i really hope you take this review seriously and correct these negative customer experiences.

"9671","The long haul from Heathrow to Sydney No one enjoys 24 hours flying from the UK to Sydney but the Singapore air crew made it as pleasant as possible with friendly service and regular cups of water. Food was reasonable and the new A380 has a bit more legroom which makes a noticeable difference. A few hours sleep does not prevent jet lag, but helps make you less grumpy.","positive"

"2090","Good flight great service! Singapore Airlines is my airline of choice for long-haul flights to Asia. The service is unbeatable and is worth the occasional extra $$ when compared with other airlines. The stewards and stewardess are always friendly and accommodating. I have never had to ask anyone for help to put my bags up on the overhead compartment on SQ, but on an occasion have had to bear through grimace with some unnamed American airlines. Inflight entertainment is awesome but meals on this flight can be improved as I have had better quality food on long hauls from SF or LA to Asia. Must agree, a little expensive compared to other airlines I've tried, but I rather pay more for a little more comfort through a long journey.","positive"

"6400","One of the best airlines Pros: Modern Boeing aircraft. Comfortable seats. Nice meals. The head Steward even knew my wife’s and my surname as well as that of my two daughters. Clean toilets. Aircraft on time. Pilot communicative with passengers. Good in-flight entertainment with touch viewing screens. I was given an eye mask on request. Very modern terminal in Singapore with a great selection of food and drink. Online check-in available which makes check in at the airport smooth and relatively fast. Cons: The option of checking in online, in Phuket, Thailand (the beginning of our trip to Australia), was sent by email and the check in process was partly in the Thai language. On my phone I did not see an option to create all writing into the English language. – I may have missed this. Singapore airlines is one of the most comfortable and efficient airlines to travel with.","positive"

The plane leaves SG just before midnight and arrives in AMS around 6.15am - so even a 12 hour flight seems like no time is wasted. Wifi is available on board but requires payment. The complimentary allowance for business class members is only suited for text messages - runs out fast. Overall, a very comfortable flight. Will definitely fly again.","positive"

Wifi was good when available - the 30MB gets chewed up very quickly! Nevertheless, this is a fantastic airline and we will definitely fly again as our airline of choice.","positive"
"5374","an oK first time experience with Singapore Airlines It was our first time flying with Singapore airlines to Denpasar,Bali via Singapore. We used to fly with another airlines but decide to give The Singapore airlines a try. On the first leg of our flight we flew with SQ 0025 originaly from JFK to Sin via FRA. Our aircraft was A380 and as ussual when we flew A380 we choose to sit in the last row of economy classs we can board the aircraft first. We choose the 60-s row. Our flight was delayed for several minutes not sure for what reasons. The configuration of the A380 SQ is a bit different with other airliens that we ever flew with which was their toilet on back of economy class onlw 2 availables which I find a bit annoying as we always have to stay in line for toilet, compare to other airlines which have at least 4 toilets. The leg room was ok, the Entertainment options on board is ok, but for me personally I would rather have the A380 aircraft that has outside camera view and pilot view on flying routes as in other airlines, which in this SQ 25 A380 not available. The meals was ok, but could be better. The cabin crew friendlieness was not was we expected, knowing Singapore airlines in past years often got an awards for best cabin crew, unfortunately only one or two of the cabin crew esp. in our class that show that genuinely friendliness. However, the flight was smooth, we arrive a tiny bit late from schedule but we are be able to catch our SQ 938 flight to Bali. On our second leg flight to Bali with SQ 939, personally i found it much better, with A330 in economy class, the legroom quite big, we choose the 2 seater seat, which is I recomennded for couple, and hope that the longhaul flight has also the 2 seater seat. The cabin crew in SQ 938 was friendly and helpfull, not quite sure if its because it was only a short flight that affecting the mood of cabin crew but it was better than the our first leg flight. The meals was ok, we've got our brunch and coffee which can be ask to refill. Overall our first experience flying with Singapore Airlines was ok, tho we expecting it to be more than just ok.","positive"
"6765","Very comfortable long-haul flight Another great flight with Singapore Airlines. Check-in at Heathrow was uneventful, the flight left on time. I find that the space (for my modest frame at least!) is fine even for long haul. The cabin crew are always smart, polite and attentive and on-board catering is very acceptable.","positive"

"7589","SQ's Dreamliner and latest Economy cabin literally made me smile throughout the flight All along, my main gripe about SQ's Economy class cabin are the seats and even the tray height. For me, SQ's Economy class seats gave very little legroom space. A recent revised cabin design also ended up with dining trays mounted quite low such that it sat on my laps. Very uncomfortable. It was SQ's good services, cabin entertainment system and food that compensated for the uncomfortable seats. Well, good news! I took a return flight in November/December 2018 between Singapore and Nagoya. Both flights used Dreamliners with the new cabin design. They rectified my main grouses! Much more leg room now and dining tray is of the right height. If there could be one slight improvement, I would like a deeper seat to better support the undersides of the thighs. The entertainment system is also new and the food menu seemed to have improved too. On my return trip, although the number of meals served was reduced from two to one, that one meal was really tasty so much so that my son and I wished we could ask for a second serving. Overall, I really enjoyed this new cabin - I smiled throughout both flights. As a matter of fact, I'm itching to try the new cabins for Premium Economy and maybe Business.","positive"

"1129","Poor Customer Service. Pure awful and with no class. Huge disappointment I flew business class on the SQ23 from NYC to Singapore on Jan 4th. The flight was OK. Singapore air are cheap on wifi offering in business class. They need to learn from KLM/Delta/AirFrance classic hospitality. As for food options, not impressed. They don't offer salads and healthy snacks. They are too fixated on offering large variety of alcohol liquors. Again, they need to benchmark SKY TEAM for first class hospitality !!! The nightmare started when I landed in Singapore. Upon arrival, my luggage did not arrive with me. Upon checking with customer service at the airport, they indicated my luggage was not loaded on the plane in NYC. They said, my luggage was forwarded to LA for next day delivery to Singapore - RED FLAG1. WHY would sing air send it to LA when another flight from NYC will be departing the following day ??. For next 8 days, I daily called the airline to find out the status. Please note, I was calling. No one from sing air called me!. I kept getting the same scripted answer. We are searching for your luggage. Finally, on day #9 my luggage arrived. My suite case was filthy and destroyed. It is like someone dragged along the runway for a long time. The fabric was ripped in 5 spots. Arm handle was broken. When I opened it, beside spoiled goods, I discovered several stolen xmas gift items. I submitted a claim on Jan 14th for spoiled and stolen goods. Till now, March 5th, I am still chasing Singapore airline for compensation with no light at the end of the tunnel. To add insult to injury. Singapore airline, reached out to me regarding the damaged suite case. They said, my 27 inch Samsonite is a fake one - RED FLAG2. Please note, I bought it from Macy's in the USA 20 months ago and only used it 3 times. I replied to Singapore airline and indicated there must be miss understanding. This is genuine. But, they insisted it is a fake Samsonite. I finally gave up and asked them to replace it with identical Fake one - they can buy it from Macy's online. They said NO. They will either give me 180 SGD or American Tourister brand as a replacement. Key takeaway from all of this. Singapore Airline is a fake façade of customer focus and service. Next time I will go back to fly SKY Team (KLM/ Delta / Air France). They are first class airline with genuine customer service focus. BTW, I have never ever had this type of experience with them.","negative"

"8882","Feeling at home Over the last few months, I have been flying on the OneWorld Alliance network to Europe and East Asia purely on cost effectiveness basis. For this trip to London in the last week of September 2018, I decided to go with Singapore Airlines. There is a world of difference in the level of service. I take this down mainly to familiarity brought about by the highly personalised level of service and the quality of the food served. First - the crew were exceptional. They were very professional and yet very personalised in their service - attentive to our needs and ensuring that we were all well taken care of. In particular, the crew in our cabin, namely Syamsiah, Khai Lee, Eu Jia and Uma. They made us feel at home and comfortable. For a 13 hour flight - that makes a huge difference. Second - the quality of the food served was very high. I had a fave of mine - Nasi Lemak - as my Muslim meal choice. It was tasty and perhaps I dare to say even better than some I have tasted at the hawker stalls in Singapore. Overall, the experience was a very welcoming one. Although I had to pay almost the equivalent for a business class seat on a OneWorld alliance flight, the Premium Economy service and seats were excellent.","positive"

"4485","Nothing special When checking in for our flight the agent wanted us to check our hang-up bag. After some pleading they let us take it to the gate and said it might have to be gate checked. Never had this issue with United Airlines. There was no pre-ck line at the airport even though it’s marked on the boarding pass. The airline makes no effort to work with airport authorities on providing special handling of business class passengers. For the flight itself we were not impressed. Asked for 2 different wines that were on the menu and they said they did not have them. When we travel business class on other airlines I’ve never arrived hungry. We did with Singapore Airlines. You have to ask for any food or drinks on the second half of the 16 hr. flight. When we host a party our guess don’t have to ask for there needs. Didn’t feel like Singapore Airlines are good hosts. When using lavatories we had to wait. When we arrived in Singapore our bags were the last to come out even though our bags had priority tags. When we left the airport we looked at each other and both thought how could Singapore Airlines be voted the world’s best airline. 🤷 ♂️","negative"
"1515","Rip Off Pay 3 times more for Less. We are in Rome organising to return shortly to Australia. We have 2 choices - to spend the remaining 2 of weeks in Rome or go to Germany for 2 weeks. So I did some research on airfares. Checked online with Singapore Airlines: Rome - Frankfurt - Singapore 945.00 Euro Frankfurt - Singapore 2700 Euro. That cannot be right!! 3 times more for less??!! The Frankfurt - Singapore was the same flight on the same day in both examples - 26 March flight SQ325, so I rang Singapore Airlines. After much discussion with the operator without a suitable explanation, other than ""that is what is in the system"", I asked to speak to a supervisor as it didn't make sense. The supervisor said the pricing was correct as they have different pricing schedules for different markets. Italians wont pay as much as the Germans. I said ""Can I buy a Rome - Frankfurt - Singapore ticket and only use the Frankfurt - Singapore leg?"" No! the ticket is void if I don't get on in Rome. Checked with Lufthansa (Germany's own airline) and the same result. Talk about ripping off your customers!! We have now booked with another carrier as we cannot trust Singapore or Lufthansa - how can we trust the other carrier?? - ignorance is bliss.","negative"

The first part of this flight from London was freezing - and I know planes are cold so had on several layers but this was uncomfortable. Then Singapore to Perth was so warm I had to strip down and was still not comfortable. But otherwise the flight was great (well as good as a long uncomfortable flight can be), service is always with a smile and everything went according to plan.","positive"
"11238","Lounge in Brisbane had been ""refreshed"" since my last visit and looked more pleasant. Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures. On balance this was my choice to India as Qantas/ Emirates were via Dubai or on a 737 on Jet Airways via Singapore or Air India via Sydney. SG thus offer a good connection and better service than Air India but the flights were not anything special.","negative"

"10326","Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its „upgraded“ new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service.","negative"

"1260","Singapore Airlines 787-10 economy the Singapore Airlines 787-10 economy is modern quiet comfortable aircraft with only 2 classes. Business and economy. On this trip I flew economy and the cabin is in a 3-3-3 layout 2 isle layout. Being a Gold member with an affiliate airline I was able to use the business check in and I had priority boarding. The economy seats are designed by RECARO and have a six-way adjustable headrest with adjustable wings to provide more neck support. However teh seats themselves are a tad narrower than the same design which you will find on the A350-900 and the newer A380's. Power sockets can also be found in-between the seats, and in the back of the seat in front of you there is also a folding table a new updated IFE system and a USB port and a cup holder for your drinks. The aircraft a modern and the Dreamliner offers a very quiet inflight experience and Singapore Airlines as usual offer very good in flight cabin service. I would recommend their economy product as its comfortable and clean and it was an enjoyable experience Singapore Airlines has switched to the earbuds instead of those crappy sounding over-ear headphones.","positive"

It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers (salmons & prawns) were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have, I’ve chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years. Not the cabin crew’s fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful.

Seating, legroom, comfort level was excellent with a 3-3-3 config on the A350. I had booked 2 aisle seats online but they ended up as one aisle & one middle ? Very smooth flight except for bouts of turbulence when the trolleys appeared, as usual! Following comments, # starting in the airport itself; confirmed on line & T3 self check in was very smooth with gate C1 shown from T3 on the boarding pass. However, after several enquiries we were told to go to T1 where there is a Gate C1. Not knowing how many Gate C1s there are in this airtropolis we checked again to be told this C1 is in both T1 & T3 ?? # duty free promo requires actual goods invoice to participate when it is in the special bags you only receive at the gate ?? So much for a new Jag ! # meal service was excellent, tasty Nasi Goreng, described as fried rice ?, along with wine etc. # refreshment before landing was appalling, supposed to be a mini chicken & a mini tuna pie/puff. Definitely indigestion inducing, one was incredibly sweet ??, do not know which was which, just took one bite of each & left the rest. Packaging full of blurb about the design, no nutritional analysis, wisely as full of fat/carbs, no best by date, # on finals cabin lights dimmed but not the grating incessant piano ""music"" which was way too loud, shoot the piano player anyone? # finally, it never ceases to amaze me that after a 7-8 hour flight you have to stack over Warwick, did we just pop up on the radar over Gympie ? Such inefficient airports are exacerbating climate change not to mention losing time & costing $ for extra fuel. When will they get their act together.

The flight attendant realised this and immediately suggested to me that there are some empty seats that I could make myself more comfortable.

"6163","9 years of flying with Singapore Airlines We have an annual trip to Perth Australia and having in the early years tried other Airlines, we now only use Singapore Airlines. The seating in Economy is very generous and comfortable even after 12 hours. The plane is always kept tidy and clean thanks to the deligence of the cabin crew. The food is good with a selection of European and Asian dishes and of course you can choose a dietary need when booking your flight. Wine, beer and spirits is offered as well as soft drinks. This year we did notice that they were not quite so generous as previously. We felt this was a sign of Singapore’s financial situation, never the less if you asked for more it was given without hesitation. Water and juice is regularly bought around to keep you hydrated, which is very important. Checking in process is efficient and as with all of the Singapore Airlines staff are pleasant and helpful. For parents with babies the cabin crew do what they can to help make things easier. Staggered meal times so you both get a hot meal and the heating of bottle or food pouches or jars. The toilet facilities on the plane are spacious and well supplied and maintained. The in flight entertainment is the best that I have come across. Plenty of new release films as well as the old goodies. The music selection I felt was not so good as before, it seemed more limited. One thing that I felt was missing was audio books. These have been deleted from the package. The price structure of Singapore Airlines is good, they are in line with Emirates but cheaper than Virgin, BA and Quantus.","positive"
"274","Two excellent flights this time! My previous experience three weeks earlier was a little bit disappointing (BOM-SIN-BKK), however, there were two excellent flights this time: SQ707 BKK-SIN on 26 July and SIN-BOM 31 July. The crew on the SQ707 on 26 July were exceptional (IFM Geradine, LSS Jane, FSS Gift, FSS Moon & FS Arif), wanted to get their names since great and dedicated work must be recognized. As already said, superb crews on both flights, excellent lunch/dinner, and flights on-time. The only gripe is that I don't seem to get a comfortable position on the B777-300ER: the angled position is quite awkward and my back hurts after two hours - prefer the A350 over the B777-300ER. This, of course, is a matter of personal taste only.","positive"
"11125","Flew economy on Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return this week. By chance, both flights used the new A350-900 fleet. For such short route, I guess it's partly to test the new planes. Not too bad an experience on the new planes. Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class. Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so it's not a coincidence). Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments. Other than the beautiful outlook and smooth cruise in the air, the interior comfort falls short of expectations.","positive"

The food was very good to exceptional (inflight meals as well as oriental vego and seafood options). Very generous with drinks. Inflight entertainment was okay and better than past experience. Economy seats are getting smaller (is that possible?). We were fortunate to be surrounded by very considerate passengers who only partially inclined their seats so the longest leg (5 1/2 hours) was comfortable enough. Check in and boarding at Hanoi end was a bit chaotic. Our only complaint is the ground staff when departing Perth who didn't know the rules for carrying liquids in hand luggage and insisted we check a bag in. She was adamant that she was right and refused to check for us. We didn't hold our ground because we didn't want to hold up other passengers.

"6529","Great Service I’ve finally gotten the chance to try Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines use terminal 3 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. After checking in and passing through immigration, you can go to the lounge on the 3rd floor. It was quiet when I went there. Maybe because I had an early flight. The gate was close to the lounge. For this particular flight, we had a B787 “Dreamliner”. The business class seats were arranged in a 1-2-1 layout (aisle access for all seats). Seats were nice and spacious. Flat bed! Charging docks for your electronic devices. Big TV (touch) screen with a remote control. Food and service were good. The flight from Manila to Singapore was quick (3 hours).","positive"
"10849","Singapore to San Francisco via Hong Kong. Worst flight ever. I paid for an extra legroom seat 41c. This seat is supposedly bulkhead but it isn't. This is an isle seat which has the isle for the cabin directly in front of it. This means that the food trolley has to make a 45 degree turn into your cabin thereby making you move or be hit by the trolley every time. In fact they slammed the trolley into the arm of my chair every pass. You can only sleep if you encroach into the middle seat and cross your legs which we all know is a health hazard. The crew just grinned each time I was jarred awake. Only once did they say sorry. I complained and the airline said sorry it hasn't been an issue before. Most airline these days have a good movie selection, not this one. Food was awful. Glad we had our own water as they hardly bring any around. I know this is a long flight but the crew were terrible.","negative"
"7802","A very comfortable flight We flew premium economy for the first time and although pricy found the comfort on the long flight worth it. I am quite tall and found the extra leg room allowed me to sleep far longer than previously. We felt Singapore Airline staff were most attentive and helped us to enjoy our long flight . We were sorry that the chrisflyer points get cancelled after 3 years making it difficult for us to save enough points to make their use worthwhile.","positive"

"6364","The worlds best The cabin staff are excellent, they constantly bring water,orange juice around, nothing is too much trouble. The seats are more spacious and you don’t feel cramped. The food is very good and the assortment on your tray, there is something for everyone. I had a very good diabetes meal, with plenty to eat. In all, we had an excellent return trip. The check ins are excellent too and very easy.","positive"
"10649","Singapore Airlines has impressed me on the Singapore-Sydney route for the first time. It is evident that the morning flights are much better than the night time flights. As SQ 211 departed, a great lunch was served followed by multiple drink rounds before a mini pizza prior to landing, which compares well against the red eye SQ221 and 231. The staff were quite courteous with the exception of one cabin crew member, the rest were extremely pleasant. Specially the leading crew in charge was particularly friendly. Flight landed ahead of schedule and all in all, I couldn't fault the service.","positive"
"11660","MEL-SIN return. Usually travel Business Class but tried Economy on this short trip. Overall impression was pretty good. Both flights were almost full but the crews were friendly and helpful and food service was quite slow but quality of the food was reasonable. Had a strange experience with the inflight entertainment system on both flights an English Language film suddenly lapsed into a version dubbed into some oriental language. Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick. Unable to check-in online for return trip due to more website problems but the standard check-in system at Changi was just excellent. Better than some Business Class check-in processes in fact.","positive"
"10365","After spending a little more on the flight than intended after flying on this return journey with Singapore was happy I did as the overall experience was second to none. The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff. Boarding the plane I immediately became aware of the ""Singapore girl"" exceptional customer service the airline is known for. The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved. I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other ""Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h"". When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said ""Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor"" Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again. Hopefully to try out their world class business class.","positive"
"545","Fantastic! Cabin crew were brilliant To start with the usual bits, nice comfy seats, decent leg room for economy, good entertainment (plenty to occupy you for weeks rather than hours) and the food was good. The real wow factor was from our cabin crew: (we got names) Luqman, Eonji, Johaniy, you were brilliant. Liq overheard me make a comment to my wife as we were seating about it being our honeymoon and that was it. We were treated like royalty the entire flight. Lee kept topping us up with complimentary champagne and gave us any extra freebee bits he could get his hands on. The entire crew were attentive the entire flight without being too much. Really friendly, polite and generally very nice people. And although we got the extra bits we saw them looking after every passenger the same way. Amazing airline and amazing service. Thank you, you got our amazing honeymoon off to the perfect start","positive"
"2945","Absolutely Outstanding Service & Quality Generally, living in Dubai, I tend to fly Emirates a lot, this was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines and if I can I will not fly a different airline ever again! Granted, I was in Business class so of course that is generally good, but this was by far the best flight I have ever taken! The seats are spacious and comfy, the food was wonderful, the selection of tv entertainment, games and music was awesome but the most incredible thing I would like to mention is about the CREW MEMBERS! Oh they were so fantastic, friendly, attentive, smart, eloquent, polite, helpful, professional but also fun! I had such an amazing flight! We were just treated with such care and attention it was incredible. Amongst those I would like to personally thank from the bottom of my heart are; FSS Shanelle Lo (ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL WOW!) FSS Yong Wen Xin CSS Winnie Teng FS Ho Jin WAI FSS Tan Qui Li FSS Sheera I hope that by writing this they all get the recognition and praise that they deserve, absolutely 10/10. I can not wait to fly with Singapore airlines again in the very near future. On the way back from Japan, I would also like to like FSS Siti Nuraisyah and Binte Sukerman because they looked after us like no other also. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH","positive"

"6747","Not really premium Frankly the seat is premium and that is about all. Food is economy with plastic cutlery and cups and plain bad. Comments apply for both outward and inward flights. It is a competitive market out there and I think that SA are relying on their reputation past too much and need to up their game. The A380 is a great aircraft and a preferred choise for us but next year we will not be using SA.","negative"
"6609","Not Worth the Price My friend and I had the chance to visit Singapore for the first time and what's best to go there than with Singapore Airlines, right? Well, it could have been very nice given the brand, but I did not have much pleasure aboard as it was very warm inside the plane. I had to use an improvised fan just to cool myself down during the flights from Manila to SG and SG to Manila. At first I thought it's just an isolated case, but to experience it twice could mean something else, right? Anyway, it was good to experience aboard SA.","positive"

"1061","Not what we were expecting. As this second leg of our trip coincided with my birthday my son treated my wife and I to a First class flight to Melbourne. He had previously flown to the UK in first. And wanted us to experience the high class service he had e perienced. Unfortunately it was not be be. Our seats were 1D and 1F and were spacious and comfortable enough for the 7 hour flight. The on board welcome was up to expectations for first class passenger of which there were only 4. The service was no more than OK, however my Lobster Thermidor book the cook meal was excellent. Not so my wife’s beef which was difficult to cut into. The amenity kit contained creams and lotions plus eye mask, socks and slippers. Value for money not really. We returned this week from Melbourne on Qatar Airways in business class which knocked the spots off Singapore Air’s First class service.","neutral"

"7234","Absolute failure of cabin crew No one could have anticipated what was going to happen when we came on board. This was SQ226, an afternoon flight from Perth to Singapore on 15 December 2018. Everything was normal, with the fake smiles and pleasantries. Getting to a destination unscathed is becoming less likely. Issue began about an hour or so into the flight. Yes, it had a lot of kids on board and yes, we understand the need to feed the kids first. However, we did not order any kids’ meals though we had an 11-yo and 9-yo travelling with us. We were seated in the middle, four abreast, and at no point did anyone approach us about kids’ meals. So it was a bit surprising when a stewardess came with a meal and stated (not asked if we had, stated) that we had ordered a kids’ meal. We said no, we did not. She then took it back to the galley. That should have been the end of it. Next came a steward. “You ordered a special meal.” “No, we did not”. This was getting weird. But more interesting was the next statement: “Are you in the right seats?” Hang on…….we are 1-1/2 hours into a flight and you ask if we are in the right seats? No, we are actually on the wrong freaking plane. What do you think? Meal was taken back again and this time the Leading Stewardess came out. Here is where it got corrected. The meal was for the family in front of us. Instead of apologising for the inconveniences, she threw us a stinky look. Seriously? If you cannot handle the heat, get out of the kitchen. Later on during the flight, I had to use the washroom. Same LSS bumped into me cause she was backing up with a trolley and once again, no apology. It’s my fault for getting in her way cause it was more important to count the alcohol bottles than service your guest. Service in Singapore Airlines is really going to the dogs and with this type of attitude from the LSS, one can see why. Promotions just because you have been in the job for a particular period of time is what drives down service excellence.","negative"
"8785","SINGAPORE-KOLKATA: TOP CLASS SERVICE The flight was delayed by 1 hour 15 min. The airline provided free snacks and printed apology letter to all customers at the boarding gate. This is very rare to found and highly appreciable! Pro: 1. Great attitude of staffs 2. Excellent food quality and beverage options 3. Good timing 4. More than an average quality in-flight entertainment system 5. Check-in and boarding are of top quality due to Singapore Changi airport Con: Nothing really...

"9184","Travel if you wanna know what is likely to fly with best airline in the World I would like to share my feedback on my recent & first trip With SQ. and why i choose to fly with SQ As per business need in my current organisation all ""C"" level need to travel frequently so with our corporate travel agent i book SQ as they ""Preferred"" & from my other team who has ever traveled with SQ they always says It's THE BEST! So I thought personally why not to feel it and see what’s make it best so i discovered promotion at SQ site and decided that's it’s the time where i need to experience, in-spite of long flight i thought i will have more time to explore so I flew. So I travel from Delhi to Bangkok via Singapore and vice versa. Amazing experience overall and what I have heard mostly ""Great food"" indeed it is and it exceeded my expectations Hindu meal- Non Veg- Best food I have ever had, best in class entertainment options ( i like specially Hindi movies collection from Asain part) although SQ 401 seems a bit outdated to me looking at entertainment options however even though all looks good to me, in lavatory all amenities were perfectly placed majorly i have seen everything and mostly i found clean and tidy too. SQ 978 which we boarded from Singapore to Bangkok was again perfect, cabin crew is happy to help you for everything that one need, i have to mentioned because economy class at times been treated secondary which i didnt felt while travelling with SQ. when I was travelling from Bangkok to Singapore- SQ 975 as seat was not getting adjusted I thought it’s non recliner but flight attended tried to adjust and informed its recliner seat and i was in forward seat zone not sure name Sarifash ( maybe) offered with great smile in case I would like to shift as it was short flight I didn’t wish to move but i could feel empathy! and that's what matter. what i love the most is Airbus 380- 800 SQ 406 while i travailed from Singapore to New Delhi, huge aircraft and i choose to be at upper Deck which was good idea. Meals were served hot all the time and if one has order any special meal they serve first to them then anyone. They kept us servicing water/Drinks so good in case one has long flight. Staff make sure that everyone get equal attention and they nailed it, if one starts travelling with Singapore Airlines would choose only to fly with SQ because it's The best!","positive"

Flying A380 on LAX- NRT-SIN route the service was consistently good attentive several menu items and literary numerous (more than 400 movies alone) entertainment options; the only discomfort was the temperature somehow SQ insisted on keeping the cabin quite cold.

"524","Severe drop in quality. My flight on February 18th shows how bad service has become since I flew with them in 2020. A flight of more than 14 hours. Two meals served of poor quality. One snack in between. I had to go back to the rear to get some water because no answer to the call and found the flight attendants eating. I hardly ever saw an attendant in between meals. Uncomfortable seats. Wi-Fi did not work for me. And this flying from their home base. The Singapore airport is amazing. It deserves a better home airline than what this has become.","negative"

"1937","Ontime all the way, both ways 4 flight round trip from London to Christchurch New Zealand via Singapore. 3 flight with Singapore Airlines and one with Air New Zealand on a code share. All on time. All good service - first choice meals on all. All provided good cabin staff and inflight service with plenty of between meal service options. The entertainment options were extensive catering for all ages with plenty of films music games and TV. E travelled with children who had good food service as well – one child is a fussy eater and the staff made specific sandwiches to cater for his needs. The Air NZ flight was a new aircraft and provided an onscreen order facility between meal services which I suspect will become the norm as they update their fleet. Ground staff at check-in at all 3 airports were equally efficient and professional. I have travelled this route 6 times and the last 3 have been Singapore Airlines/Air New Zealand combinations via Singapore – I will be doing the same again as I consider it great VfM. Well done to both Airlines, your staff are a credit to your companies","positive"

"1507","Disappointed with our Experience We have just returned from our first flights with Singapore. We were very much looking forward to flying with them in view of their recent number 1 rating. However, the service did not meet our expectations. The food was very good, and the cabin crew were really nice, but on both flights we found them to be very disorganised. On our way from UK to Singapore, the first meal came around, and we were asked what we wanted to drink, and both nominated G&T, and the reply was ""That will take some time"", and she explained they only carried wine with the food and we could have a G&T after all the meals were served. To be fair, we didn't wait long as we were the last to be served. On the way back, the crew were really confused, we had two trolleys serving , and both missed us, they were withdrawing when I pointed out we had no meals. Then they got the drinks wrong, and then the other crew delivered some more, which were different, it was a bit shambolic. However, that was all a bit of human error, and as I said, they were very nice, but the real issue is the entertainment. They were THE most rubbish selection of films we have ever experienced. They had what I would describe as two or three quality films, and the rest were awful. When we fly with Virgin, I watch good film after good film, but on this 14 hour flight, I watched one new film, and another B or C list unknown, and that was it, the rest were unwatchable.","neutral"
"5636","Wow. Amazing Experience and Staff First time flying with Singapore and will again given the chance. Business class as good or better than most long haul first class products. I had a special milestone birthday mid-air over the pacific at the international date line and the staff got word of it. They prepared and presented a custom card and cake with lights. I think every flight attendant and officer from the plane stopped by to wish me well. Amazing and unexpected. Kudos!","positive"

"10984","Moscow to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened. I spent my time and did that. In return I received a standard email with apologies.","negative"
"9565","Your worst nite mare come true! I literally work up one morning and found out that I was locked out of the booking I made for my dad with my three kids (all under 15). I could not access my booking on the web, and when I called to enquire, was told amongst others, that the main reason was that the only adult's flight on that booking was changed. Without my permission! Without my knowledge! Without prior checks with me, the person who bought the tickets and who thus is the only party privy to the contract! The customer service officer had the cheek to tell me that they can't speak with me till they verified me. Did they not verify the person who changed the ticket booking? Did they not realise that the amended booking was sent to A completely different email address? Does that indicate that it is a totally Different person calling in to make unauthorised changes? And that the change left 3 underraged kids, one of whom is only 8, on that booking which by definition and policy are not allowed to travel alone? The amended booking removing the Adult ticket resulted in exactly that, yet SIA had the audacity to ask me to pay us$100 per child, per flight sector for each ""unaccompanied cHild"", ie us$600, when I have absolutely no intention of them being unaccompanied? SIA messed up BIG time. Your ticket purchase is not safe! The secretary you fired, the ex-Girlfriend, ex-hubby can mess up all your bookings without your knowledge, and all SIA will tell you, is that they have stuck to their procedures! Do they not realise that the procedures are outdated and do not protect their customers' interest. In fact, their procedures expose us to unbelievable risks and inconveniences!!! Imagine turning up at the gate only to be told your flight has been cancelled, you you are liable for the cancellation fee, when you did not even initiate the cancellation! FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK!","negative"
"4621","Smooth flight with two kids Singapore airlines always makes it easy to travel with kids, this was my first without my partner so I was a little nervous. We were able to board early as travelling with kids (even though they are 7 & 9). We pre ordered kids meals, the best part about this is that they get them first so they are happily eating while the cart serves everyone else. The food was good, chicken lasagna and an assortment of snacks and juice, they even got a second meal of spaghetti bolognaise when we got afternoon tea and amazingly managed to eat it without spilling too much. I forgot to mention that the hosts also very nicely and efficiently request that the passengers travelling in front put their seats up when the kids meal arrived so we have room to move.","positive"

Stewardesses moved along the aisles to provide us with juices and water. Music was sufficient and there were loads of albums in the Entertainment system but there wasn't enough games. However, to those who read this review and might think that Singapore Airlines is not up to standard, I am being critical and to be honest, Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines I have ever flown.","positive"

"4722","My go-to airline This is the second time I've flown long haul with Singapore Airlines and there are a lot of reasons why I will choose it again over other providers; One: I trust the efficiency of the staff to deal with people with courtesy and good manners, even in economy. Two: they fly from Manchester, which is my closest international airport Three: Singapore Airport is the best airport in the world, no other comes close- it is clean, easy to get around, and offers a big variety of experiences and facilities that aren't all to do with shopping Four: flying from Manchester to Singapore means you get the longest bit of the journey first Five- the journey from Singapore to Melbourne is always the most relaxed and easy- going of any long haul trip I've been on. Six- it's just better than the rest- and I've flown a few!","positive"
"8362","Welcome to Business-Class - MA Spoiled it for me! I was actually underwhelmed; the Araliya lounge was small and a bit crowded, on there way out, and on the way in, the Silver Kris lounge was a bit less special than roaming outside, outside where there where massage chairs. And so much more to do. The last Business Class lounge we were in even had rooms that we could have cat-naps in. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I would have expected more from SQ which is a very, very good airline - especially since we were at its home base!","positive"

"10474","Perth to Singapore in July 2019. Mid-night flight fmainly to see how the 787 compares with the A350. Check-in was smooth save for the issue with them not allowing us to take the travel stroller, which folds into something the size of a briefcase on board as it wasn't in a carry bag? Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch. Breakfast served was good with all options available. Of the 4 legs this was probably the most disappointing from SQ, but still an enjoyable flight.","positive"
"693","Worst Service,Staff and 0 customer service Booked a flight from COK-SIN and SIN-LAX both under Singapore airline.COK-SIN flight got delayed by 20-30 minutes and still I reached before boarding time for next flight SIN-LAX.But baggage handling of SIN airline was so pathetic that they refused to shift my luggage to next flight due to insufficient time.I was not allowed to shift/hand carry it myself as well.These idiots gave me a flight after 14 hours later to SIN-LAX.Tried contacting customer care but no to response.Lost my whole day and never flying again on this piece of s—t. Pathetic service and hospitality.","negative"
"6708","Travel in style We travelled to New Zealand & stopped over in Singapore for 2 nights. The flight was lovely; attentive stewards. Nothing was too much trouble. I am tall but Economy class was fine for legroom. It was a night flight and we did manage to get some sleep. There was a choice of menu, free drinks & a good choice of recent movies. In fact, the entertainment system was excellent, catering for all ages & genres. I would certainly recommend Singapore Airlines and travel with them again.","positive"

"8418","Brilliant flight We flew with Singapore Air all the way to Sydney from London. We had a short stop over in Singapore on the way out but flew all the way back with a 55 minute stop, the staff were very attentive, hot towels, food and drink all the way, we flew premium economy which gave us just a little more comfort and space, food choice and bigger screens with noise reduction headphones, we slept most of the way home so they were obviously comfortable, I would highly recommend Singapore Air and would definitely fly with them again.","positive"
"4196","Always great service Always well organised, attendants remember requests. On time! My only issue was the passenger next to me was served too many whisky drinks during the flight and was obviously intoxicated as he tried to leave in Melbourne. This didn’t interfere with me directly, but he fell over twice. Given that he probably ordered from different staff it may have been hard to keep track of his consumption but it is something that should be thought about.","positive"
"2848","Premium Economy Lacklustre My partner and I were excited to be trying Singapore Airlines, has a good reputation for service. We were lucky to bid for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. Having flown with Virgin Australia and their award winning premium cabin, I assumed, wrongly, it would be similar. Not even close. The seat is bigger, yes. The recline is average. The leg rest and foot rest, offers no support. My foot got trapped between the metal bar foot rest and the leg rest. This was because it does not rise up, simply flops onto the floor. The seat is outdated and clunky. Old push buttons to recline. IFE screen is out of arms reach so you have to move out of the seat to reach it. I was in 31K emergency exit row hence the screen is a pull out version. Movies are limited for the box office western interest. I would have expected far more. The food was economy, you get first choice so no this was no.t worth the upgrade, nor the clunky old seat. Service was poor. I thought it was supposed to be award winning. No drinks offered until after the meal service. I pressed my call bell, watched up to 6 cabin crew walk past us whilst the light was on, until I flagged one down in desperation. Only then I could ask for a drink that wasn’t water or juice. I did complain and the response was to simply press the call bell if I want something. I thought the service was better in premium, it is not. This is what you expect in economy and is far from any premium service I have seen. SIA, look at Virgin Australia’s premium service, dedicated cabin crew, individualised service to each passenger. Not drinks on demand, crew are there to offer any time including a self serve snack area. Do not pay for premium economy until they have come up to the standard of other airlines. The crew were lacklustre on this flight and showed little interest in service for the guests. Disappointing. I had a slightly better experience returning Singapore to Sydney however on approach to landing, our cabin crew member sitting in front of us row 31 aircraft RHS fell asleep. This is the critical period for any emergency and the reason crew are there. Luckily nothing happened and she awoke when we hit the runway.","negative"

The estimated 22"" seat spacing used for a 14hr flight is hideous. If such tight spacing is used the seats should fixed with no recline. With such tight spacing it is extremely difficult for a person of average western size BN to get in/out of the seat when the person in front reclines the seat. Food ok staff lovely","neutral"
"1239","Flying Perth to Narita during covid Extremely unusual time to fly as we needed an exemption to fly out of Australia from the government. We obtained one as working in Tokyo for the year as teachers. The check in procedure does take a lot longer as more paperwork and phone calls are needed to check if you are allowed to travel. The staff were excellent in explaining the procedure as they are working with very few numbers. The flight had 40 people only, so lots of room and yes we had 3 seats each. The service of meals and beverages was done very quickly and efficiently. Changi airport was like a ghost town with most shops closed and all passengers are walked/transported to a transit zone until your next flight is ready. You are then walked in single file or transported to your next flight, so very strange as at times their seemed be more workers in PPE gear than passengers. The steps we went through at Narita were extensive, downloading apps, fill in paperwork and giving a saliva sample to test for covid 19. It took about 2 hours to get through the steps and we only sat down for maybe 10 minutes at the last stop to get back your covid results. The people involved were fantastic and we were lucky that we were numbers two and three in the initial first line up, but still over 2 hours it took so be aware. We knew we were quick as the people picking us up told us we were first out.","positive"

"6219","Shame about the new business class configuration I recently flew to Singapore from Zurich. I used to do this flight quite often in the A380. In this flight they have re configured the seats replacing the big manual seats for modern electric ones. Now here is a perfect example of changing something just for the sake of changing. The previous seats folded down into a spacious bed. Ok you had to do it manually but honestly nobody minded doing this and the crew was always very helpful to make the bed when needed. To my huge disappointment they have now put some standard seats. They are small and your feet don't fit. I am an average man, height 180, shoe size 44 EUR and weight 80 kgs. Neither big nor small. My feet fit but there is insufficient space to fit. What a shame SQ has made this change!","neutral"
"9416","Unimpressed We followed their instructions and printed our check in and boarding passes but this was a complete waste of time and paper as we had to do self boarding passes when at Heathrow. Flight took off 40 minutes late. It was very hot but no drinks were offered until the meal. The air vent controls were well out of reach when sitting. I printed a copy of Singapore airport as the airline couldn't tell us what terminal we were landing at Singapore for transfer to Darwin. Breakfast was served, after the usual sleep period,at mid afternoon local time. The transfer at Singapore, only 2 hours, was ok. another meal was served almost immediately on our leg to Darwin-very similar to the one we had before. Both planes were very clean and the attendants quietly efficient.","positive"
"11066","First time we flew Singapore Airlines Business Class from Singapore to Sydney and return. Outbound boarding was on time. But soon after pushed back, the aircraft returned to its parking position due to electrical problem, resulting in one hour delay. Upon took-off all passengers who sat in business class asked the cabin crew to convert our seats to bed mode because it was an after midnight flight. We slept for about 5 hours and were woken up by the FA for breakfast, whereas our daughter was left sleep until half an hour before landing in Sydney. The meals were tasty and glasses were filled up frequently. FA were friendly, except one stewardess looked not so interested in serving us. We landed in Sydney only 20 minutes behind schedule. Inbound flight : Check in process went very fast and served by a friendly ground staff. Boarding was also on time. The cabin crew were friendlier compared with their compatriots in our outbound flight. However, we couldn't sleep/rest due to turbulence weather which we experienced almost the entire journey. All in all we really enjoyed our business class experience with Singapore Airlines.","positive"

All staff were excellent and dealt with full flights with the 1st flight on an Airbus A350, with the 2nd flight on a Boeing 777-300, that arrived about 30 min's early into Heathrow.

We were separated from economy by a flimsy partition wall and ineffectual curtain. Directly behind us were 2 crying babies. I felt very sorry for the parents and I know it can't be helped but I think the divider should be more solid sound barrier. Also when seats in front were reclined it was almost impossible for me to get out. I was very disappointed in this- my first experience in premium economy. And it was very expensive.","neutral"

"10978","Melbourne to Singapore. I have for the second time in 2 years lost my baggage. This time I arrived last night and my baggage never appeared on the carousel. I went to report it missing to be told that I didn't check in any baggage. I flew with two fellow workers who verified that I did (not sure why they didn't believe me) and I left my details. After numerous calls in the morning, I was told my baggage had turned up on another carousel at T3, and they would call me when it was being delivered. That was early this morning, it is now 4.30pm and I cannot get though to the ""hot line"" to check if they could give me an approximate time, no joy there either.

When the lights dimmed for evening staff walked around the cabin very regularly with water and juice, I was so grateful for this as I was super thirsty.

"1348","Terrible Customer Service. Think twice. My boyfriend and I choose to fly with Singapore Airlines for a trip to Japan this year after having a great experience last year. We have encountered various issues in trying to acquire a refund since travel has been banned to Japan due to the pandemic. First, we spent over an hour on hold and we’re charged over $100 in international phone charges without having our issue resolved by customer service. Next, we tried using the online portal to request a refund and never hear back even though our trip was supposed to have started earlier in the month. Finally, we reached out to them on Facebook messenger. We needed update our payment information since we have been issued a new card since we originally booked our flight a year ago. We explained our issue to the representative and they said we needed to send messages in smaller question since they didn’t understand English. Next they told us we needed to get a letter from our bank and file and appeal in order to update the payment information for the refund. They also said it would take them a while to send me the form so I could not get started. This process has taken place over the course of three months and we have yet to receive a refund. While we enjoyed our flight last year, the atrocious customer service will definitely make us think twice before booking with Singapore Airlines again.","negative"

"7579","A strategy to force paying for seats?? This review is to highlight a possibly planned strategy by SIA to force economy class travelers to pay for their seats. The rating given here in no way reflects the level of service provided by SIA which I consider to be excellent and by far superior to most other airlines. When I booked tickets for my wife and myself I opted out paying for 'preferred' seats as we were more than happy for the airline to allocate the seats for us assuming (which I consider not unreasonable) that both of us will be give adjacent seats. We were in fact allocated adjacent seats on all other sectors but on this flight where my wife was allocated 53E and I was allocated 55G. This allocation was done well ahead of our departure date and I noticed it when I tried to do an online check in. On the day of travel, at the check in counter I was told that since I did not pay for 'preferred' seating SIA cannot guarantee adjacent seats although it was a single booking. I was told that at the gate they will have to ask other travelers to see whether anyone can do a swap so that we can get adjacent seats. I told the duty manager that I assumed that airlines will try to allocate adjacent seats even though I had not requested and paid for 'preferred' seats. The duty manager was obviously not interested in offering any help. At the gate, I was told that they were able to get two seats on the same row but not adjacent ones and we were allocated 55C and 55G. The airline had 3x3x3 seat configuration thus, ABC EFG IJK which meant my wife was allocated seat C then two others and then myself. The gate staff also mentioned that AB and EF are allocated to one family and they would try to see whether they are willing to swap. The family of four was asked the question but they did not understand what the request was and they refused the request. However, once inside the aircraft, the lady understood the problem and kindly agreed to the swap - thanks, fellow traveler! This makes me believe that SIA makes no attempt at all to allocate adjacent seats for those who are on a single booking - not only we were allocated seats randomly, the family of four (one adult and three small children) were allocated disjointed seating. (I presume they would have been on a single booking as well). The aircraft was not 100% full. In fact, the seat initially allocated to my wife, 53C remained vacant and there were few other seats unoccupied during this flight. This makes me think that this is a calculated strategy by SIA to force those who do not pay for seats to reconsider paying for them when booking new flights specially after being bitten by such episodes. If that is the case, it is a very poor deal by SIA. If my assumption is wrong, then obviously, SIA's seat allocation algorithms are good for nothing. Either way, it reflects very poorly of SIA's claim to be able to listen and meet customers' needs.","negative"

"627","Flight attendants not always attentive to passengers I flew Singapore Airlines for several flights in December. Most of the time, the service was good, but on my flight from SIN to SFO, the flight attendants’ service went down over the course of the flight. I’m averse to seafood so I did not eat the smoked salmon or shrimp salad appetizers. The flight attendant serving me starting acting more judgy after that, saying, “I guess you’re not gonna eat this” while taking away the appetizer and giving me the main dish. Also, for the shrimp salad appetizer I was never given the bread supposed to come with it. After the main meal I wasn’t given the snack (grapes and cheese) or the dessert, until I asked for the dessert. My dishes also weren’t taken away within an hour unless I pressed the person button thing. That bothered me because I wanted to rest and I couldn’t clear my table and put the tray away unless I asked. The flight attendants on that trip, two of them didn’t provide the best service and did the bare minimum so that they could go back to talking with the other flight attendants. I’m sure other passengers needed service too, but instead of working, the flight attendants talked during most of the flight for an hour or more to each other. However, other cabin crews in my experience on Singapore Airlines were better and less gossipy and chit chatty during the flight.","neutral"

Still think the IFE system is showing its age compared to say Emirates but quite OK and had no problem finding a few movies to watch on the daytime return flight. My complaints remain the same as ever. The business class seat is plain weird and for taller types like me the diagonal sleeping position is only just long enough. In addition SQ start to look expensive compared to the Gulf carriers for the route I was travelling (SIN-ZRH-NCE) by a couple of thousand S$ which is substantial.","positive"

The crew are very attentive but not over bearing and my kids love the attention.

"7286","Subpar I have been flying Singapore Airlines for more than two decades, and this airline has always performed leaps and bounds above other airlines in terms of its service and efficiency. Whether for business or personal travel, I've always looked forward to my SIA flights despite the long journey from the US to Southeast Asia. The last two times that I have flown on SIA however, I feel as though the service and the quality of its offering has not measured up to the accolades that they have received over the years. Perhaps complacency has set in and SIA is now resting on its laurels? On my last flight, I was traveling with my spouse. We were attending a wedding and therefore had to carry on formalwear. SIA did not accommodate our request to hang our garments, and instead, told us to stash our tuxedo and dress in an overhead bin. This resulted in a lot of headaches when we arrived at our destination. Furthermore, the meals that we were served throughout the flight were frankly atrocious. For an airline that has often been ranked ""#1 in the world"", we expected better, and had been served better food on other international long-haul flights. Additionally, the availability of meal options was extremely poor - they ran out of the meal selection that we wanted, and we were given cold sandwiches and chips instead. To be frank, the sandwiches were more palatable than the ""gourmet"" options that were presented to us rather stylishly on a fancy-looking menu. When the flight attendants noticed that we were not eating, they did try to address the situation, but aside from the sandwich and the bag of chips, we received instead a lecture about ordering our meal ahead of time, ""next time”, which I’m not sure is a standard practice for travelers without special dietary requirements. It felt more like they were shifting the blame onto us. I'm not certain if there is going to be a “next time” either, because while Singapore Airlines used to be the carrier of choice for us while flying for business/leisure to Southeast Asia, there are other reputable, high-quality options available now. We have flown Eva before (had a wonderful experience) and we have heard rave reviews regarding Korean Air from our fellow travelers arriving in Southeast Asia. All in all, a rather disappointing experience for a usually-reliable airline. I would say that our most recent trip was an isolated case, but we've noticed a palpable decline in the quality that we have come to expect of SIA.","neutral"
"67","Unfortunately Low-Cost Behavior I bought a round-trip ticket with my family from Dubai to Japan via Singapore Airlines with Singapore Airlines. I have Elite Plus status in Star Alliance. He canceled flight SQ496, which would depart at 01:15AM on the return leg, and offered us flight SQ494, which would depart at 15:10. Our transit time in Singapore increased from 2 hours to 16 hours. We requested a hotel in our correspondence with Singapore Airlines regarding this matter. Our request was rejected and we were told that we could return the ticket or sleep in the lounge. It is not easy to cancel the ticket. Because we paid all the hotel fees in Japan. The suggestion that we could sleep in the Lounge with Star Alliance Elite Plus status was a very simple suggestion indeed.","negative"
"8784","Excellent flying experience: CCU-SIN As usual, another very good flying experience. Pros: 1. Very good service by cabin crews 2. Good food quality and beverage options..special meals available and provided the earliest 3. Immigration and baggage collection is the fastest (maybe in the world) due to Changi airport...bag always comes before reaching to belt after immigration in Singapore Con: In-flight entertainment options could be better and LCD screen quality could be better. Otherwise no such cons..","positive"
"5412","a great way to fly!!! the service & attention that was given to my wife & I, on this flight was absolutely the best, even though this flight was almost full in business class, on the a380, you would not know it, the service ran like clockwork, one on one, very personal & attentive, S A are a class airline & certainly value for money, with out doubt. a special mention to fss karnsita & fss raphaella , who went over & above to make sure we had the best of everything. 100% S A , you remain our choice of carriers.","positive"
"9557","The excellence airline Singapore airline services are excellent, start from greetings, check in, at their lounge, during the flight until the baggage claim. Everything leaves you the great impression and experience.","positive"
"3211","Lovely friendly staff It was a great flight. We were lucky to have the sears behind a bulk head so had lots of leg room. On our return trip not so fortunate & sandwiched like sardines. The crew were fantastic & nothing was an issue. Food & beverages were lovely.","positive"
"8293","Excellent from Singapore Airlines Great flight on the new Airbus 380, very smooth and comfortable. Service is slick with a very efficient crew who make you feel welcome. On Board entertainment is good with a wide selection of entertainment to help pass the time away. Food is good and comprehensive enough to ensure you don't go either hungry or thirsty. Choice for both Asian or European dishes being served. Plenty of luggage allowance with options to pre book you seat should you wish to. All in all Singapore airlines are good and come recommended.","positive"
"8421","Nice for family travel or with children Everything is recommendable, we travel with young children and got to board first. Kids meal and toys for them. Snacks and drinks to keep us hydrated. The only thing is their sounds system tend to have some problems we experienced only sound for 1 side of the headset instead of both for both ways of flight.","positive"
"8621","everything in order but something missing large aircraft, great crew, decent enough food. Entertainment was not good and the controls were not comfrrtable. Seat too was ok but not really comfy. Its also upsetting when you are the first to check in online and you get only a small handful of middle seats to choose. Thats unfair.","positive"
"2254","IFE not working The short trip of slightly over 2 hrs was marred by the IFE (In Flight Entertainment) not been able to work after a few minutes of flight duration. Every attempt by the staff to get it up and running by rebooting the system failed. Fortunately it was just a short trip. Imagine if this happened on longer duration flights. Also as this is an old plane model 777-200 and upgrading doesn’t make sense, the screen was a let down as compare to newer ones on new aircraft types. Hope SIA quickly replace this with the Boeing 787 or Airbus 350. Overall service crew of SIA are impeccable.","positive"
"2389","Most Enjoyable flight Allways a great experience flying with Singapore airlines. The staff were extremely helpfull as upond looking for our seat my Husband and I discovered we had been separated for seating. A airhostest was unable to help us as the plane was fully booked, she came back to us after the plane and taken off and appoligised and the gave us special treatment with giving us first option for lunch service and other special help throught out the flight. The seating was very comfortable and the entertainment as well. I would certainly fly again with Singpore airlines.","positive"
"4518","great experience friendly flight attendants, comfortable seating and plenty of room, great food, great film selection, would definitely fly again.","positive"
"9608","Best to oz along with the mid east airlines I have flown 10 times back and forth from the uk to australia with singapore airlines and they are always the no 1 choice to go economy with. Especially on their newer A380 where the legroom in economy is good even for me at 186cm. Second choice is qatar or etihad via mid east. Prefer singapore airport though as so spacious and lots to do. Food and service always great with singapore too.","positive"
"5500","Long haul tolerable This was a 13 hour flight and knowing what a reasonable flight we had coming out we were not looking forward to the home flight. Crew were lovely and the plane was clean, but the meals were awful. Semi- scrambled egg and ratatouille for breakfast??? Seats were usual economy cramped but that’s only to be expected. Entertainment was excellent with a lot of new films, tv shows and good music","positive"
"7209","flights from Wellington to Perth We flew to Perth stopping over at Melbourne, both flights were great, meals lovely and staff were good. The seats were comfortable and the in house service was fine, no complaints at all. We booked on Webjet early in the year and got a fantastic fare to Perth from Wellington, NZ, $186 per person one way!!!!","positive"
"8970","Good, could be better It seems a lot to pay for some extra legroom and further layback, some noise cancelling headphones and the chance to chose your meals, but when you walk through cattle class to use the toilet, it all seems worthwhile. On the negative side, you have to use the economy toilets, which means a bit of a trek down the aisle dodging flight crew; you also have pretty close proximity to crying littlies in the front row of economy, which can be only a metre or two away. The noise cancelling headphones are a boon though for cutting unwanted noise. Even though its a bit pricey, we won't be flying economy again - I think Singapore could do this better, but it is a definite improvement over being cramped into the tiny seats further aft.","positive"
"356","Dishonest and incompetant I had trouble right from the free online 48 hour check in phase. I selected seats and was rejected. So I rang and eventually spoke to someone who told me that I would have to pay to make these seat selections because I had already made selections. He would not accept that I had not made any previous selections and would not answer my question of why I would have to pay in the free 48 hour window. I told him that I did not want the seats that had somehow already been allocated to me - he then stated that the flight was full and no changes were possible. I asked to speak to his supervisor. She then stated that airline policy is to allocate seats 72 hours before departure. I then asked what was the point of the free 48 hour seat allocation process which is on the airline's website? No answer. She finally agreed to send an email to some other department asking whether my wife could be seated in the aisle seat in front of me rather than next to me, because we both wanted aisle seats on a long (15 hour) flight. No mention of the flight being full. She promised that I would receive a response that evening. Later, I received an email showing only me on the flight - my wife's booking had disappeared. I rang again, and was promised that she would be somewhere on the plane, but not necessarily near me. I stated that that was not good enough and that we wanted isle seats with her in front of me. Again later that night, I received an email stating that she was now seated in an isle seat in front of me which is what we had requested. All good finally? NO. We got to the airport next morning, got our seat allocation tickets and my wife's seat was back next to me, not on the isle as stated. We asked whether this could be changed and were told all seats had been filled, including the promised seat in front of me. So we had been lied to both verbally and by email. We then experienced the worst cabin service possible on the flight. We were second from the back and for some reason, were ignored when meals and liquid refreshments were issued. The cabin service seemed to start from in front of us. Eventually, we had to ask for the food and drinks that others had already received. The meals, once we had finally got them, were reasonable. That could not be said for the meals on the return flight from Vancouver to Singapore, then Singapore to Australia. They were almost inedible - mainly baked beans, some type of powdered egg and formed chicken which were barely even warm. We were told on both legs that they had run out of the popular meals, so we got what was left. If we had not been so hungry, we would have returned the meals. In addition, no drinks were served for the first 2 hours of the Singapore leg - again we had to ask for water. I also found food scraps on my fold up table, from the previous flight. There was also a food stain on the seat. It did raise questions about whether the area had been cleaned after the end of the previous flight - it was definitely a health regulation breach. So it seems to us that Singapore Airlines are trying to do things cheaply by reducing service and food quality levels, and quite prepared to mislead customers over seat allocation procedures when queried. They used to be our preferred airline, but given our experiences on this return flight, we will never fly with them again. We would urge anyone thinking of booking with them to try another airline. They were once a reliable and quality brand, but we could not say that about them now.","negative"
"8317","Food not good Was not that impressed with Singapore airlines The crew were brilliant, Poor food quality, entertainment was a bit out of date, On the flight from Singapore to Brisbane we had no entertainment as the screen was not working. We would not fly with Singapore airlines again.","negative"
"5062","Fantastic 1st class The experience of flying 1st class with Singapore on their A380 suite exceeded my expectations. The suites are spacious,the champagne, wine and food fantastic. The staff were friendly and met our every need. It ticked all the boxes on my bucket list. It was well worth it.","positive"
"8853","Friendly, professional - One of the best Dad flew by Singapore Airlines, he is 75+, the flight was comfortable, staff at the airline office, airport and in the aircraft were friendly and helpful.","positive"
"4288","Once again a very good experience on Singapore Airlines I last wrote about Singapore Airlines in July 2017. The good experience continues. I am happy to note this consistency. The 2017 travel was for my company work, this one (today) was on my own. While they are still good but I could not see anything great. The aircraft was good and new. Food was good too.","positive"
"10289","Singapore Airlines ranged from excellent to good. Syd-Sin-Cph (Oct 6, 2022) was excellent. Of course in Economy we were packed like sardines, but the tin was large enough (and neighbours small enough) that we weren't particularly uncomfortable. This is the third time we've flown post-Covid. The first time on Thai it seemed that Covid was the excuse to give no service at all but Singapore Airlines both at Xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service. Food was very good and alcohol plentiful. The entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul. Flight attendants were very attentive. We stopped over in Singapore on our way home. Unfortunately Sin-Syd leaves shortly after midnight. The flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left. This is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether we'd be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg. Of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint.","positive"
"9813","The best airline Singapore airlines is the best - from checkin to the inflight service, the flat beds in business class, everything is always perfect. They have good vegetarian options and that is a relief on long haul flights.","positive"
"4247","There is no way better to fly as with Singapore Airlines It was my 18th flight from Berlin-Zurich-Singapore-Melbourne/Sydney-Singapore-Munich-Berlin. And my first flights in Premium Economy from ZUR-SIN-MEL-/SYD-SIN and I was so happy and lucky with all my flights with Singapore Airlines. In Premium Eco. You have more legroom, bigger screens, 3 options for oder a meal for Lunch/Breakfast or Dinner. A bwater bottle on your suit. And the suits are most comfort for this premium eco. class for sleep on long flights. So was very happy to enjoy the flights. And of course the Crew Members are so helpful in every service on board and very friendly.","positive"
