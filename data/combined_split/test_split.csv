"4261","Outstanding service from ground to air This was a direct flight on SQ 35 and SQ 36 between LAX and SIN on the A350 aircraft. Service was great from the Star Alliance lounge to gate staff to the inflight crew. Onboard, the cabin crew was very attentive yet not intrusive. This flight exemplifies the first class service that is the hallmark of Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"10685","Danang to Adelaide via Singapore. Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service, however, the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight (which was code shared on SQ ticket) was very average. Old plane, the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight - no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice, a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing. New A350 has poor leg room and when the person in front reclined i could not bend my legs and had to keep them straightened under the seat in front. IFE very average. Wouldn't go out of my way to fly Singapore again.","negative"

"8629","First time flying SQ business class for my wife and I did not disappoint We have flown Singapore airlines numerous times over the years, always in Economy. So we thought we would spend a heap of frequent flyer points and try Business class with them this time. I have flown Business class in Qantas and Virgin over the years but my wife had never flown Business class. Checkin was efficient and seamless, we were given fast track cards for immigration, advised where the lounge was and that our boarding group was second. The lounge in Melbourne was small dark and adequate, great drink selection and limited food options. The plane for this flight was a 777-300ER wide body plane, leaving at 3.40pm, we had found the legroom in Economy to be better on this aircraft in the past. But nothing compares to the space we had in Business. We were seated in row 12 seats D and F. ( there are only 4 seats per row in Business ) This is in the ‘mini’ cabin just behind first class, and I would absolutely recommend seats in this section, check seat guru or expert flyer websites to check your seats. Remember you can preselect seating months out with SQ. Boarding we were met by name and shown to our seats, our coats were taken and hung up, and a welcome glass of champagne or juice offered. They also cam by later to check what we wanted to drink after take off. This flight was a 7 hour one but still two meal services scheduled. Entree was seared tuna salad, main we had ordered from SQ’s ‘book the cook’, I chose lamb shank curry. There were a selection of warm bread rolls including garlic bread. Desert was a choice of two, ( I got both as there were spare, and I asked ;) ), after desert was a cheese and fruit trolley with a variety of cheese and quince paste, dry nuts, dried fruit and fresh fruit. After this coffee and chocolates were offered. On every course there were matched wines offered, from France, Italy, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, with recommendations made for each course. The chair was able to convert to a fully flat bed. I watched a movie and had a nap reclined but not in bed mode, it was still very comfortable, giving me a 2 hour nap. After my nap, I watched another movie, and another meal was served. Overall a very food rich flight. We had a 4 hour transit in Changi before our next flight to Paris.","positive"
"5818","Bisbane to Singspore to Sri Lanka I do use other alines but prefer Singapore Airlines if the ffoute fits my schedule. I recengly flew from Brisbane Australia to Singapore and like most people I changed to another flight at Singapore. As always I was very happy with journey and food was pretty good for airline food. I have long legs so was able to get an exit seat without paying a premium. I trust them as from what I have seen they have very high standards, but zre sometimes mord expensive than other airlines.","positive"
"11071","Perth to Zurich return via Singapore. I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should please read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, I'll do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore Airlines and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future. FYI I was going to make a complaint to them on their own site but after going through all I did with their online support last time I feel like its pointless and I am probably wasting my time as no one reads the emails (I can assume).","negative"

Comfortable seats with ample leg space, good reclining angle, wide variety of Inflight Entertainment. Cabin Crew never hesitated to provide food/drinks we wanted. Takeoff and landing was very smooth and minimal vibration. Ontime departure and early arrival at Singapore. Our next flight was from Singapore to Chennai- comfortable and efficient service. Highly recommend Singapore Airlines for everyone. Looking forward for our return journey from Chennai to Sydney.","positive"
"10441","Singapore to Amsterdam. Fantastic airline with great food. The plane was quiet and the Skybed came to good use as I slept more than 8 hours. In business class, we are greeted by name and the air crew were friendly and professional.

"10557","Munich to Singapore. Unfortunately SQ uses LH services & lounges in MUC. Senator lounge service was extremely poor. We did not feel welcome neither at arrival, neither inside. Wines (of low quality) are not in self-service, quantity served in glasses are severely controlled and personnel (when present) showed agressivity to all customers. Food was inedible (overcooked minced pork), with no other choice. Wi-Fi did not work well. Bad service could also be testified at boarding where LH personnel showed bad mood and did not respect the usual SQ procedures with obvious privileges for their Miles &More passengers. On the other hand we were pleased by the new seats on A350. Plane is fabulous, service was top-notch. We did not want to leave that plane. It is shocking to see that both airlines are quoted 5 stars. LH has a long long way to go to get there.","positive"
"10843","Sydney to New Delhi via Singapore. The food (IVML) served on my flight from Sydney to Singapore was horrible. I complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. The food on Singapore to Delhi flight was also below average. I previously always had an above average experience with SIA but looks like they are cutting costs. I pay a premium to fly with SIA and expect services of acceptable standards. Will not fly with them in future.","negative"
"3722","Tech great Passenger comfort not. We looked forward to the flight as it was a new A350-900 - The aircraft was great but the airline economists (bean counters) went for lightweight seats that were not comfortable for a long flight. Seats with an additional 1-2 cm of padding would help with comfort over long distances.","neutral"
"5462","Economy 787-10 Pleasantly surprised with the legroom in Economy I am over 6 ft tall and comfort is something I find not great as usually travel Business Class on long haul flights.The entertainment system is generous with programs easy to navigate windows larger seats comfortable have no hesitation in recommending this Airline and aircraft.","positive"
"5078","it was a nice safe flight we were traveling with my family. I am with my wife and 2 daughters, one is below 2 yrs old.

"5683","Best and most comfortable airline in the world Seats are roomy (unlike the wishbone coffin like seats of Cathay and other carriers). Aisles, seating area, and toilets are spotless (unlike Cathay and other carriers). Staff is extreme hospitable, gracious, polite and willing to look after passengers as their chargé d’affaire. This amount of painstaking detail cannot be found in any other carrier period. The pilots need to be commended most of all. The reason being is they arrived early not to chit chat but to speak with ground control across their path and to other arriving pilots which in turn helped them map out a proper flight path that was free of turbulence. In today’s day and age it is erroneous to blame turbulence on anything other than the pilot as it can be mitigated. We have ample satellites and monitoring stations that can outline the pockets of turbulence. Therefore on other carriers it is the pilot’s fault for plotting a rubbish flight path. As the pilots arrived too late adhering to their clock-in rather than their passion for flying. They never bothered to check with ground control along their path or with other pilots on said path. And so they just plot the quickest flight path that will garner them their additional incentive for saving fuel and arriving early; and that is much to the demise of passenger comfort. It is clear those pilots of other carriers such as Cathay have no business flying as they are not passionate about their vocation and are simply there to collect a pay cheque. They are for a lack of a better word - Dead wood that needs to be let go. The pilots of Singapore Airlines are TOP GUNS. They are passionate about their craft (pun intended) and put passenger comfort upfront and above their incentive.","positive"
"9911","Like Singapore Airlines Like Singapore Airlines a lot. Very good customer service, very kind and very quick response to passengers needs. The plane was very new and clean, however leg room was not great and the seat felt a little bit small. Food was okay but i noticed the meal sizes have gone smaller since i traveled with them back in 2016. The in flight entertainment system is good but internet is not free. Have used internet services free of charge with different airlines, however i would recommend Singapore Airlines to any one. They got my tick of approval","positive"
"10717","Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. A fantastic experience. Good service and hospitality accorded to me. Nice leg room and array of entertainment options. The transits were well-handled, and despite a short rest at Moscow Airport (less than 1 hour), the plane was cleaned and the next leg from Moscow to Stockholm seems like taking off in a new plane. Staff were attentive and helpful.","positive"
"1521","I had an abusive drunk behind me and should not have been allowed on the plane. I normally experience nothing but excellence from this airline, however, in this instance I was really disappointed with the service from the stewards and was amazed that he was allowed on board at Changi. He made the trip to Adelaide the worst I have ever experienced. The stewards were reluctant to shift me or any other passengers effected by him. Apparently the plane was full. I would have to rethink Singapore Airlines again though. But they are a good airline. Usually. I hope this is a once off.","neutral"
"797","Let down Booked and paid for seats well in advance. Was told that seats were no longer available, and separated me, my wife and grandchildren when giving us other seats. Also left two of our cases behind on return. No help or consideration..Left our house key in one case.(I know, very stupid) cost £245 for emergency locksmith...No sympathy from Singapore Airlines..if cases were lost. Then I could have claimed, but they had our cases and refuse to take any responsibility. Lots of other little things went wrong. Ruined a trip of a lifetime....I can honestly say, I can rough it with the best, and except that things can go wrong. But they could have been a lot more understanding with the situations....No more Singapore Airlines for me...","negative"
"7429","Average SIA used to be one of the best. Sadly is has deteriorated dramatically. Over past 12 months I have flown Business, Prem Econ and Econ. All have failed to impress me. The lounges in Singapore, Perth and Brisbane are very average with terrible choice of wines and very little in the way of food. Food is very average on flights as well in lounges. I recently flew Aust to US business with Air NZ. Food and beverages are light years in front of SIA. I will avoid them from now on whenever possible... Will never recommend them....","neutral"
"961","Awful service. Worst ever! 3 years agio this business class product used to be a quality one. Now it is absolutely awful. Aircraft is messy, old and dirty, but that's not even the headline of awful. It is the staff. From the minute you enter the lounge to the time you exit the flight, it is so unpleasant bordering on hostile. I have never experienced a worse business class airline experience in my life, and I can't even imagine how bad the economy class must be!!!","negative"
"6252","Good flight Good flight. The seats were comfortable and we had enough leg room. It is just annoying when the people in front put there seats back and then watch the entertainment, it seems a case of"" I can so I will"".

We would use Singapore airlines again, the cabin crew were very nice and efficient and the flight overall wasn't too bad for such a long time.","positive"

I heard horror story that passengers booked Cathay and only been told 3 days beforehand that they are going to be bumped off as cathay oversold their tickets. Luckily this didn't happen. Singapore Airlines honored their service which is highly important. The flights were on schedule. Covid 19 measures were clear and I felt safe.","positive"
"11088","Paris to Melbourne via via Singapore. After premium economy to Paris we flew home in Business Class with Singapore Airlines and really enjoyed the experience. Check in at CDG was smooth and we headed to the Star Alliance lounge which is not bad, except getting a seat was a real challenge as it handles so many airlines. Boarding on the A380 was orderly and seated in seats 18 and 19 K on the window. Drinks prior to take-off with French champagne and orders taken for lunch. Flight entertainment was excellent as was the service from a very professional crew. Landed in Singapore about 30 mins early so had time to freshen up in the lounge before boarding for Melbourne. Boeing 777 aircraft with the new Business class seats which again were very comfortable. Daylight flight so had a chance to watch more movies and enjoy the excellent in flight service. Overall you can see why Singapore Airlines are very good at what they do.","positive"
"7329","Amazing service We flew out on the airbus a380 on the way there and Boeing 777 on the way back. Both aircraft were a bit dated but they were very clean and nothing seemed broken. What makes Singapore one of the best airlines is the service which is second to none. All staff are polite and nothing is to much of a problem. The food was good both ways. Entertainment is up to date and there is plenty to watch. Overall the flight was smooth and on time. I would highly recommend this airline to anyone.","positive"

"8441","Slow check in but good flight. We had done an online check in and only had to have our bags weighed and we were thinking that the process will be pretty quick, unfortunately this wasn't to be the case. The queue at check in was not long but it took an extraordinary amount of time to get to the counter. There were numerous people with overweight bags who then set about sorting the contents of their bags out at the counter. I really think these people should be asked to move away from the counter, sort out their bags and then rejoin the queue, holding everyone else up just does not seem right. Other people for reasons unknown took so long to process it had us scratching our heads. Once we reached the counter processing our bags took about 4 minutes and we were out of there. The flight however was very good, the staff are excellent and the meals served were really quite good. The onboard entertainment was more than enough for a flight of that length and even in economy the legroom was quite adequate.","positive"

The Chief Stewardess did an excellent service during this flight.

On time, comfortable and they never stop feeding you! We took up offer to bid for upgrade to premium economy, which we were successful for Singapore to Manchester flight. Wouldn’t do it again. Very little difference to being in economy. We had booked ( and paid for ) extra leg room in economy and this would have been a better option if you can get it.","positive"
"9300","Choose yr flight from Brisbane Carefully The problem with this flight was the equipment (an ""old"" Boeing 777) and the arrival time in Changi. On previous flights (at different times) we have had newer aircraft..which have a few more features...such as USB ports for charging phones etc. If going to Europe - the arrival time in Changi leaves you with about 6-8 hours for connecting flights. Even tho there are transit hotels - they are always booked out. So you have to try and find a comfortable chair to get some sleep. With an arrival of 00:15 - I cannot understand why SQ wants to serve a ""full"" meal just before landing. The actual meals offered were not so so special. Why not just offer a sandwich or wrap?? Faster and easier to serve, no need for utensils etc etc - so no single use plastics involved. Of the airlines serving the destinations I visit - SQ is still the best of the bunch...","positive"

Drinks served in plastic beakers, roast chicken tough as was the meat in the noodle dinner. Orange juice concoction was not a premium offering. Toilets - we had to walk half way back down the Economy cabin to queue for the toilet. One toilet on the plane was not working.

Long story short on the website my premium tickets are 2500.00 after we book everything I get a pending charge for 20k. I call back and they tell me I agreed to the charge. How can I agree to pay 20k for tickets online priced at 2500 that's makes no sense at all. Then they tell me they have to investigate, log online and type in my itinerary and you'll see the price is not 20k, what's to investigate???

"540","This rating is solely given for the crew's immaculate service & excellent skills of the pilot's on both to & fro trips We travelled on Suite class on SQ A380 both ways to & fro Sin Ldn about 2 weeks ago. We have also done First Class from Singapore and returned from London in 777 suite pre-COVID before. This review is a comparison for these 2 trips both Sin-Ldn and back. Cons: 1) Pre-Covid FOOD served on Board --- We were extremely impressed with our first class trip from Sin - Ldn. I am a foodie. The food served on this leg was very memorable. We always order the lobster from book the cook because my partner loves to eat seafood and for me I was never once impressed with their lobtser served on their business class normaly. This pre-COVID first class trip meal was the best I ever had on SQ. The lobster was done very well and prepared more extravagantly than what we were normally offered on normal business class. U could tell it's first class with a big difference. Pre-COVID, SQ also offer delicious Japanese Kaiseki Meal on First class which we paired with sake. Really felt like having a Michelin star meal. - Recent trip on A380 suite from Sin to Ldn. Food in the Private Room was good. We had lobster in laksa gravy. The lobster was fresh and laksa gravy was good. We did not eat much because we have ordered our meal on board from book the cook. It was a mistake; we should have had our full meal in the private room before boarding the plane because after that all the main courses quality went downhill. We ordered the lobster and beef from Book the Cook. There is no difference in terms of taste, quality or presentation from the Business Class we flew to France 2 months prior. Very ordinary and was not tasty at all. The beef was overly salted. In fact I prefered the beef cheek I have ordered for our business class to France. Didn't expect the Food on Suite can be so disappointing. Total letdown. The only saving grace was a delicious chinese clear soup served from Sin to Ldn. The same soup was served on our returned flight and was not tasty at all. Food on both return flights from London to Sin was not palatable. The mains were bad and the dessert was even worse. i even commented to a flight stewardess that some economy class box meals on regional flights tasted much better. 2) In my opinion the seat for Suite class is not as comfortable as the business or first class seat. The only plus point is you get an extra double bed if you travel with a partner. To be honest I much prefer a business / First Class seat. 3) Business class 2 months ago- Passenger will not be provided with amenity kit if one does not request. Unlike in the past the stewardess will ask if you would like to have one. 4) Suite class Feb 2023 - There is no lip gross in the amenity bag. Luckily I brought one along myself. SQ used to include little crystal fishes' ornament in the past for your collection but now not anymore. There are not many items provided. So please bring your own. Pro: 1) It's spacious. You will have the feeling that you're staying in a small hotel room rather than on an airplane. 2) Service. i) Pre-Covid service on First Sin- London was excellent + excellent returned trip on SQ 777 suite was forgettable ii) Recent trip to & fro Sin - London on A380 suite, all the crews were very attentive and prefessional. I flew with my partner. SQ has sent an email to my partner requesting for a review but I didn't received one. Hence this review.","neutral"
"8710","Not as nice as I expected & seating issues Even though our travel agent had booked our tickets at the same time, Singapore Airlines was going to seat my husband and I in separate rows. I frantically contacted our travel agent back in New Zealand hoping she could do something but she said it was out of her control. Singapore Airlines wasn't particularly empathetic to the situation and offered to ask if one passenger could swap their seat so we could sit together. They weren't willing to ask others (or demand). Thankfully the person said yes. The plane was older than expected. Service on the plane and the food were rather average.","neutral"
"10290","SQ23 in Premium Economy Solo Seat. 1730 Arrived at The counter. Instantly was approached, and greeted by a extremely professional gentleman, Asking which flight I was on.

Check in fast, with agent verifying information. Boarding was quick. Upon boarding a Red Uniformed Cabin Attendant welcomed me aboard, and directed me to my seat. As I passed others they acknowledged me and welcomed me aboard. One even said “Happy Thanksgiving”. Aircraft seemed extremely cold, and rather uncomfortable. We seemed to be late pushing back, and The Red Uniformed staff was going around talking to passengers. She approached me, and began to engage in conversation. She thanked me for flying SQ for 14 years. Finally we Took off. I had to use the provided blanket. Champagne is back on the menu. When they arrived with Dinner, they ran out of food, so the Steward said he had to go to Business to get entrees. He came back and said what he had. I ordered the Beef. He kept checking in, with estimated time of completion. Constant Champagne rounds followed through the flight. After dinner I slept. Standalone seat extremely comfortable, and excellent value. Second meal came out. I had the Stir Fry Shrimp which was Delicious. Constant Champagne refills continued. On approach to Changi, I switched to Coffee, which also continued with multiple rounds. Arriving in SIN on Thanksgiving morning, crew wished us well as we debarked. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008.

They cannot speak good English so I’m very patient and kind and they always put me on hold for long periods of time and then hang up. I can say, I wish I never transferred my miles to Singapore because this will be my last trip I ever do and I have not even gotten off the ground yet! We are so excited about flying Singapore but after the ground experience I am not so sure that this is going to be as good as we thought? I have the miles and the money but they just want to overcharge me for a first class ticket from LAX to BKK. The system will only let you book the last segment because it is business class so all you should have to do is call and ask to add the last segment at no extra miles but I always want to charge more miles and more money!

"8494","BUSINESS CLASS DAMAGED LUGGAGE London to Singapore our cases came off the carousel just like new (we purchased them especially for our long haul flight). HOWEVER, Singapore to Darwin and the luggage was covered in thick oil spots when we collected from the carousel. It was not easy to find the correct member of staff to explain our horror. When we eventually had a response from Silk Air they offered a 'gesture of goodwill' dry clean. On their return from the cleaners the cases showed obvious signs of ingrained oil and we were advised that two of the cases had been steam cleaned which had resulted in water marks on the inside of the cases. We explained that that overall end result of the 'dry cleaning' was not satisfactory and unsuitable for further business travel. We requested a staring refund for the value of the cases. We had a copy of the receipt of purchase and phots of the cases before and afterwards. This was BUSINESS CLASS. You expect your baggage to not be damaged to this extent. Their reply was they could take our issue no further and their recommendation for future travels is that we may wish to 'wrap all your bags to keep them protected from marks and stains'. I feel their sarcastic comment added nothing but an insult to our ask of replacement. Be warned!","negative"
"8383","Great Flight from Singapore to London The Singapore Airlines A380 flight from Singapore to London, UK offers excellent service and value for your money in Premium Economy Class. The flight staff were attentive, professional and friendly and the long direct flight of 13 hours and 35 minutes seemed to go by quickly. I highly recommend Premium Economy Class for this flight with wide and comfortable seats in a 2-4-2 configuration especially in the window and isle combination (2). You do not have to share an armrest, you have extra legroom and an additional recline angle for your seat that allows for sleeping on this overnight flight to London. The food was well above average and there is a wide range of entertainment options for movies, TV shows, news and music for those who do not want to sleep. For those who do choose to sleep after the main meal and before breakfast, Singapore Airlines offers large blankets and reasonably comfortable pillows. This A380 flight is great for those that have business or tourism in London. Compared with many long haul flights, Singapore Airlines flight SQ306 is one of the better options available and it lives up to the Singapore Airlines ranking as one of the best airlines in the world. It certainly met with my needs and expectations and I would book this flight again. Put it on your list of options as it offers competitive cost, good service and the quality of a first class airline from Singapore to London. While you can ask for a sleep mask and earplugs, Singapore Airlines, should include these for everyone who chooses to fly in premium economy class on a flight of this duration.","positive"
"10353","First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat. The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense.","negative"
"10830","First class from Singapore to Narita with Singapore Airlines. An old plane (compared to the ones advertised recently) huge seat. Very personalised service from check in to the plane. Pyjamas offered on board, even for this relatively short (around 6 hours flight). Book the cook service offered an amazing selection of food, however I chose the inflight menu with the Japanese selection. It was fantastic for a supper menu! The bed is made by collapsing the back of the seat and is quite comfortable. Inflight entertainment was a bit tough (the remote was quite old). There was inflight wifi however I didn't use it. The whole experience is definitely recommendable.","positive"

"2845","Great entertainment but shame about the continuous high pitched whine! Check in was a breeze with automatic machines which give you the labels. The plane, a huge 380 was jam packed, not a spare seat anywhere. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment system was superb, the best of any flight we’ve been on. The screens are very large, and very easy to use, with a huge range of excellent movies. The staff, as usual, were charming and happy to serve you. The meal was better than most, and there were snacks available from the galley during the flight. As an economy flight it was better than most. Our only complaint was the continuous high pitched whine which we believe was the refrigeration compressors. It was very disturbing and made the journey almost intolerable - hence only 3 stars. Even headphones didn’t block the noise out. Apart from that it was a good flight.","neutral"
"6389","Live up to the number one airline in the world I have a connecting flight from Bangkok to Singapore. I was exhausted from the previous long haul flight from Rome as I wasn’t able to sleep due to jet lag. I slept once I got on board and didn’t eat anything on board. The flight attendants were very helpful. They helped me hang my jackets, placed my luggages on the compartment and came to check with me constantly. Will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again. I am not so sure if the aircraft for all route is as dated as the one that I was on. The seat is dated but functional. Well, not a super long flight so it doesn’t matter much. Short flight with flat bed (picture as attached), price is also competitive.","positive"

"2354","SIA demands client's credit card b/4 boarding the plane & AVOID seat 41C or 41H! My client in Japan purchased the ticket for me in August and I flew 1 Dec, SIN to Tokyo. Only 1 week prior did they tell me I needed to present the actual credit card on which the ticket was purchased. This had happened once before but only on SIA. Japan SIA told my client no need to present the card. I tried to verify with SIA in Singapore but they said cc was needed. Japanese client checked again with SIA in Japan... no card needed. Back @ SIA Singapore & guy in charge writes, I MUST have the card to board. Finally, I'm told the client paid cash. AHH...cannot show cash. 6 years ago with SIA same problem and the cancelled my ticket and I had to buy a new one at 3 times the fee from their ticket counter to get on the plane. Never with any other airline and I've flown over 2 million miles, ONLY SIA. Archaic, foolish system. At the airport, no one there to check for a card anyway! Never had this problem with Emirates, Oman Air, Etihad, American, Delta, Malaysian Air, Garuda, Air France, British Air, Namibian Air, South African Airways, Air Israel or any other airline... just SIA. One problem ON the flight. I paid extra for a bulkhead seat, 41H flying out of SIN and 41C on the return. BAD SEAT! The seat selection map shows the aisles are straight. They are NOT. No TV screen in front of me... it's folded down on the side. The aisle makes a dogleg to the window side. My feet ended up in the aisle and I had to keep moving them because the crew had to pull the cart over my foot area and people leaving the premium economy to use the toilets behind me kept stepping on my feet... both coming and going to the toilets. Why pay $32+ to have your feet walked on AND no overhead bin or place to store luggage in front?","negative"
"4236","Brilliant crew and great service. The business class seating is superb. Everything you could wish for on a long flight or in our case 2 flights Melb to Singapore and then Singapore to Copenhagen. We were in good shape when we arrived. The crew were so obliging and the meals superb. Entertainment was plentiful on the screen, but you could read if you wanted to or sleep. Recommend highly.","positive"
"11096","Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with Singapore Airlines (SQ12). A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines. Overall though I greatly enjoy taking this flight from Narita to LAX since the A380 is quite comfortable and less prone to the effects of turbulence.","positive"
"1294","So impressed!!! i flew back a couple of days ago with singapore airlines, all the way from new zealand to amsterdam. I was a bit scared to go because of the whole corona, but was met with such kindness and understanding by the phone operator even before I left which calmed my nerves. during the flight everybody was so kind and understanding, which is admirable because they are constantly being exposed to all kinds of people/maybe corona. everything was thought out off, even guiding us through singapore airport, so that we would never come in contact with anyone who was staying there (i was a transit ofcourse) forever grateful for all the happy faces and impeccable customer service. will always fly with Singapore Airlines","positive"
"10300","No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first. From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time.","positive"

"793","The worst experience ever I am yet to fly with Singapore Airlines as my tickets are booked for October but I can honestly say this is the worst booking experience we have ever had. We booked through an authorised agent and the booking including an infant in seat. We checked all the requirements on Singapore Airlines website and purchased a car sear which fit all their criteria. This was particularly expensive as the seat needed to be CAA certified. We were then notified by SA that we couldn't have the infant with seat even though we had paid for it and even though we had followed their own guidelines. They advised that the infant had to be over 6 months which it doesn't state on any of their literature. SA took weeks looking into this issue during which time my tickets were voided incorrectly causing issues with my credit card. I called 11 times to the helpline when managers promised to call back but failed to do so. The whole process has been a nightmare and other than offering hollow apologies Singapore Airlines have been incredibly unhelpful. I would never book with them again and would warn anyone else used to Emirates or Etihad to steer clear.","negative"

"1698","Old Business Class Product but a Great Way to Fly Singapore Airlines uses the A330-300 to ply the route between Singapore and Hanoi. The interior of the aircraft felt old, Singapore Airlines A330-300 comes with a two-class configuration. The Business Class cabin has a total of 30 seats while the Economy Class cabin has 255 seats. The white-walled Business Class cabin feels spacious and the seats are clad in beige and dark brown, making it look both comfortable and classy. The seats in Business Class cabin onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration. There are two lavatories at the back of the Business Class cabin serving the passengers. The lavatory feels spacious, thanks to the clever use of mirrors in the lavatory coupled with the bright lighting and the choice of white colour for the paint in the lavatory. There are two cabinets on either side of the sink. The left cabinet is where passengers can find handkerchiefs, tissues, paper towels and paper cups to be used with the mouth wash. Beneath this cabinet is the trash can, which can be operated with a pedal near to the floor of the lavatory. The right cabinet is well stocked with amenities. Here is where combs, sanitary napkins, toothbrushes and razors are stowed. Beneath the right cabinet is bottles of amenities such as mouth wash, facial mist, hand lotion and eau de toilette. The sink in Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class is fitted with the old touch button tap. The toilet seat is clad with a leather cover, making it look more premium than those ones would find in Economy Class lavatories. There are a couple of coat hooks on the door of the lavatory. Singapore Airlines A330-300 features a Regional Business Class seats in the Business Class cabins. Each seat is cocooned in a shell clad in soft brown leather, which is very comfortable to sit one, measures 60"" in pitch and 24.5"" wide. The seat controls are in the armrest of the seat, above the storage for the IFE controller. The legroom in the Business Class seats onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 is excellent, where I can fully stretch out my legs even when the seat is in an upright position. Each seat onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 is treated to three window panels. A large pillow and a soft blanket are already placed on the seat when I arrived at my seat during boarding. I find the pillow firm and very comfortable to rest my head. The Business Class seats are preset to four modes: an upright position for take-off/landing or for passengers who prefer to sit upright during meal times; a lounging position which I find the most comfortable for relaxing in when watching movies from the IFE; a semi flatbed mode which I find the best position for sleeping; and a full flatbed mode. The seats are angled slightly in full flatbed mode and are not 180º flat, sleeping on this mode feels as though one would slide off the bed. Apart from these preset seat positions, there are buttons that allow passengers to adjust the recline of the seat to a position that one finds most comfortable. There are two reading lights for each seat in the Singapore Airlines Business Class seats, one on the bulkhead of the seat, which can be turned on and off from the seat control panel; and one inside the seat which can be activated by pushing the light itself. There is no lack of storage space in the Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class seats. Under the IFE TV screen, there are two huge storage bins for passengers to store small items such as phones, passports or compact cameras. However as these bins are rather shallow, it will not be able to hold bigger cameras or laptops/iPads. There are also two smaller shelves between the two seats and these shelves are capable of holding iPods or smaller phones. There is another more hidden storage bin underneath one of the armrests. This bin allows passengers to place their laptops and iPads. This is where the power outlet and two USB ports are located for passengers to charge their lifestyle devices. There are two cup holders between the two seats, which allows passengers to place their drinks without having the need to deploy the tray tables. Seat tables are hidden in between the seats. These tables can be a tad difficult to pull out as they seem to be rather heavy. The tables are large enough for passengers to place their laptop on to do some work. These tables can be slide back and forth, however, to get out of the seat, one would have to put away the table. Seat pockets where the in-flight literature such as in-flight magazine, duty-free shopping catalogue and Singapore Airline's lifestyle magazine along with the in-flight menu, airsick bag and aircraft safety card are found in front of the seat between the two IFE TV screens. The noise-cancelling headphones are also found here when I board the aircraft. There is a divider between the two seats, providing guests with great privacy especially when one is sitting next to a stranger. All Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class seats are fitted with a 15.4"" personal TV. Kris World is the Singapore Airline In-Flight Entertainment System. As this is a rather old product, these TVs does not have touchscreen function. Controls for the Kris World is done through the remote control, stowed on the left side of the sit. Despite being old, the IFE system is still responsive. There are numerous entertainment options on Kris World for passengers on board, ranging from movies to TV programmes to games which kept me entertained throughout the 3hr 30 min flight. Kris World is arranged in an intuitive menu that is easy to navigate through. All Business Class seats come with noise-cancelling headphones that keeps out noise effectively. The remote controller for the IFE is stored on the left seat armrest. The front side of the IFE controller has some quick access menus for flight information, movies and radio. The LCD screen on the front of the controller provides flight information. Other buttons such as volume control, screen brightness control and menu controls are also found on the front side of the remote control. On the back of the remote control are some buttons and directional dials for playing of games on the IFE. There is a qwerty keyboard also found on the back of the remote control, which does not seem to serve any function in the IFE system. Passengers flying out of Singapore (and some other countries) have the option of using the famed ""Book the Cook"" service. There are several options for passengers to choose from. My friend and I used the ""Book the Cook"" and ordered the Classic Lobster Thermidor. Pre-departure drinks are offered as soon as we settled into our seats. The cabin crew came around and offer Champagne, Apple Juice or still water. I took the apple juice. As this is a medium-haul flight, food is served in a tray with a pre-laid table cloth. Cabin crews sprung into action and went around the cabin to serve passengers the appetiser about 30 mins after taking off. The appetiser, Prawn Salad, was tasty. The prawn tasted fresh and the sauce is amazing. Another cabin crew came by with a basket of an assortment of bread. I opted for the Garlic Bread, which is famous on Singapore Airlines Business and First Class cabins. The Garlic Bread is flavourful with the garlic taste not too overpowering. I had four Garlic Bread throughout the meal service. For the appetiser, we had Marinated Prawns with Asparagus and Mesclun Shortly after cabin crews noticed passengers have finished our appetisers, They went around and served the main meal that we have chosen. As I am allergic to mushrooms, which mushrooms are not stated as one of the main ingredients in the ""Book the Cook"" menu, I did not have too much of the lobster. I tasted a small portion of the lobster (and started to get some allergic reactions), and it tasted creamy and fresh. The rice that comes together with the Classic Lobster Thermidor was fragrant. The final course of the meal, Raspberry Bavarois, was served after cabin crews collected the trays from the passengers. The dessert was not too sweet and light, the taste of raspberry was just right. Cabin crews came by to take orders for coffee or tea. I ordered a cup of Latte to finish with the meal. Throughout the flight, cabin crews went around asking passengers if we want any drinks and the drinks were constantly topped up. The service in Business Class onboard Singapore Airlines is top-notch. Cabin crews greeted us by our last names the moment we present our boarding passes during boarding. Whenever the cabin crews interact with us, they will address us by our last names, which makes us feel personalised service is provided. Cabin crews would constantly patrol the cabin after meal times to check and see if passengers require any refill of water. Call buttons are answered almost immediately where the diligent cabin crews attended to passengers needs. Cabin crews are also seen interacting with passengers and taking interest in striking up conversations. During my two flights with Singapore Airlines, I had great chats with the cabin crews. The cabin crews on this flight nothing short of amazing. It is a pity I did not manage to get their names. They were seen helping passengers with storing their carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment, other than standing at the door to greet passengers. During boarding, cabin crews went around taking meal orders in every seat. The cabin crew came by to confirm our booking for food that we have pre-booked our meals through the ""Book the Cook"" service. They were seen sprung into action as soon as the seat belt sign has been turned off after taking off. The cabin crew also checked if we had any food allergies when she was serving the appetiser. When I sounded out that I am allergic to mushroom and my friend allergic to prawns, she quickly checked with the menu to confirm if there are any allergens to us. She came back with her supervisor and inform us that the Classic Lobster Thermidor contains mushrooms. The supervisor also assured me that they will help us register our allergies in their system (which I have tried to do several times prior to departure via the KrisFlyer hotline, which apparently the call centre staff did not do so). However, the mushrooms seem to have been infused into the meat of the lobster, which caused a slight swell on my lips. The cabin crew came by to check if the lobster had triggered any reactions. I casually mention to the cabin crew that I feel a little swell on my lips, she quickly came back with her supervisor to see if there is any help they can render. This goes to show the level of care the cabin crew has for their passengers. As the appetiser on this leg of the flight contains prawns, the cabin crew came back with a potato salad for my friend. When the cabin crew learnt that I did not have much during the main course, she returned to my seat with two packets of cookies in case I feel hungry. Flying with Singapore Airlines Business Class is an enjoyable experience. The good service started at the airport during check-in and continues into the flight. Despite being an old product, Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class was comfortable to fly for Singapore-Hanoi route. The Business Class seat is very comfortable to sit in during the flight. However, the fully flat bed mode was a tad too sloppy for my liking, but since it is a relatively short flight, it does not really matter. There is plenty of storage in the seat that allows us to store some of our knick-knacks. The In-Flight Entertainment system is packed with entertainment options that make us feel the 3hr 30 min flight time zooms past quicker than it seems. The thing that leaves me wanting to fly with Singapore Airlines again is the service that we have received on board. The service was exceptional and the cabin crew was not only friendly, but their caring for their passengers felt genuine. They kept their smiles throughout the entire flight and was seen helping passengers during boarding and in-flight.","positive"
"3933","Where is the usual SQ standard This was a chartered flight by Scoot. Could it be the difference? The plane, a 777-200 was not a modern plane but it's the seat and run down material letting the whole experience down. After few hours, most passengers could feel the pain at the back. The screen was of low resolution and poor audio, connecting by a 20 years' old handset control. The air draft from the top was dry and strong, making the whole trip hard to bear. Service by SQ cabin crew was good though but not the meal. It's hard to imagine this was one of SQ typical flying quality.","neutral"

"5491","One of the better airlines. I have flown with them many times and they are consistently very good. The one BIG negative to me is that they provide the front seats to people with infants to utilise bassinet clips. One previous flight I was in Premium Economy and had a screaming infant directly behind me on the bulkhead, hence I won't pay the extra any more. It is also a dangerous practice as they rows with extra room are those to be utilised in an emergency, for example one exit side is blocked these rows would be the crossover point. The staff are always friendly and efficient and food better than average. With the exception of their bassinet policy one of my favourite airlines.","positive"
"11543","SIN-FCO-SIN on SQ366/365. The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.","positive"

"700","***AVOID AT ALL COSTS*** ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS*** An absolute scam of an airline company, I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st of April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by LYING to me insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for SCREWING UP my booking and LYING to me, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London. Kudos to you idiots at Singapore Airlines for this. My main issues are these: 1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st of April, which I did on 20th of April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer? The agent responsible for this is Shifana Khan, Customer Service Executive at Singapore Airlines. 2) When I called to enquire about the unconfirmed flight change, why did your agent lie to me and say that the original flight that I was supposed to change to was cancelled, and try to scam me for SGD 1700? IS IT ETHICAL TO LIE? Unfortunately I do not have the name of this agent as I was too shocked over the phone when I heard this. In summary, if you want to get overcharged for non existent customer service and want your travel plans to go up into flames, use Singapore Airlines. And also do check out their Facebook page to see a log of unhappy customers who are facing/ faced similar issues as me, who had their travel experience spoilt because of their incompetency.","negative"
"1187","Treated like a King/Queen A trusted source had always raved about Singapore Airlines to me. It remains my only flight with them, a return one in 2016, but I can say the customer service is second to none, and I have Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific top of my list. They make sure you are hydrated and well fed, constantly bringing around drinks and snacks and walking up and down the aisles to collect your rubbish. I had a special meal so I wasn't entitled to the ice-cream dessert for the standard meals, but the lovely air stewardess remembered and gave the spare one leftover to me. Not only do they have metal cutlery, but the air steward I asked many questions to answered them all. Changi Airport is familiar to me and rates highly on my list of best airports in the World and they did not disappoint. Instead of an hour until boarding for my connecting flight, I had twenty minutes due to the pilots arriving late at Heathrow: as soon as we set foot in Changi airport, there was one staff person waiting to tell us where to go and they gave me very clear instructions. I did not miss my flight.","positive"

I must start with a positive which is the Premium economy seat on the 380 is superior to the 777 The second let from Singapore to Perth is a poor seat on an aging aircraft. The main issue is lack of attention from the air crew. You don’t really see them apart from serving meals in Premium because they are attending a large capacity economy class. I have in the past flown Business and the gap in service is too wide considering the cost of Premuim I will not fly Singapore Airlines again but in future will try the Qantas none stop flight from London to Perth.","neutral"

"603","Excellent customer service by LEO (based in LAX - Los Angeles Airport) My sharing was experienced last year, 2022. I just got to busy when I arrived home last October 2022, but then, I feel that I have to be fair and share my gratitude for SAL event though my review is 3 months late. So, bear with me and read so you can decide whether to fly Singapore airlines in your next travel or not. We boarded for our trip from Cebu to Los Angeles, U.S.A last September 3, 2022. We had to fly via Scoot airlines from Cebu to Singapore, where we had a lay over of about 2 hours before our departure for L.A on the same day via Singapore Airlines flight SQ038. When we arrived L.A. at around 9:30 in the evening, we found out that 1 of our checked-in luggage was missing. Accompanied by my L.A. based sister-in-law, we went to file an irregularity report in LAX because none from the Singapore airlines was around that late evening. Honestly, it was such a disappointing feeling for a tourist to miss a luggage and not being able to speak personally with personnel from the airlines. And upon arriving the place where we staying in California, I found out we had another issue with Singapore airlines. One of my luggage got badly damaged and that it was impossible to be fixed. We had to throw it away as it was useless already. Since the luggage that had all of my clothing as well as most of my husband’s, we had to buy everything we needed especially that our tour includes places with different weather conditions. We were to go to Temecula, where the heat wave was really mean. And had to go to Oakley and San Francisco where the weather was cold especially for us, who are used to the tropical weather. At first, I was very much disappointed with Singapore airlines because there was no way for me to contact them from L.A. I had to get help from a cousin who lives in Singapore to contact them. I also got help from my brother-in-law, James, who works at LAX. He found a way to relay my concern to SAL and to connect me with the said airlines. It took several days for the airlines to locate my lost luggage, which was eventually found in Singapore. I learned from my cousin that my lost luggage never got on board the flight I was in. To cut the long story short, my lost luggage was delivered to my sister-in-law’s residence sometime on the 23rd day since our arrival. Prior to that, I have been communicating with Leo of Singapore airlines. He was the person who ensured that I get my luggage back, as well as, be compensated well for my damaged luggage. Aside from my luggage returned and delivered to me, he promised me an extra check-in luggage with a weight of 32 kilos to be free of charged and that the airlines was going to compensate for my lost luggage and damaged suitcase when we fly back home. I was flying back home on Oct. 10, 2022 via SQ 037 with my 3 children and we had free check-in luggage of 23kilos times 2 each passenger PLUS the bonus of 32 kilos that Leo promised me. However, my to-be-checked in luggage reached 10 and all 10 exceeded the required 23 kilos weight. So, I tried to pre-purchase extra baggage via online but failed. I’ve contacted the same contact number I was using to contact Leo but then he was unavailable. It was another guy who took the call. I just forgot his name but he sounded Indian and I’d like to mention that he was quite unhelpful. I am definitely not being racist but I wanted to share that I was one unhappy customer with how he communicated with me. He doubted that I couldn’t purchase extra baggage online. He thought that I was doing it the wrong way so I had to send him screenshots to prove to him that it was impossible. Anyway, he only told me to take screenshots and if I could prove that it was impossible even though I was doing it correctly, then he would give me the discount for excess baggage. But clearly, he doubted that I was doing it right. He probably thought I was that incapable of using their website. When I arrived the Singapore Airlines counter (in the airport) before my flight to check in, I was politely greeted by a guy named Brennon ( I hope I got the name right). When I told him that I was supposed to meet Leo, he asked me if I was “me” (he mentioned my complete name). And then he smiled upon my approval, and mentioned that we spoke on the phone. Just to clarify, Brennon is not the same guy I was speaking to regarding the excess baggage. I actually saw the (Indian) guy in the other counter. (If I remember it right, his name was Nash.) Anyway, Brennon introduced me to the guy behind him in a suit and it was Leo. I was super glad to see the smiling face of Leo. A lady, whom I presume is a co-worker, handed me the cash settlement (for the lost baggage and damaged suitcase) and Release and Indemnity form that I needed to sign. Leo made up for the hassles I’ve gone through BIG TIME. He checked in all my 10 luggage at no extra cost. (Remember, everything was over 23kilos each!), gave us (the whole family) free access to the Star Alliance Lounge, boarded with the business class (It’s always convenient to board ahead of the rest so you get to put your hand carried items on the cabin above you), seats in the forward seat zone for all 4 of us, and 3 of us were in the extra leg room seats (it was like seating in the Premium Economy or even better. I only booked on economy class, just so you know). And all these were for FREE! I could not thank Leo enough for making up for everything. When we were entering the boarding area, I could not help but be teary eyed for all the blessings that the Lord has bestowed upon me and my family. It was a trip worth remembering! We are all so glad to have flown via Singapore airlines. Would love to travel again with them this year. God bless Singapore Airlines! P.S. The amount I received from the settlement? It was an amount that I would always be grateful for. 😊","positive"
"3728","Disappointing for SQ Flew Premium Economy fm FCO to MEL via SIN. Flight No’s : SQ365 A350-900, SQ217 A380. Overall SQ Prem Y class is okay but that’s reflective of SQ pricing which is quite reasonable of this quality airline. Basically the extra $ you pay for is just for the bigger seat. The service is very much still Economy. SQ is known for its excellent cabin crew and service levels in all classes , however this was not evident in premium economy cabin on either flights. Believe Economy crew were responsible for Premium Economy cabin and as Economy was quite busy the premium cabin felt “forgotten about “. Food & drinks was very much Economy class, except in FCO they served a complimentary champagne after take off (but only one glass per pax, when I asked for another glass the crew simply forgot it and when enquiring about it with meal service , they said they could not serve it now only at take off?!) Curtains couldn’t be drawn as premium cabin uses Economy bathrooms so again gave it a more Economy feel than premium. Overall - good price for bigger seat , but don’t expect famous SQ service levels everyone talks about. If you want the big seat with all the bells and whistles - fly CX or QF (but note the price increase)! My advice to SQ - appoint dedicated cabin crew to Premium Economy cabin will surely improve the service and feel of this class.","neutral"
"1773","Best airport deserves best airline Notwithstanding my latest flight on SIA, a review is overdue for me - they have been my favorite airline for about 20 years now. It started with my yearly Frankfurt-NY flights, and I've been upping my quota of SIA flights significantly ever since moving to Singapore. Just about everybody who travels a lot knows that Changi Airport in Singapore is in a class of its own - the new Jewel mallvaganza its crowning achievement, for now - but Singapore Airlines is a befitting counterpiece. Great service, surprisingly decent food (I always enjoy the breakfast), great entertainment, on time most of the time (once I had a long delay and they refunded most of the ticket), really a class act. Can't wait for my July nonstop SG-San Francisco flight and many more beyond that...","positive"
"3902","Wonderful experience This is the greatest airline! Their food is real, highly quality cuisine, no fluff. The staff are friendly and professional. The movies on board were also wonderful. After a long haul flight of 20 hours, we were not even tired. I highly recommend them!","positive"

"11074","I fly for work and do not find Singapore Airlines value for money. Flew from Singapore to Bangkok. The planes are getting old and quality depends on the type of planes. The newest A350 is equally horrible as the cabin space in economy is tightly squeezed to optimise seats for $, but missed out on comfort. The soft touches of SIA being premium such as haagen daaz ice cream, food menus, biz class toiletries pouch or previous-palatable local food in economy have been discarded for margins and this is where I feel SIA have lost their direction/plot. Flying SIA is no longer an experience of delight. One finds too many issues and only is contented to reach the destination safely.","neutral"
"7008","Has the food quality dropped? I must say that we had always been happy customers of Singapore Airlines - although my last review was negative due to a very unpleasant check-in experience in Jan 2018. This time, it was mostly about the food. Normally, I can’t fault the professionalism of the flight attendants. However, something was awry on this flight. We took off at 8.40 pm Singapore time, but dinner wasn’t served until 11ish pm - that’s 3 hours later. After the meal and tray collection, we managed to have some sleep, only to be woken up at 2ish am as they were serving breakfast. The dinner was just ok, but the breakfast was the worst ever - a stale bread roll and a cold muffin. Seemed like a cost-cutting measure to me. Very disappointing in-flight experience.","negative"
"10501","Melbourne to Singapore. First I flew in SQ and experience the lounges in both Sydney and Melbourne this month. I must say it's the worst experience I have ever had. Running out of food, decor bland and functional (barely) at best, staff sombre and angry. It is tragic for SQ to sell itself as a premium airline with such tired conditions. All in all disappointing experience on SQ","negative"
"8501","The Best Airlines We had gone in December 2011, to New Zealand and it was one of the best experiences we had in Singapore airlines. The cabin crew was so modest and caring that they arranged for a vegan meal which was not on their menu. Also if you travel to Australia or NZ on Singapore airlines, make sure you have stop gap of more than 5 hours so that you get to visit Singapore in transit without doing the immigration check at Changi.","positive"
"5523","Zoos needs improving As always with Singapore Airlines everything runs like a Swiss Watch. Aircraft is clean, staff pleasant and efficient, good choices on the entertainment system but the food is not up to standard. This flight has an early lunch, the main choices looked as though they had been prepared days in advance. I think they'd be better off offering salads or even rolls. Food for thought.","positive"
"6028","I Would Travel this airlines even if we never touched down. It is a LONG WAY from LAX to Singapore. But if you have to be in an airplane for 17 hours count yourself blessed to travel via Singapore airlines. I did have the luxury of traveling Business Class, but 17 hours is still 17 hours. The flight crew were so friendly and attentive. I even received a little Singapore AirlinesTeddy Bear when they found out I was going to be a grandma. The seats were superb. The crew made the bed for me when I was ready to take a nap. Lying recumbent on the seat was very comfortable. Only draw back was the leg cubby. It was small and restrictive. If you can, choose the bulkhead seats which offer double the leg room when in lying position. And choose the Book the Cook menu. There are many more choices available. You must do this in advance of your flight. If you have a choice for your final destination, I highly recommend Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"3125","Wow, choose your flight carefully. Excellent outbound flight on an Airbus 380 excellent service and easy journey. Return flight such a different experience. We flew on a Boeing 777-300 it was the worst most uncomfortable trip I have ever had in a Business Class seat. Terrible configuration you have to sit almost sideways and screw your neck around to watch tv. Goodness Singapore Airlines don’t use this configuration you are loosing customers. One guy on the flight said to look around Business Class as it was half empty and the awful discomfort you have to endure for 13 hours was the reason why. Will never fly this plane again, sorry Singapore Airlines, your staff are wonderful, the plane was rubbish!","negative"
"10006","While the cabin crew service was ok my food was rubbish. The first meal was a late dinner and the option I chose was not available on the meal trolley the crew member said she would get it from the galley kitchen and deliver it to me. This never happened.

"5499","Expected More Have always heard that Singapore is the highest rated airline, but we weren't impressed . We had premium economy seats, and the only restrooms were behind of first section of economy, which meant all of premium economy and some of economy were waiting for 2 restrooms. Also, we had ordered meals ahead, as suggested online, but it turned out what we ordered wasn't what they were serving that day. They served us what we ordered, but they were old and dried out. Never would have ordered in advance had we known this. Also, on the way back from Bali to San Francisco, even though we had one boarding pass for the whole trip, we had to get off the plane in HongKong taking all of our belongings, and then go through security again, even though we hadn't left the airport. The premium economy seats were comfortable and the entertainment system worked well.","neutral"
"4215","Relaxing Flight I continued my lucky upgrade streak with a timely upgrade to business class on my flight from Hong Kong to Singapore. The seats were comfy but a little on the older side. Service was quite attentive and the food was delivery was timely and very good. For brunch, the fresh fruit were sweet and the bowl of crunchy granola came with plump blueberries, cranberries and sliced strawberries. The main entree of beef ribs was a little tough but had a flavorful sauce. The chocolate peanut butter mousse was delicious (highlight of the Meal). I enjoyed the custom drinks they served on this flight which I did not see on other airlines. I only tried the Mid Summer Breeze which was a fizzy concoction of 7-up, pineapple, apple and orange juices. Quite refreshing. When we landed our gate was less than couple minutes walk from immigration. By far the best arrival into Singapore to date.","positive"
"5850","Even I was surprised I’d sometimes wondered why SingaporeAir bothered flying between Singapore and Canberra but on my flight there were no vacant seats in Business Class and Economy I’d guess was full based on the number of passengers in the departure lounge. It’s an overnight flight There’s only one meal on offer per passenger but you can choose to have it after departure as supper or before arrival as breakfast. The downside of that is that it limits the potential sleeping time. The cabin crew bustled around quietly after departure but the cabin lights were all on. They came on again two hours before arrival. I reckon I was able to doze for a maximum of four hours. They show a video on how to assemble your seat so it folds into a flat bed. I’ve seen it twice and I had to be helped to set it up and then make it back into a bed. I wasn’t the only passenger in that situation. Seat Guru doesn’t recommend the rows nearest the galley and lavatories. I can’t say was my experience but every flight is different Which brings me to the crew. The “Singapore Girl” has a certain reputation for being cool, calm and collected. Unkind people have suggested “automaton” would be an appropriate description. I don’t think I noticed her name badge but the Singapore Girl who most interacted me did precisely that - she interacted. She was friendly. She actively looked after me. I was pleasantly surprised. Not quite so the Singapore Boys. Efficient certainly, and helpful - but not engaged","positive"

"7383","Beware I paid for a business class ticket. Was surprised to find that there were scoot passengers on the same flight that paid a fraction of the price. Apparently this happen very often. Scoot will cancel their flights when there is not enough passengers and put them on SQ flights. Scoot will give the reason as engine problems but 2 weeks in advance they informed their passengers. They can predict that they will be engine trouble 2 weeks in advance. The same is also happening in the economy class. Wake up SQ.","negative"
"10380","First time on SQ business for a very long time so we were excited to see what it was like especially during COVID. Compared to the Qatar the hard product is not as good especially the Q suite. The book the cook worked well with course by course service with the chicken satay as amuse bush. Meal was excellent by any standard as was the service. Where they went above and beyond was when my 2 year old son was feeling unwell, they assisted more than I would ever have hoped for. Flight was a bit more turbulent than normal due to the different route to avoid Russia and the Ukraine. The flight landed late due to a headwind. Luggage was out by the time we cleared immigration. Only downside was the lack of a touchscreen and selection of shows was not as good as I remembered.","positive"
"7250","Fuel shortage We were due to take off from Changi Airport, Singapore at 23.45 hrs on 31st. December 2018. We were looking forward to possibly having an aerial view of the New Year's Eve fireworks in Marina Bay as the flight took off. However, our hopes were soon dashed when the captain wished us all a Happy New Year as we were still sitting on the aircraft at the departure gate. After another 20 minutes of waiting, the captain announced that there was a discrepancy in the fuel volumes being recorded on board the aircraft and different figures being reported from the refueling bowser. Clearly, no-one wanted to take any chances that insufficient fuel was on board for the whole of our flight, and there was nothing left but to wait until the discrepancy was checked and verified. The airline cabin crew set to work making passengers as comfortable and reassured as possible, and eventually we did get away nearly two hours later than scheduled and long after the crowds in Marina Bay had seen the last of the firework display. The rest of the flight passed without further incident, and the crew were their usual serene selves as they served food and drinks etc. The arrival at Heathrow was eventually was just about an hour later than scheduled as some time had been made up in the flight time. All in all we were on board for well over 15 hours.","positive"
"8549","Premium economy not worth the extra cost We have flown with Singapore in economy class a few times and decided to give the premium economy a try. After watching a documentary on the airline and their supposed attention to detail we went ahead and booked. What a disappointment and waste of money. The short leg to Singapore was fine but the onward leg to the UK and return was absolutely terrible. Broken seat, very little service,entertainment system not working,ran out of refreshments or then just didn’t offer anything,no room to get in an out of seats if the row in front were reclining. When we spoke to the staff they said there was nothing they could do. Not sure we will fly with them again.","negative"
"7091","An airline is only as good as its staff! It really does grieve me to say this, because I am a big fan of Singapore Airlines and a Gold Kriss Flyer member. Unfortunately this was a flight spoilt by the manner and attitude of one or maybe two members of staff. The flight started really well when we were upgraded to Premium Economy. I had flown PE before with Air new Zealand, but not Singapore. We had the two seats at the front baulked (A+C). The first noticeable thing was, there are only three rows of seats (2x4x2) and no real separation from economy, in fact the menu and food was identical to economy. If i had paid the Premium fare I would not have been impressed, there was no noticeable attention, that isn't afforded in economy either. In fact it would fair to say, that there was not much attention at all. This all accumulated when a stewardess, whilst serving my wife and I a beer with our meal, used one beer can to fill two cups and in doing it so fast, it overflowed the cup. I had to hold the cup over aisle before I could place it on my tray. There was not so much as a backward glance from the stewardess. My only comparison was Air New Zealand and I am afraid they left Singapore for dead in all departments, including seat space, comfort, attention, quality of food and indeed manners. Manners and customer service is something I have never had cause to question whilst using the airline on many, many other occasions. However on this occasion it was missing. It certainly won't stop me flying with them again, because a flight is only as good as its crew. There were a few on this flight that i don't think will be making a career with Singapore Airlines for much longer.","neutral"
"10856","Flew Singapore to Bangkok. The flight SQ970 departing 07.15h is during weekdays always very busy as business people are traveling for a one day business trip to Bangkok. Obviously many are not able to book a business class seat due to limited availability. The cabin crew therefore during boarding were busy with those people handing over their jackets and luggage into a safe storage. Even here, all is done with a smile on and on. It is a short flight but I still feel the comfort and great hospitality of Singapore Airlines.","positive"

"2834","Somewhat undewhelmed This was my first long-haul sector on Singapore Airlines in Business Class and I was looking forward to what is reputed to be one of the beat airline experiences in the world. I was somewhat disappointed. The strongest point is the size of the seats/pods, with a 1-2-1 configuration on the upper deck of an A380 allowing for an enormous amount of personal space....probably the most personal space in any airline that I have flown. The service was also very good and friendly, though maybe somewhat canned. Thats about where the strong points end however. The seat/bed are at an awkward angle with the footrest to one side.....its was somewhat uncomfortable to fall asleep in this positioning. My seat, though vast, was very hard....too hard to allow a very comfortable rest. The rest of the experience was somewhat average, as was the inflight entertainment. For sure not the beat experience in the sky.","neutral"

The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem. I got bulkhead seats for the second leg on the A380. SIA do not offer sleeping suits in business.","positive"

"5319","Disappointed...but no real problems I am United 1K, Emirates Gold, and Star Alliance Gold...a well seasoned traveller. This was my first time flying on Singapore Airlines and I’m disappointed. For years people have been telling me that SQ is one of the best airlines in the world, so I was quite looking forward to the experience. Overall, nothing went wrong on this flight at all. However it did not meet my expectations given all the good feedback my colleagues have given me, and I feel they failed a star alliance member who they are expected to provide a better quality service to. The flight was on time. Plane and seats were clean. Entertainment system worked fine, however it had a poor variety of movies for such a long haul flight. There was literally nothing I wanted to watch, which left me wondering how I’m going to pass a 13 hour daytime flight. Both me and my wife were sat next to each other and had vegetarian meals. I noticed they serve all the people with special meals first, and then the rest. I just found it a bit odd that there was over a 5 min gap between meals coming out for my wife and then me. Not really a big deal, but just something I noticed, and something a service industry normally pays attention to. The food was okay. Not as flavourful as I was expecting for an Asian airline. But they did give stainless steel cutlery instead of plastic...pretty good for economy. My biggest disappointment is around the lack of service for a star alliance member. First, there is a 5-6 month ongoing dispute with United. Apparently Singapore airlines are blocking United from having seat availability on their flights...I.e. I could have used my United points to book this entire trip for free, but whatever is going on prevented me from doing that, and I had to pay like anyone else. The check-in agent did his best to give us better seats in the absence of offering any upgrade. Very nice which he didn’t have to do. Gold gets you fast track security, and for others on your booking. Well, not with SQ. I got fast track, but my wife had to go through regular security. Not a problem this time as there were no queues. But what is the point of only some of the travellers getting fast track when you’re all travelling together? By contrast, United give everyone on the booking fast track. We went to the Singapore lounge at Heathrow, and promptly left. It was small, dingy and has poor vegetarian food choices. We went to the united lounge next door instead which is significantly better. Although we had the same tickets, I was in boarding group 3, and my wife in group 6. Again, we’re travelling together and sitting next to each other. Why split us up? Whichever boarding group you give us, it should be the same. I also noticed that they give a lot of priority to their own Kris flyer programme and not much to star alliance gold (which they’re supposed to). So no priority boarding. I’m 6ft3 and I was worried about leg room in economy. I was pleasantly surprised. I had about 2-3 inches between my knees and the seat back. Enough for me not to get cramp and wiggle about a bit on such a long flight. I know for most travellers, you won’t care about most of my comments. But for frequent flyers, the perks of status, make flying so much, a little bit more comfortable. And what I feel is that Singapore airlines treat star alliance gold customers very badly. By contrast, on United and emirates, regardless of the class of travel, the cabin director comes over to me soon after boarding to thank me for my loyalty, and mention if there’s anything I need, just to ask for them...blah blah. Not that I need any of this, but just another example of how other airlines treat their customers better. My wife, who is not a frequent flyer, also said she preferred flying economy on emirates or United vs on Singapore. She seperately said the same thing about the entertainment system. As I mentioned at the start. Nothing important went wrong on this flight. They just failed to offer the perks expected for those who have frequent flyer status on their partner airlines. I wouldn’t go out of my way to fly with SQ again. Overall the whole experience wasn’t as awesome as I was expecting.","neutral"

Why the check in staff decided to put a couple in the center 2 seats of the 4 seat center row, with 2 men flanking us, on a long flight after already being in transit for 13 hours is beyond me. Very difficult to go to the toilet or even move at all. If they had put us on the side of the row we could have helped each other and not try to convince a strange man who cannot understand you or is asleep to let you up. This made a 22 hour travel day a lot harder than it needed to be. Staff on the aircraft could have assisted with the problem also.","neutral"

"5514","Boarding shambles Flew Sydney to Paris via Singapore. In general it was a good flight, although the leg-room in the Singapore-Paris leg (A330) was very cramped. My only complaint concerns the boarding procedures, both at Sydney and Singapore. There was little organisation, and even though in Singapore they called for 'Section D' (towards the back of the craft), nobody took any notice - customers or boarding staff - so by the time we finally got to our seats at the rear, after waiting for all the people at the front of the plane who were loading their hand-luggage, there were no spaces left in the overhead lockers for us. Meals were good for airline fare, but the selection of entertainment was limited.","neutral"
"2289","helpful and friendly services Singapore Airline is Moslem friendly. I requested for Moslem meals when I checked in on website. The food was delicious, the services were great, the toilet was clean and the entertainment flight was great. It's always updated with new movies and musics. Thank you Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"3518","Disappointing! Very disappointed with amount of leg room compared to Air New Zealand who we had flown with from Auckland to Singapore. The food was appalling - I have no idea how they could justify saying it was Premium Economy. If that is the case I dread to think what they served in Economy. The service was not wonderful and the bathrooms were pretty disgusting after a few hours.","negative"
"11374","SQ markets itself as a premium brand airline. My recent experience SIN-MEL-SIN does not confirm this: small seats in economy class food and beverages left a lot to be desired and slow service. The one positive thing I can say is that they were on-time. All in all a poor value-for-money performance.","negative"

"2819","Singapore Airlines to Bali The check in system at Changi was all system based. We did it by our self and was hassle free. Even though we reached 3 hours prior to our flight, me and my wife could not get seats together. May be the seats were already taken beforehand/online. The flight experience was excellent and cabin crew were very helpful and polite. The 2 hours 40 minutes flight was perfect and smooth.","positive"
"8984","Very ordinary business class flight We had high expectations of Business class with Singapore Airlines. Sadly they fell way short of expectation. Our flights from Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to London were very ordinary. We had gone online to ""Book the cook"" and unfortunately it did not record on our booking. The food served was awful - really could not eat it. Staff were good and the rest of the flight was good. There were no little bags of cosmetics or pyjamas as other airlines have. As we could not get book the cook to record on our booking back, I phoned Singapore Airlines in Singapore and asked them to book it for us which they did. Our flights back form Paris to Singapore and Singapore to Sydney were much better, with excellent food and the planes were more modern as well. There was an experimental pack of cosmetics too, which was appreciated.","neutral"

"1697","Comfortable Old Business Class Product, Service is Top Notch Singapore Airlines uses the A330-300 to ply the route between Hanoi and Singapore. Singapore Airlines A330-300 comes with a two-class configuration. The Business Class cabin has a total of 30 seats while the Economy Class cabin has 255 seats. The white-walled Business Class cabin feels spacious and the seats are clad in beige and dark brown, making it look both comfortable and classy. The seats in Business Class cabin onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration. There are two lavatories at the back of the Business Class cabin serving the passengers. The lavatory feels spacious, thanks to the clever use of mirrors in the lavatory coupled with the bright lighting and the choice of white colour for the paint in the lavatory. There are two cabinets on either side of the sink. The left cabinet is where passengers can find handkerchiefs, tissues, paper towels and paper cups to be used with the mouth wash. Beneath this cabinet is the trash can, which can be operated with a pedal near to the floor of the lavatory. The right cabinet is well stocked with amenities. Here is where combs, sanitary napkins, toothbrushes and razors are stowed. Beneath the right cabinet is bottles of amenities such as mouth wash, facial mist, hand lotion and eau de toilette. The sink in Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class is fitted with the old touch button tap. The toilet seat is clad with a leather cover, making it look more premium than those ones would find in Economy Class lavatories. There are a couple of coat hooks on the door of the lavatory. Singapore Airlines A330-300 features a Regional Business Class seats in the Business Class cabins. Each seat is cocooned in a shell clad in soft brown leather, which is very comfortable to sit one, measures 60"" in pitch and 24.5"" wide. The seat controls are in the armrest of the seat, above the storage for the IFE controller. The legroom in the Business Class seats onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 is excellent, where I can fully stretch out my legs even when the seat is in an upright position. Each seat onboard Singapore Airlines A330-300 is treated to three window panels. A large pillow and a soft blanket are already placed on the seat when I arrived at my seat during boarding. I find the pillow firm and very comfortable to rest my head. The Business Class seats are preset to four modes: an upright position for take-off/landing or for passengers who prefer to sit upright during meal times; a lounging position which I find the most comfortable for relaxing in when watching movies from the IFE; a semi flatbed mode which I find the best position for sleeping; and a full flatbed mode. The seats are angled slightly in full flatbed mode and are not 180º flat, sleeping on this mode feels as though one would slide off the bed. Apart from these preset seat positions, there are buttons that allow passengers to adjust the recline of the seat to a position that one finds most comfortable. There are two reading lights for each seat in the Singapore Airlines Business Class seats, one on the bulkhead of the seat, which can be turned on and off from the seat control panel; and one inside the seat which can be activated by pushing the light itself. There is no lack of storage space in the Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class seats. Under the IFE TV screen, there are two huge storage bins for passengers to store small items such as phones, passports or compact cameras. However as these bins are rather shallow, it will not be able to hold bigger cameras or laptops/iPads. There are also two smaller shelves between the two seats and these shelves are capable of holding iPods or smaller phones. There is another more hidden storage bin underneath one of the armrests. This bin allows passengers to place their laptops and iPads. This is where the power outlet and two USB ports are located for passengers to charge their lifestyle devices. There are two cup holders between the two seats, which allows passengers to place their drinks without having the need to deploy the tray tables. Seat tables are hidden in between the seats. These tables can be a tad difficult to pull out as they seem to be rather heavy. The tables are large enough for passengers to place their laptop on to do some work. These tables can be slide back and forth, however, to get out of the seat, one would have to put away the table. Seat pockets where the in-flight literature such as in-flight magazine, duty-free shopping catalogue and Singapore Airline's lifestyle magazine along with the in-flight menu, airsick bag and aircraft safety card are found in front of the seat between the two IFE TV screens. The noise-cancelling headphones are also found here when I board the aircraft. There is a divider between the two seats, providing guests with great privacy especially when one is sitting next to a stranger. All Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class seats are fitted with a 15.4"" personal TV. Kris World is the Singapore Airline In-Flight Entertainment System. As this is a rather old product, these TVs does not have touchscreen function. Controls for the Kris World is done through the remote control, stowed on the left side of the sit. Despite being old, the IFE system is still responsive. There are numerous entertainment options on Kris World for passengers on board, ranging from movies to TV programmes to games which kept me entertained throughout the 3hr 30 min flight. Kris World is arranged in an intuitive menu that is easy to navigate through. All Business Class seats come with noise-cancelling headphones that keeps out noise effectively. The remote controller for the IFE is stored on the left seat armrest. The front side of the IFE controller has some quick access menus for flight information, movies and radio. The LCD screen on the front of the controller provides flight information. Other buttons such as volume control, screen brightness control and menu controls are also found on the front side of the remote control. On the back of the remote control are some buttons and directional dials for playing of games on the IFE. There is a qwerty keyboard also found on the back of the remote control, which does not seem to serve any function in the IFE system. Singapore Airlines ""Book the Cook"" service was not available for flights out of Hanoi. Instead, passengers can preview the in-flight menu from the Singapore Airlines App and order their main course in advanced. I used the app and ordered the Seared Salmon Trout Fillet in Tomato-Black Olive Vinaigrette, while my friend opted for the Nasi Ayam. As soon as we boarded the plane, a cabin crew offered us pre-departure drinks. I decided to try out the champagne. As I seldom drink, I regretted my choice of drink after having a slip or two. When the cabin crew came by to collect the empty glasses and learnt that I did not like the champagne, he offered me Orange Juice or water. I opted for the Orange Juice. As with the outbound flight from Singapore, cabin crews on this leg of the flight sprung into action and served the appetiser about 30 mins into the flight. For the appetiser, I was served the Marinated Seafood Salad which comes with papaya slaw. As my friend is allergic to prawns, he was served with potato salad instead. The prawn tasted fresh and well seasoned. The lime pepper vinaigrette complemented the prawns well. The appetiser also comes with scallops which tasted fresh as well. Another cabin crew came around with a basket of bread, the choice of bread is clear, I opted for the Garlic Bread again. Soon after passengers were done with our appetiser, our main course was served next. The Seared Salmon Trout Fillet, which is cooked to perfection, was well seasoned and was not dry at all. The Black Olive Vinaigrette tasted well with the salmon. I had a taste of the lentil carrot stew which the salmon fillet was placed on, but did not like the bed of black lentils. I had a taste of my friend's Nasi Ayam, the chicken was fried to perfection and did not taste soggy. The seasoning on the chicken was good and the chicken was not dry as well. For desserts, we were served Strawberry Cream Cake, which did not taste too sweet. The cake was tasty and the crust at the bottom of the cake is still crunchy. The cabin crew served me some Latte for after-meal drinks as well. Shortly after the tray table is cleared, one of the cabin crews came by and offered me a Magnum ice-cream she snagged from Economy Class. I would never say no to ice-cream. Throughout the flight, the cabin crews topped up our drinks and constantly checked if we would like our drinks to be topped up. The service in Business Class onboard Singapore Airlines is top-notch. Cabin crews greeted us by our last names the moment we present our boarding passes during boarding. Whenever the cabin crews interact with us, they will address us by our last names, which makes us feel personalised service is provided. Cabin crews would constantly patrol the cabin after meal times to check and see if passengers require any refill of water. Call buttons are answered almost immediately where the diligent cabin crews attended to passengers needs. Cabin crews are also seen interacting with passengers and taking interest in striking up conversations. The cabin crews onboard this leg of the flight provided impeccable service during the flight, making flying on Singapore Airlines in Business Class cabin enjoyable. During boarding, I was hesitant to try champagne, the cabin crew encouraged me to try it out. When he subsequently found out that I do not like champagne after having a sip, he offered to bring me another beverage. The cabin crew was also seen helping passengers with their carry-on luggage during boarding and ensure passengers were comfortable during boarding. The service provided by Lay Hoon, the in-flight manager was amazing. She assured me that our allergies were registered and that the food does not contain the ingredients that we were allergic to, less the appetiser, which Lay Hoon mentioned that she has made arrangements to swap out with potato salad so that my friend can enjoy his meal. Lay Hoon also constantly checked if we liked the meal on board and even offered an additional portion of the main course after I remarked that the Nasi Ayam looks delicious. Lay Hoon brought us additional Garlic Bread when she saw how fast we consume the bread. Lay Hoon and her crew, Museika as well as Yaw Huah, were very friendly and kept smiles on their faces despite having a long day at work. They took well care of all passengers during the flight. I had the opportunity to strike up a conversation with Lay Hoon and she was amazing with her knowledge of the destination we came from and was generous to share with us the work of a cabin crew and some of the plans that Singapore Airlines have when it comes to the upgrading of equipment. Museika was seen patrolling the cabin and constantly topped up our drinks and took care of us very well to ensure we were well hydrated during the flight. Flying with Singapore Airlines Business Class is an enjoyable experience. The good service started at the airport during check-in and continues into the flight. Despite being an old product, Singapore Airlines A330-300 Business Class was comfortable to fly for Singapore-Hanoi route. The Business Class seat is very comfortable to sit in during the flight. However, the fully flat bed mode was a tad too sloppy for my liking, but since it is a relatively short flight, it does not really matter. There is plenty of storage in the seat that allows us to store some of our knick-knacks. The In-Flight Entertainment system is packed with entertainment options that make us feel the 3hr 30 min flight time zooms past quicker than it seems. The thing that leaves me wanting to fly with Singapore Airlines again is the service that we have received on board. The service was exceptional and the cabin crew was not only friendly, but their caring for their passengers felt genuine. They kept their smiles throughout the entire flight and was seen helping passengers during boarding and in-flight. Singapore Airlines truly stands up to its company tagline of ""A great way to fly"".","positive"
"10237","SQ38 SIN-LAX on May 9th on a 359. This is the longest leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight is full, mostly with couples and single travelers. In Singapore there is another security check at the waiting room gate, and most travelers didn't realize they have to go through it to go to the waiting room. Many of the these are the infrequent or first time travelers who don't know that they have to scan their electronics and take off their belts jackets and caps off again, making a long line that moved very slow. Boarding was done by zone and was quite orderly, however there was still a line of latecomers going through the waiting room gate check when the boarding begins. This makes the flight have to leave 25 minutes later than scheduled. The FAs were all wearing masks as per their company's precaution and safety awareness policy. However they were all still very friendly, personable, helpful, courteous and polite, and dedicated in giving their best service. The service started as soon as we reached cruising altitude, started with a drink service then dinner, and a second drink service after that. Many of the travelers are Indians so the FAs quickly ran out of the vegetarian meal option that my Hubby was interested in and he had to settle for chicken with pasta, which is very good. After dinner the lights were turned off so people can sleep, but we were told that snacks is available in between the dinner and lunch that will be served 2 hours prior to landing. The cockpit crew communicated well, explaining about the flight plan before we leave and updating us of LAX condition before our descent. They were very good in identifying possible turbulence ahead so we always get notifications to fasten our seat belts before it hits. Restrooms were always kept clean and the FA frequently refresh them with deodorizer. The entertainment system is amazing and full of latest movies as usual, and it's hard to pick and choose what you want to watch next. As with our previous SQ flight, this aircraft has large 11"" touchscreen with a USB ""A"" that works, and the headphone plug requires two prongs, however it still works well with my wireless headphone adapter which only has one plug. The seat slides forward as you recline so it is a better position to get some rest in a semi reclining position. The lights were turned on just before drink service and lunch was served, and the FAs worked hard to serve us and get everything done before we start our descent into LAX. We arrived at LAX 1 hour ahead of schedule thanks to the strong tailwind. During a bathroom break I casually mentioned to one of the FAs that the day before was my birthday and this trip is to celebrate both our birthdays and our 10 years anniversary. After lunch suddenly we were given two cakes with two glasses of champagne with a ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate, and a card from the crew! Wow, I didn't see that coming! Shout out to all SQ38 crews on May 9th 2023! Thank you for your kindness and gifts!","positive"
"3184","Very pleasant experience, if you can afford it :-( Late overnight flight to LHR, departing Singapore. Krisflyer lounge at T3 was really quite busy for that time of night - so don't look for a relaxed peaceful experience. Boarding was efficient, as always. Flying on A380-800 version 3, which comes with the latest 2017 J seating (see MainlyMiles.com for more details). Business class on an all-upper deck configuration. The cabin is missing the centre row of luggage compartments, which gives the cabin a very airy spacious feel. The seating is really luxurious, with ample storage space and the latest touch screen IFE boasting crystal clear vision for those of you who *must* watch these things. Seats have a privacy divider for the centre aisles, which allows you to interact or shelter from your neighbour. The wraparound wings on the seat give you great privacy overall, if that is your wish. Seat controls are electronic and allow you to configure your seat in multiple positions, including the lie flat position. A pair of noise cancelling headphones is provided. I found the lie-flat seats perfectly comfortable, but other feedback was that due to the slant angle, it was slightly difficult to get a comfortable position. All other aspects of service were as good as SQ usually achieves, but then, to be honest, I am not very demanding there - a friendly smile will tick the boxes for me! There is no denying that the price of business class is high on SQ (very high??!), but if you get the new layout, I think this is a really special way to travel.","positive"
"9681","It gets old... I have been taking Singapore Airlines every time I go to India, over the years I have noticed the degradation of service... It used to be outstanding to the point that you’ll run out of good things to say but based on my recent flight, the magic is gone. Maybe because they get used to the praises that they became complacent. Or maybe, change of management? The flight crews became transactional, the fleets from MNL to SIN and SIN to MAA need updating, the seats and entertainment system needs to be cleaned and sanitized. I am hoping that this airline revives its glory. For now, I am neutral if I will continue taking this flight or shift airline.","neutral"
"10317","Our first flight was delayed more than one hour, so we lost our connecting flight. The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey.

"5456","Exceptional service My wife and I plus 2 kids (5 and 3 year old) had the pleasure of flying to Singapore on flight SQ232 on 10/05/2019. We were lucky to have the new A380 fit out and absolutely loved it. Besides the fit-out of the business class cabin, the Service by the attendants was exceptional. After we boarded and sat down, my 5 year old son asks me ‘why is everybody so nice here’ (referring to the attendants). For a 5 year old to raise this question just shows how lovely and polite the attendants are. Even greeting me by my name every single time. The meals were great as well and there was a wide variety of onboard entertainment. Would definitely recommend the A380 with the middle seats if planning to travel with young kids. Best to stay away from the Boeing 777-300ER though if possible as the middle divider is too high and it’s difficult to access the next seat.","positive"

"10700","Flew with SQ468 on the 27th of November out of Singapore and I was pleasantly surprised! The aircraft was in a top notch condition and the food was by far the best food I have ever tasted on an airline. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and were very courteous. I should particularly mention how they look after toddlers very well on board. Load factor was full however this wasn’t a challenge for the team at all. The only drawback of an otherwise excellent flight was the fact that the entertainments system malfunctioned so much that I ultimately gave up and went to sleep.","positive"
"10659","Singapore to New York. The entertainment center/movies were superb, although some of the plug connections were older, so the voice is low. One time, the flight was making a loud bothering noise, and we were concerned about it especially during take off. The next flight was delayed, they decided to replace the airplane. I appreciate it that they put safety before anything else. The food was satisfying. The attendants smile. They worked fast in getting what the customers need. They are always ready to answer calls.","positive"
"622","The bucket list way to travel As an expat living in Australia for this last 30 years, my wife and I have travelled this route a number of times (as well as many other destinations on business and pleasure). However, we treated ourselves to business class this time, and must say that we were made to feel like royalty. Aside from all the usual trimmings of business class flights (lounge access, express security and boarding), the check-in staff and airline crew were absolutely marvellous and constantly looked after us. Our comfort and wellbeing was clearly their priority. The preselected three-course meals were on par with a first-rate restaurant, and they had a great choice of top shelf spirits and cocktails (which needless to say we sampled a great many). Furthermore, I left my iPad on the final return leg (I blame the 16yo single malt scotch 😊) and was contacted by their cleaning contractor (dnata) on the day of my return to say it was found. Excellent service all round. The only major drawback, is that it is now going to be very difficult to ever do that trip again on economy (as we usually do), now that we’ve tasted this 😁 Highly recommended!","positive"

"4273","Is Singapore Airlines Losing Its Edge???? Not sure if this was a one off but cabin service in economy was always superior to the other airlines food, service. However, on this flight it was clear some of the attendants did not want to come to work that day, one male attendant looked as though he was in a fowl mood and did not smile and was grumpy to traveler. I think his attitude rubbed off on some of the other crew as there was no smile on this flight, most unusual for Singapore Airline. Maybe it was just a one off the flight out was better, however, maybe Singapore has dropped the ball as there fell to No. 2 spot in rankings this year losing out to Qatar Airlines.","neutral"
"7693","Singapore airlines The first leg of our trip was London Heathrow to Changi Singapore. It was a very long 13 hour flight but everything was fine. The food was good and we were offered free wine and other drinks with our meals. Snacks and drinks were also available free of charge throughout the flight. The flight attendants were courteous and friendly and made us feel welcome. We would have liked to have been in premium economy as the seats looked very wide and comfortable but even though we were in economy it wasn't as cramped as with some other airlines. The seat back video screens offered lots of different entertainment such as movies, tv, music and games to keep most people occupied. On the whole a very pleasant flight.","positive"

"5353","Great Airlines, Outstanding Service On our flight from SIN-HKG (SG856), my wife and had the best flying experience we have ever had. We just happened to be celebrating our wedding anniversary. The flight crew on the upper deck of the A380 was incredible! From the warm welcome entering the aircraft to the personalized greeting at our seats, the crew made us feel incredibly comfortable. We booked seats 96D/F. They were incredibly comfortable in the upright and lounging positions, and when both seats are in the “full flat” position, they turn into a double bed. Although we were on a 4 hours day time flight, it was fun being able to lay next to my wife. The IFE system was great. The monitor was large and the resolution was great. The noise cancelling head phones worked well and were pretty comfortable. We both took advantage of the “Book the Cook” items for our lunch (she had the ribeye steak and I had the Lobster Thermidor) and there were both delicious. After lunch we were talking with the flight attendants and our anniversary came up during our conversation. About 5 minutes later a group of flight attendants were at our seats. They gave us a couple of Singapore Air A380 teddy bear, a glass of champagne and one of them was carrying a ukulele (they knew we were from Hawaii). They proceeded to sing a Happy Anniversary song to us, this was an incredible surprise and treat. We’d like to send our heart felt thanks to the following flight attendants, Yong Siang, Alice, Celine, Tracy, Colvin, Jeffrey, Govin, Sze Wei and Mariam.","positive"

I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time.

"7085","Singapore Airline great serviece Travelled for a Christmas break in Singapore and then onto Perth. Flights were all on time. the A380 LHR to SIN was clean and comfortable. Last time we flew we were able to book the upstairs economy cabin, sadly seems this is not available anymore. Smooth flight and great service. Stopover in Singapore was worth it, 787 flight SIN to PER seats not so comfy. On the return journey we went straight though, the 13 hours SIN to LHR is gruelling but service again was attentive which made it a bit easier. We have flown this journey before with Singapore Airlines and would do so again. We booked our flights way in advance so cost was comparable to other airlines.","positive"
"5157","Economy vs Premium Economy Pros: Awesome in-flight service, solid safety records, young and modern aircraft/fleet, clean, reliable and efficiently operated 5-star airline. Cons: Expensive, the huge price difference between SQ economy and the Premium Economy doesn't match with the service/seat upgrade you get. In-flight wifi is expensive and limited compared to other airlines. Uploading or downloading a single picture on Wifi did not work on my 13+ hour flight due to slow speeds. GSM roaming doesn't work (you will know this only after you have paid).","positive"
"4913","Crew service thumb up I will get SQ ticket whenever is within my budget. This round we bring our youngest boy to experience long haul flight A350-900 to Brisbane. We board the flight before other passengers so that we can settle both kids in advance. They did not provide any kids toys for kids at this time. Only one Disney luggage tag on the pocket seat. Our boy feeling unwell when in the flight and we seek advice from the service crew. She is very patient to comfort us and get advice from flight captain. Luckily we can off from the flight. From Brisbane to Singapore, we choose to take midnight flight. The crew give each of the passengers a pouch of amenities kit which include of toothbrush, toothpaste and a pair of socks. Inflight entertainment not good as compare to last year we did take SQ to Bangkok. Breakfast is taste better than previous flight to Brisbane. Keep up the good work!","positive"
"5581","A1Service The stewards on the flight were friendly and helpful. The food and refreshments were to our liking. At no time did we feel uncomfortable, however, the passenger sitting in front of my husband reclined his seat, cramping the space that my husband had available, which he found annoying! When we arrived back in Melbourne still on board the plane, our disembarkment was delayed by 15 minutes, due to a passenger requiring specialist medical attention. At no time during that flight were we aware that a passenger was experiencing health issues. Full marks to the stewards for attending to that person’s needs and protecting his/her privacy, without causing unnecessary stress to other passengers","positive"
"8888","Sydney to Singapore 27TH august 2018 Sydney to Singapore 27th August 2018. Seat:56H Into the tunnel, we ventured that would take us to our plane. Because we required the assistance of walking sticks we were first. Soon as we approached and could see the doors of the plane, we were welcomed by three sincere smiling faces. We entered the plane. My wife and I hobbling along with our walking sticks, following the flight attendant to our seat. ""Take your time please, no rush"" we were told as we found our seat. Not just words, because their careful actions showed they did care. They wanted us to enjoy the experience flying with them. We did feel very special and calm and soon we were at our seats. The flight attendance crew worked as one. They made sure we did not need any help putting up our luggage. We knew and felt very comfortable to ask for assistance any time we required it. The other passengers too began slowly entering the plane. There was no rush everyone knew they would be taken care of. They soon with assistance, when required, put their luggage up for the flight. The flight attendants were always within easy reach. They ensured everybody was comfortable and not requiring any assistance. The flight attendance appeared to read each other minds. Just a nod and they would split into three and serving hot white fluffy towels. A wonderful way to prepare us for our flight. Just as efficient as they were given to us, they whisked them away with the same efficiency. It was unbelievable the flight attendants knew when they were required. Wine! for those interested. Juices, coffee, tea and even water to help us feel even more comfortable with the flight in front of us. Food, glorious food. Prepared in a professional manner. The taste, better than most first class restaurants. The passengers sit peacefully, enjoying the gentle hum of the aircraft, or watched a movie.that was situated at the back of each seat. It is so peaceful and relaxing some passengers go to sleep, covered in the blanket provided to all the passengers. The hours ticking away, most not noticing. The flight attendance shows no sign of tiredness or boredom. They continue their watch over their passengers, like a hen looking after her newly hatched chickens. If your eyes meet theirs, they smile, stop to see if you need anything, and ten continue their endless walk up and down the isles of the plane. Another warm while the fluffy towel is provided, so we can prepare, to go to our new destination. A final message from the pilot thanking us for not causing problems and hoped we had enjoyed all the crew staff hard work, for our short time together. The plane comes to a halt. The passengers slowly find their luggage and line up to face the outside world. LSS Sandy FS Astin FSS Zoe share with us a final smile and the hope to see each other again soon. I believe I could see a tear of sadness on the corner of their eyes. We slowly walked away, saying goodbye to the plane as well, who had taken us safely to our new destiny. Graeme McLeod.","positive"
"5195","Excellent service for a one hour flight Singapore Airlines manages to deliver service in a short one hour flight. Other airlines struggle and take one hour to get food to the back of the plane where I like to sit, whereas Singapore airlines not only delivered all the food quickly, the food was excellent with great flavour and freshness then collected all the trays and rubbish well and truly before the start of descent of the flight. The staff were running around like a well oiled machine as soon as the seat belt sign went off. In such a short flight with turbulent periods it was a great effort, while maintaining friedliness, I really didn’t expect food to be served at all. The only thing was that they can’t transfer points to my airline rewards program which is unfortunate.","positive"

"10220","I flew to Singapore from London Heathrow in economy class on the SQ319 Airbus A380. Flight left and arrived on time. The positives: Flight crew were pleasant, friendly and polite. They still have high standards and give you a lovely welcome when you arrive onboard. Seats were fairly comfortable and enough space to stow your belongings and move around the cabin. Was given a sleeping pillow and a blanket. Negatives: Singapore Airlines have cut the quality and diversity of food and drinks that they have on offer. It was not the standard of food previously experienced on SQ flights. Presentation not good - now just mediocre. No juice, water or alcoholic beverages offered when you first get on the plane. No menu. Toilets weren’t clean and very small. You no longer get an amenity kit with toothbrush, eye shades, ear plugs, or socks or a newspaper. Bring back the hot towel service.","positive"
"10657","Singapore to Denpasar Bali. Early morning departure from SIN at Chinese New Year, so it was a pretty full flight. Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear. So a good economy experience and I guess the additional cost for the flight (as opposed to the budget airline) pays off when something does wrong, as the recovery was really fast.","positive"
"1056","1st Singapore Air flight On SA due to covid rules excluding non-tax from flying on their airline [Im a gold card customer, so thanks] Not bad in any way just a functional cabin, crew and journey. Some airlines and journeys are memorable, however this was so-so really. Food ok, service ok I flew Prem Eco so certainly harder than flat beds for this long trip - but seat was ok not too much of a problem. Bits of tech didn't work though and some things hard to find. The instructions are online - and you have to register and perhaps pay to get online...its all to much of a fiddle so did not bother. Could watch film etc but this must really wind people up who want the full experience. Crew could have been asked and they did change a faulty headset but again it was not a most attentive cabin crew. Perfunctory.","neutral"
"8753","A Harrowing Ordeal of 17 month old's Mother (Business Class) I have been a fan and admirer of the Singapore Airlines for quite some time being based out of Singapore for the past 5 years (KrisFlyer# - 8838199955). However, my recent experience over a long haul flight has forced me to alter my perception of the conduct of the airline staff/the crew as well as the airlines itself. This is with respect to a very unpleasant and downright horrible treatment meted out to my wife Paridhi Gupta and myself while we were travelling with an 17 month old infant. It was totally unexpected since Singapore in itself is one of the most kid friendliest places that I haven been to or lived in. Recently due to business reasons, we had to move out of Singapore and to US and despite having a longer flight duration and a higher premium than the competitors, we chose to book our flights with SQ. We had booked 3 Premium Economy Seats although my son (17 month old) isn't required to have his own seat but for the sake of comfort/space and expected high standards of hospitality we did book an additional seat. Then I chose to upgrade my wife's seat to Business Class using the KrisFlyer Miles since it was a 20+ hour journey that we were (taking not including a layover) and it was suggested to us by the customer service that it would be beneficial since our infant could accompany either of us as and when needed. So we ended up with a Business Class seat (with bassinet) and 2 Premium Economy seats on SQ 326 (SIN-FRA) & SQ 26 (FRA-NY) departing on 16th & 17th August 2018 resp. During the takeoff, we were told that Sparsh (my son) had to ""sit"" in the seat allotted to him and couldn't be with his mother. It seemed unreasonable but regardless we agreed thinking that it is just for the takeoff as we had been repeatedly assured in my conversations with the customer service that my son could be with his mother as and when reqd over the entire journey (Hence the reason for the bassinet seat allocated to her). Soon after takeoff, we wanted to put Sparsh to sleep and for that it was essential that he was with his mother but Paridhi was refused to take Sparsh to her seat for a nap as it would be against the airline ""policies"" and it would disrupt the ""ambiance/atmosphere"" or ""travel experience"" for the other business class passengers. Our request was to allow him with my wife only for his nap/sleep so that they both could rest and sleep peacefully and we had assured the cabin crew that once awake he will be returned to the premium economy cabin and be with me while awake and ""noisier"". Despite repeated request and my son getting crankier by the minute due to lack of sleep, he was not allowed to be with my wife. At each and every step, my wife was made to feel as if she didn't belong to the ""Business"" class and we should have booked the seats together to avoid the situation and as a result she felt embarrassed and humiliated. Some of the reasons given to us for disallowing Sparsh to be with my wife were 1. Policy#1 - His ""seat"" is in Premium Economy and hence he cant travel business. Really? These rules are applicable for a 17 month old infant? 2. Sparsh would disrupt the ""ambiance/atmosphere"" of the business cabin 3. Our Business Class passengers will be disturbed by any potential ""noise"" made by Sparsh. a) Wasn't my wife also a part of the elite business class group, even though she might have gotten her ticket by miles instead of cash? That shouldn't matter in any case. b) Sparsh was well behaved and friendly and even amused most of the passengers. None of the passengers ever complained to our knowledge or to the crew's knowledge which they admitted when asked if they had indeed received any complaints about a young infant being present in the business class cabin/area 4. Policy#2 - The crew wasn't given any knowledge of an infant and they did not have his name ""tagged"" to the bassinet, and hence he could not be given the bassinet and hence could accompany my wife. 5. Policy#3 - Only Adults can switch seats (I could switch seats with my wife) but seats cant be switched between an adult and a kid. (The suggestion in itself was absurd so there was no ""switching"" involved. Sparsh could wither with me or my wife as he definitely cant be left unaccompanied) Twice, I left my son with my wife to be fed and put to sleep, but she was approached by the crew cabin within minutes (disrupting Sparsh's light sleep in one instance) and was rudely asked to take Sparsh and go back to his seat. In the end, my wife sorely dejected and stressed out because of this whole experience decided to give up her seat and complete the first leg of the journey with me. Things continued to go downhill on the second leg of our journey (FRA - NY). We made sure to request the ground staff at Frankfurt airport to clearly convey the situation to the cabin crew so that he could be allocated a bassinet but we were told that this decision was solely up to the discretion of the flight crew. This happened despite the crew aboard SQ 326 assuring is that they will forward our request to SQ 26 about the bassinet so that we don't face the same ""issues"" The crew for SQ 26 seemed well mannered but were very aggressive at the same time in letting us know that in no circumstance Sparsh could be allowed in Business Class since he had his own seat in PE. I can't help but make a note that both the legs of the journey were during the day which was intentional on our part so as to not inconvenience our fellow passengers during the night/sleep time, so the question/point about disrupting the ambiance of any area of the flight becomes downright absurd. We had also let the cabin crew in both flights know that in case they received a single complaint from any of the passengers regarding our son we were more than willing to talk to the concerned passenger(s) and addressing their complaints. At the last 20 mins of the flight to NY, we were ""allowed"" to be seated in the business class so that we can be together while de-boarding. While this gesture is appreciated, it simply cannot make up for the harrowing experience we faced as a family. Sorely disillusioned and disappointed, we have vowed not only to never travel by SQ ever again but also the elite ""Business Class"" and also will ensure to create awareness amongst our friends with young kids to be careful while planning to travel with SQ. The whole reason of this email nearly a month after our ordeal is to let the management know of the ground realities and hopefully this leads to a discussion and relaxation of any such rigid policies which could lead to a pleasant experience for travelers especially if a separate seat for an infant has been bought by naive parents. It just feels counter-intuitive that buying a separate seat for Sparsh led to this highly harrowing time for my family, whereas if we had chosen to stick with just 1 seat each for my wife and myself, things might have been simpler. What also struck was the inexplicable attitude of the crew, when dealing with us and refusing to accept the logic for our arguments that if a) being an infant (<2 Yrs old) Sparsh wasn't mandated to have his own seat and would have been travelling with his mother had we opted not to buy a separate seat for him and b) trying to convey to us that even they understood our predicament their hands were tied due to to airline policies. I do hope this is taken as a constructive criticism and some steps our taken to improve the policies as well as the hospitality shown by the crew to not only with families with young kids but all travelers with different circumstances.","negative"

"2824","A game of two halves We have flown Singapore Airlines many times and think is a great airline. This review is about the first and last legs on a trip to the Maldives via Singapore . We went Premium Economy and were fortunate to be upgraded to Business Class on the return. The contrast between the two Is huge. If you think of the pricing (Premium Economy is double Economy and Business is double Premium Economy), you might expect the value to reflect the same. But it doesn’t. Flights attendants are great in all classes, so it’s not about the quality of service. The standard of food offered was the biggest difference. Inedible in Premium Economy, delicious in Business. Second is the seating for overnight travel. Sort of OK in Premium Economy, fantastic in Business. So, if your doing the Australia - Singapore flight do it during the day and fly Economy. If you are travelling further overnight and can afford it, go Business - if you can’t afford Business go Premium Economy. For all airlines offering Premium Economy, the offering needs to be upped a bit to match the price point. Having said that I’ll opt to fly Premium Economy most times for that little bit of leg room and a quieter section of the plane. Still love Singapore Airlines, just a little (probably very expensive for them) tweak would make a huge difference.","positive"
"1086","Quite disappointed After hearing good things about SA, I must say I am quite disappointed. In all flights, I expected a meal or a snack more. My seat from Brisbane to Singapore was quite uncomfortable. Wifi on the way back didn't work because apparently krisflyers members don't get complimentary wifi anymore, although their app says they do. When I told the crew, they told me the app was out of date and they didn't really help nor offer alternatives. At Brisbane airport I waited 1.5 hours to check in, and the app didn't let me check in online. The app also doesn't really work, it's slow and it's very messy with a lot of hidden pages that are not east to find. Lastly, Singapore airport is so bad. At 6am only a couple of cafes open (waited 25 minutes in a line to get a cappuccino) and not much space to sit.","negative"

In all the times I have flown to Singapore, it appears the airline tries to utilize the tailwinds as much as possible, resulting in excessive turbulence, at least much more so than on United, Cathay Pacific, or the flights to Europe. I wish the airline would take passenger comfort into consideration, and realize there's more to the flying experience than getting there sooner or saving fuel.","negative"

"2351","Disappointed We had high expectations, as I had heard good things about Singapore Airlines, but unfortunately we were left disappointed. We would normally fly Jetstar business class and I wish we had of stayed with them, as Singapore airlines was more expensive. The set up of the plane was poor compared to business class on Jetstar, the toilet situation was undesirable because unlike on business class Jetstar you are only sharing the toilet with about 28 other passengers. On Singapore premium economy you are sharing it with the whole plain. The service was poor. We we not offered refreshments prior to take off and I imagine this was because of the layout of the plane. When we were offered refreshments and food it took forever for the flight attendants to come round and collect the rubbish and empty trays. Overall I would rate Singapore Airlines as poor and would not fly with them again, and I definitely would not recommend them.","negative"

"10998","Melbourne to London via Singapore. If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long.

"4701","very disappointed and unhappy The flight between Brisbane to Singapore:The plane was a newer model, good size screen and phone charging through usb, however internet was not available and if it was available it was at a cost. Have used Turkish Airlines and Emirates previously and they provide free internet. Food was terrible and i ended up getting diarrhoea from it. To top it up my connecting flight to Istanbul delayed for 3 hours. The plane Singapore Airlines decided to designate for an 11 hour non stop flight to Istanbul from Singapore, was like an ancient plane and an embarrassment to Singapore Airlines. I could not believe the how overrated they are. There was no mobile phone charging available, tv screens were old and not working, smaller toilets in size. It was an old plane. The funny thing is the plane that i traveled in from Brisbane to Singapore was a much newer and comfortable plane and the travel time is about 8 hours, however Singapore to Istanbul takes about 11 hours to fly and they make their customers travel in a crappy old plane for that long. I do not understand their logic. I thought coming back to Australia, Singapore Airlines would have some sense and logic but unfortunately they do not seem to have one as they have done the same thing by putting the same model of plane to the same destination. 11 hours of torture with no internet or even a phone charging socket. Also in my return trip between Istanbul and Singapore i was not happy with one of the flight attendants which i ended up complaining to the supervisor during the flight. To sum it up, i have always liked Singapore Airlines and had good experiences with them, however this trip was very disappointing.","negative"
"10408","I am very disappointed with Singapore Airlines (SQ) which claims to be the World’s Best Airline. Paid the high price and full fare for the First-Class ticket and was refunded only 29% of the full fare without giving the passenger a chance to confirm/consent to the refund amount. Very poor customer service and communication. March 23, 2020: SQ emailed me that my flight was cancelled due to Covid-19 situation. April 5: I wrote back ""I would like to get a refund for my ticket. Pls revert."" My intention was to ask what was the refund amount and was expecting them to revert. April 7: No response from SQ so wrote asking a few questions about the refund process. April 14: SQ unilaterally refunded the ticket without confirming the amount. As a First-Class passenger and there are only 4 first class seats on the flight to LAX, SQ could, in the very least, confirm with me the refund amount and obtain my consent before refund. And after I disputed the refund amount as being unreasonably low (not enough for me to buy another one-way first-class ticket back), they should have the courtesy to handle the communication with the customer better and in a more timely manner. So, I have requested for a reinstatement of my ticket instead of the refund on by emailing and calling customer service of SQ on June 5 and got a reply on June 30 that still under investigation. Current status as of Aug 20, it has been one and a half months and still no reply from SQ.","negative"

Flight was good and managed to get a few hours sleep (guess I was very tired). Book the cool meals out from Singapore was definitely a good choice, and the ability to view the standard menu prior also does help. Using book the cook service, I selected Nasi Biriyani and Nasi Lemak and the former smelled really fragrance and tasted really good. Something about SIA premium economy seats in which I can't pinpoint out that isn't very comfortable in some ways.","positive"
"420","Excellent Flight on Singapore Airlines Medium Haul Business Class product Singapore Airlines A350-900 medium-haul aircraft is fitted with two cabins with 40 Business Class seats and 263 Economy Class seats. The 40 seats in Business Class are split into two sections, with 28 seats in the forward cabin, the larger cabin and 12 seats in the smaller rear cabin. The 1-2-1 seat configuration in Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class product gives all passengers direct aisle access. There are three lavatories, one located up front right behind the cockpit and another two between the two Business Class sections, serving all 40 passengers in Business Class. Singapore Airlines differentiates its Business Class lavatories from Economy Class by fitting them with brown leather backsplashes on the bulkhead. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines that packs its lavatories with amenities for guests’ convenience. Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats have a seat pitch of 60″ and measure 28″ wide, providing its passengers with excellent legroom and enhanced privacy despite not having a door, thanks to the cacoon seat design. Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats feature a 180° lie-flat bed. The seats come with several handy modes programmed into the seat control buttons on the side of the seat. Besides the seat controls, Singapore Airlines also included light controls and attendant call buttons on the touch-panelled seat control buttons. pops out in its storage mode, which is half the size of the table. Passengers who do not need the large table can use it in its storage mode. The seat table folds out to its dining mode, which is twice the size of its storage mode. The seat table does not feel wobbly and is perfect for dining and working on a 16″ laptop. Under the IFE screen is a footwell, which is meant for passengers to stretch their feet into when the seat is deployed in its bed mode. Singapore Airlines fully used the space under the footwell by leaving it empty to double up as a space to stow carry-on or for passengers to place their shoes. There is no lack of storage space on Singapore Airlines’ regional Business Class seats. There is a small cabinet at the side of each side for passengers to stow smaller items like mobile phones and passports. The small sliding door installed at the cabinet ensures the items inside remain secure and out of sight. Within the cabinet, passengers can find an international power socket and two USB charging outlets, making it very convenient for passengers to get juice for their devices. A hook next to the cabinet creates space for passengers to hang the headphones provided by Singapore Airlines when not in use. Singapore Airlines designed the space by the cabinet as a side table, which doubles up as a cocktail table, for passengers to place small items on. I thought the biggest flaw with the Singapore Airlines regional Business Class seats was the placement of the seat pocket. The seat pocket is placed at the lower corner of the seat on the back of the seat in front. Passengers wanting to access the seat pocket must unbuckle their seat belts and stretch for it. The seat pocket seems to be meant only for Singapore Airlines to place in-flight magazines and safety cards as it is too shallow (and tight) to fit in anything else. Singapore Airlines fits its Business Class with a large 18″ LED touchscreen TV. The LED TV can be tilted downwards so passengers can still watch the numerous options on KrisWorld lying down on the flatbed mode of the seat. The entertainment options on KrisWorld are laid out in an intuitive menu for passengers to browse and select from hundreds of shows, from the latest blockbuster movies to TV shows and even games. KrisWorld can be accessed via the touchscreen function on the TV or via the mobile phone, like IFE controller found under the seat controls at the side of the seat. Singapore Airlines supplies noise-cancelling headphones to its Business Class passengers. These headphones effectively cancel out the ambient noise from the aircraft cabin and are comfortable to put on. Business Class passengers are given free wifi to use onboard. Singapore Airlines does not offer its signature “Book the Cook” service for flights originating from Bangkok. I opted for the Indonesian Fried Rice, while my friend chose the Pan Fried Salmon. Of the three courses of the meal served, I thought only the appetiser was tasty. The Indonesian Fried Rice I had was disappointing in taste and presentation. I thought the presentation of the meal did not enhance its appetising appeal, the fried rice looked haphazardly splattered on the china, and the vegetables looked like a mess. The grilled chicken tasted blend, the fried rice tasted like plain steamed rice, and the vegetable was overpowered with spiciness. The sticky pudding dessert looked like some mouldy bread, but I tasted the dessert nonetheless. The pudding was too sweet for my liking that I had to wash the taste with Coke. My friend also commented the Pan Fried Salmon he opted for tasted bland and dry. Service on Singapore Airlines Business Class was exceptional. The excellent service started the moment I boarded the aircraft. Cabin crew offered me pre-departure drinks, introducing Singapore Airlines’ latest cocktail, Bellini. When told I do not drink too much, the cabin crew offered me another glass of orange juice in case I was not too fond of the cocktail. Before taking off, the cabin crew – Stephanie stopped by every seat under her charge to introduce herself to all the passengers she would be taking care of during the flight. Despite a full flight, I find cabin crews onboard made an effort to check in with passengers if we required anything else. Towards the end of the flight, a passenger sitting across from me started to make noise about the requirement to submit an online arrival card in Singapore. He kicked up a ruckus that the ground staff did not inform him of this requirement. Instead of brushing him aside, I witness Stephanie patiently helping the passenger fill out an online form while her colleagues stand in for her to conduct pre-landing checks. I overheard Stephaine volunteering to share her mobile data with him when we landed to ensure the passenger could enter Singapore smoothly. Despite it being the passenger’s fault for not checking the immigration requirements, Stephaine handled the situation with much patience and professionalism.","positive"
"3883","very memorable flight for my infant grandson We booked a SQ flight to Bangkok in July and was pleasantly surprised that we get to choose the seat as a whole family travelling with the infant. However, when we wanted to check in for the flight back to Singapore, was shocked to find out the all the family members were separated with only the infant and the father alone. Managed to get in touch with the Singapore airlines office in Singapore and was relieved to find out that the seats has already been allocated to us by default. The whole team on both flights were very helpful and pleasant. The seats and bassinet provided were very comfortable. It was a very smooth and memorable flight from Singapore to Bangkok and from Bangkok to Singapore and my grandchild definitely has a very wonderful first time experience on board Singapore Airlines. Thank you very much for your wonderful service!","positive"

"9002","Great customer service The crew on this flight couldn't have been more accommodating. My husband had an issue with his screen and everyone did their best to resolve the issue. They rebooted the system at least 4 times to try and make it work, but to no avail. We think the actual handset had been compromised on a previous flight. As a result we were served breakfast prior to other flyers, offered additional drinks, reading material and many apologies. Towards the end of the flight my husband was also given a voucher as compensation for the lack of provision of the in-flight entertainment. We thought this was amazing service as they couldn't offer a seat change together as the flight was too full so this was a great gesture to receive which pre-empted the possibility of a complaint. Sometimes system failures cannot be helped. It is service that makes a difference and the way the Singapore airlines staff handled this was exceptional. Would definitely recommend flying with them","positive"
"11630","AMS-SIN-CGK. Flight was on time. Arrived at Singapore Changi airport on time nice airport for transit. Aircraft from AMS-SIN was refitted B777-200ER. which is quiet old but clean nice and comfortable (use 3x3x3 configuration). Staff on both flights were attentive they also offered drinks every several times. However the LCD screen for the entertainment is quite old so the resolution of the screen wasn't really clear.","positive"
"10567","Los Angeles to Singapore, 16.5hrs overnight. 2 adults, 3 children (7yrs, 5yrs and 8 months old) at gate \i am told that the entertainment system does not work. 4 rows of seats are not working. in flight for 16.5hrs, no lights as windows required to be shut, no lights on the seats, not charger for phone, no entertainment, they offered me to move my 2 kids to the back of the airplane so they can watch movies, I guess they have no children. then offered me ~$110 USD voucher to use on the flight for the inconvenience. I had to play with my kids, draw and color using my phone flashlight, my wife feeding my 8mths old with her phone flashlight. This was Premium Economy seats that do not cost few dollars?? I complained and their response was, ""you received a voucher for the inconvenience and you rejected the two available seats."" I understand some issues are out of their control such as the system not operating but a $110 for the inconvenience, also, on the way back, our system works, but other passengers experience the same. Completely disappointed with Singapore Airlines Customer Relations. Will not travel with them again.","negative"

"6138","Flying to Melbourne Whats the problem with flying to Australia? There were no food Menus or bottled water when we boarded. We had no idea what the food was going to be until they came round.No amenity pack. When i compare Singapore to Air New Zealand, they have a long way to go. Air New Zealand have toilets close to Premium for our use. Singapore's Premium toilets were way down in Economy. The toilets were old and became dirty very quickly. When I pay for Premium, I expect to get it, on every flight. Singapore has been our Airline of choice for a long time. What do we do, use a different airline to Singapore and then travel with them? Perhaps, just change Airlines. We simply love Singapore, but there are other Airlines.","neutral"
"2871","Still the best! I was actually longing to travel with Singapore Airlines since the first time I flew with them a few years ago.

The flight attendants couldn’t do enough for you which made the flights that I was on my own on, that bit easier. I was able to select my seat way in advance to put my mind at ease and all the processes were easy. Inflight entertain was relatively up to date and the plane was kept clean the whole time.","positive"
"4251","First travel on Singapore Airlines Me and my husband were travelling to Singapore to his cousins and decided to take Singapore Airlines as we had heard so much about the service. Must say the service was definitely better than other airlines I have travelled with so far. But in my mind it was close to what Jet Airways used to offer in its good days :) The leg room was amazing; you wont get this in any other airline today. The food selection was good in general, but limited for vegetarians. The hostesses were polite and quick to service. However, the headrests were really bad; you can keep adjusting it to your head and after a few minutes it returns to its original shape. So they were essentially useless. On our return journey the seats were not as comfortable and were stiffer. Also, there was just too much turbulence during the journey so I don't think I was able to focus on the finer details.","neutral"
"5381","On time and safe Whenever I travel, SQ is always my 1st choice of Airline; the plane is new, on time schedule and good service. Online booking of SQ flight and online check-in process is easy, inflight entertainment is great too. Highly recommended. :)","positive"
"11021","My friends and I flew Singapore Airlines from Manila to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore last week for a holiday. From updating a companion's passport details through their reservations line in Manila to the orderly boarding procedure, one gets a sense of the quality. The meals, particularly the pork pasta dish served on the Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore sector, were divine. The frequent drinks run was very highly appreciated. The cabin staff were efficient and effective, particularly with regard to safety, with polite but firm requests to stow bags and trays when necessary. The Boeing 777-200 is on the senior side with a minute screen but the A330-300 on the SIN-SGN vv. route is another story.","positive"

Most importantly we had a safe flight and had never doubted taking our home brand anytime.","positive"

"8676","BOOKING EXPERIENCE With all the technology at disposal in Singapore Airlines. The one thing SA could simply not get right is a non- functional website. Your booking engine sucks, redemption online is a complete disgrace, doesnt allow passengers to book redemption only over the phone, had to call singapore, because there was no official office in UAE, although they have a third party who has no control over redemption (krisflyer.) Even the worlds worst low cost carrier probably has a better user-friendly website. Calls for some IT dept ovehaul. Website always crashes, payment system doesnt work. And no one can explain, and give answers. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE. THANK YOU, HAVE BURNT THROUGH ALL THE MILES. NEVER WILL I GIVE ANOTHER PENNY TO SA FOR THEIR CRAPPY SERVICE.","negative"
"11381","Return trip to Adelaide via Singapore. Would not use this airline again nor would I recommend travelling with Singapore Airlines. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped extremely poor inflight entertainment the food was an ice cream dessert that was still frozen and inedible. One of the meals contained pork so tough I could not cut through it. Another meal that was supposed to be beef just consisted mainly of gristle. The only good part of all four flights was that most of the cabin staff were efficient and helpful. I found the whole experience extremely disappointing and certainly poor value for money.","negative"
"2825","Enjoyable Business Class Experience Osaka to Singapore A relatively short but enjoyable overnight flight. Check-in only starts around 2.5hrs before departure. For business class passengers, you get a choice of using either the JAL Sakura Lounge or some restaurants as the lounge gets very crowded with a couple of airlines using it. However, I don't think a crowded lounge is of any big issue to me as long as I can get a seat, in which mostly, people do. Offerings wise quite standard but not too bad overall. Three different type of beers available and spirits and Japanese plum wines. As having been on the Dreamliner several times in business, hence, seat is pretty good as usual. As flight time is only around 6 hours and they offer a sleeper service in which you can have your meal either after take off or 2.5hrs before touch down in which they will wake you up. I selected right after take off and had the hot soba with tempura, changing from the famous Hanakoireki as the outbound from SIN didn't taste as good as expected. The soba definitely tasted very good. Something happened just before meal service (I will not say it..haha) but as a result, chatted with the crew, the IFM Ms. E. Chan whom was really amazing. She is probably the second best ever SIA crew I ever encountered and ask her about the sleeper service as it did say passenger can choose to have a meal after take off or 2.5hrs before landing or both. I asked how does 'both' works and she say if there are remaining, they will try to serve passenger requesting for second, but she say will wake me up for the second meal. Second time round try the Hanakoireki and it certainly tasted much better than the outbound from SIN one, and being a supper service, it was half the portion which was just enough.","positive"
"8476","Excellent Service from Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines continues to provide an excellent service. They also allow an unbelievable 30kg of luggage per passenger in economy.

"1920","Delightful inflight experience from SQ Given the on-going outbreak of Corona Virus, I salute those crews who still showed up to work on a flight some crews may consider ""sensitive"" for various legitimate reasons. Those cabin crews in this particular flight worked very well, supporting each others' tasks, with impeccable attention to details throughout the flight. A special shout out to one of the Cabin Crew, Yan Ting LAM, for the most courteous service, delivered with genuine care and concern for her passengers. It's staff like Ms LAM and others like her that truly set SQ apart from others.","positive"

"10530","Singapore to Melbourne. I have taken SQ many times and each time is a little worse than the flight before. This flight was on time and passengers were boarded according to section. I was lucky that there was a spare seat between myself and the guy with the aisle seat. Once we took off, the passenger in front reclined (day flight) and it sure makes economy feel so squeezy. Unlike their promise on the website that you won’t be packed like sardines, you are. I can’t eat fish but I guess SQ decided to save money by incorporating all allergies. My breakfast was gluten free (revolting hard dry roll), no dairy and no sugar. I was appalled by it compared to the normal breakfast. I am glad I brought snacks like chocolate and cookies. The selection of entertainment was fine and the toilets are kept clean. However paying so much more to go with SQ I expected the standards to be maintained not reduced. I think I will only base future travel on price as this so called great airline is not so great.","negative"

"685","Not what I expected Having only flown charter or budget airlines we were excited to fly on this renowned airline. Was left dissapointed to be honest. The seats weren't very comfortable and less room than Thomas Cook or Tui in long haul. The food was hit and miss. Some OK some absolutely disgusting, with fish bones and scales in a meal described as chicken. Getting water was a chore and served in thimbles. Worrying on a 13 hour flight. Had no idea until near the end of a 13 hour flight that you could request snacks and alcohol (as none offered) from back of plane but pretty poor selection. IFE system very poor, irritating to navigate and poor selection. Games didn't work on any of the 4 legs we had. Again, much better selection on the cheap charter airlines. Only positives were the short legs from Singapore to siem reap and back. Much better service, same size seats! 737 cleaner and newer than the a380 or 777. Also enjoyed flying a380, very smooth flight on such a large aircraft. Would recommend Changi airport as a layover but not their national carrier.","neutral"

"34","Disappointing Experience with SQ We were disappointed with the SQ for the following reasons: 1. No amenities kit for business class. One has to ask for each item ( socks, slippers, ear plugs, eyes mask, lotion……..) individually 2. Only two meals were offered on an 18 hours flight. The rest are only snacks for you to ask 3. Wi Fi were unstable on and off for the whole flight. It’s very frustrating to get any work done 4. Lie flat seat need flight attendant to help set up 5. The “chicken rice” meal I had was inedible. The meat was hard and dry. I guessed it’s because of being reheated too many time","negative"
"4224","The have redeemed themselves My last review was less than flattering because of the bad flight attendant experience I had on the flight from Singapore to Newark. This time the staff redeemed themselves in a very good way. The service was so much better and the staff on this flight was highly trained. The crew worked like clockwork and I was never thirsty or hungry. The attendants were all very polite and experienced. I spoke with the male attendant before alighting and he was very good. Singapore airlines, PLEASE keep these kind of crew on this flight and I will continue to purchase this route and even spend more for business class.","positive"

The entertainment provided did not offer much to suit our tastes. Notwithstanding those minor points always happy to recommend this airline.","positive"
"303","A five-star airline? Not exactly The expectations for a five-star airline are always high and this review reflects our high expectations vs the reality we experienced on our recent flights BOM-SIN-BKK: THE PROS 1 Cabin crew: highly motivated & upbeat. Excellent ambassadors of SIA. THE CONS 1 Aircraft B777W: a noisy aircraft (when sitting next to the engine, 18 A). Avoid! 2 Seat: if you love sitting in an angled position during take-off and landing, go for it! The captain switched off the seatbelt sign 45 min into the flight due to heavy rains in India and 30 min before landing, a back ache as a result. The bed is comfortable, though, managed some 1-hour sleep on the flight. 3 Meal: didn't book the cook. Very spicy ex-Mumbai. When flying a five-star airline and spending a small fortune after Covid-19 for the flights, the expectations are really high. Those were not met by SIA, unfortunately, partly due to the poor transit experience at Changi Airport (i.e. T2 under renovation, T2 lounge poor). SIA seems to be OK the air, but poor on the ground at present (T2 in particular). Five star? No, not at all. The cabin crew are absolutely great; the rest of the product leaves a lot to be desired (at T2 at least).","neutral"
"10500","Singapore Airlines maintained its excellent standard on this 5-hour flight. A pillow and blanket were available on the seat when we boarded. The cabin was clean and despite the flight being nearly full, it was still a very good experience. Furthermore, the legroom of the seat was excellent and the seat was very comfortable. The tray table was wide and sturdy, and there was sufficient storage with a nice pocket for my phone and nice pouches for me to put things in. There was a wide selection of movies available as well. The cabin crew were as usual, excellent and provided great service. A meal service was provided for this red-eye flight, and my Chicken meal was good. Despite being delayed on departure, we arrived in Shanghai on time. SIA’s newest product on the 787 is indeed very well designed and the flight was very good overall.","positive"

A nice touch when a head cabin service officer apologized to me about the delay when the flight took off behind schedule from HKG was due to late arrival to HKG from Singapore. I'll recommend this airline.","positive"
"10664","Kuala Lumpur to Cape Town via Singapore. As usual, they are famous of their top notch quality, service, and efficiency. Crews were very attentive and helpful.

I will choose to fly with SIA again.","positive"
"1678","First Class not really worth the money It isn obviously a 'first world problem', but I was disappointed with the standard of Singapore's 1st class - it was very similar to Business Class in other airlines such as Emirates. The seats were ok, but relatively narrow. While there were privacy screens, you were still very much 'exposed' to people walking by. The work space was quite awkward. Overall it was pleasant, but I would not have spent the money upgrading from business if I had known that it was so much 'lesser' than other airlines.","positive"

"2691","Deterioration of service and food quality and, surprisingly cabin crew a bit rude I have been flying Singapore Airlines for past 15 years and in my recent travel I noticed that its cabin crew professionalism and food quality have certainly deteriorated. I was travelling economy class, the cabin crew banged the food trolley against my knee but did not stop to apologize. It was a safety issue more than a behavioral issue and i assume that the crew was not trained enough to handle the in flight drinks trolley. One of the crew member came across rude, maybe she was having a bad day. I found rubbish not cleaned from previous flight which was brought to the notice of the cabin crew. On the positive side, boarding was well coordinated and flight schedule was on time.","neutral"

First meal served noddles and chicken , which still had the skin on and not good quality . Breakfast was served about an hour before landing and again rushed , noodles again or omelette , asked for the second but told not sure if enough after giving me mine my husband was told because he had omelete that meant one of the cabin crew wouldn’t eat !!

"1990","Two trouble free flights to Auckland We were off to visit our son and grandson in New Zealand and chose to go via Singapore stopping for a couple of nights before flying on to Auckland. The booking in and luggage drop at Heathrow was quick and simple with no queues to speak of, also boarding was organised and easy. The crew on the plane were as friendly and helpful as normal and the food was better then expected for economy class. The A380 seemed to be new and comfortable. Our short stay in Singapore was very good but when i went to book in for the flight to Auckland I hit a problem in that NZ immagration said my visa was not valid and so I went to the Singapore Airline and a young lady there got it sorted speaking to NZ immagration to find the problem then got it sorted so I could fly and I can't speak to highly of the service she gave us. Our 2nd flight from Singapore to Auckland was not so good with a much older A380 plane and the food not to our tastes but the service was as good as ever.","positive"
"8179","The Flight Crew on all legs of our recent travel with Singapore Airlines were exceptional. My husband and I completed 4 legs with Singapore Airlines in October and November. The service from checking in to getting off can not be faulted. One small glitch on the final leg to Brisbane from Singapore. Being in Premium Economy we found it surprising that they were out of a particular meal and the ice-cream when they came to us. As I say, it can be the little things and these certainly were small in the overall experience. Service, attentiveness throughout the whole trip, top shelf. Assistance getting overhead bags organised etc. Best thing - another small thing however in the air for 14 hours also a big thing. The loos were constantly cleaned and freshened. Just lovely!","positive"

The A350 is a great plane to travel on and SQ has made sure there is plenty of legroom, the storage pockets are great for holding phones instead of having just one big pocket. Once again a really good flight.","positive"
"10547","Singapore to London. Incredibly inept Admin. I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding, it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing. There is little their superb in-flight service did to improve the bitter resentment on my part. I expected much better after the initial discussions, I got contempt.","negative"

"6776","Very Good, but perhaps not as good as expected We had very high expectations about going business on Singapore Airlines on a long distance flight. Having read reviews about service etc. Outbound we were on a 777-300 which had very good seats with good storage space for ""things"". Return was on a A380 that was nearly empty and 4.5 hours delayed due to problems with a generator on one of the engines. Seats were very wide with plenty of space (Old business class seats ?) but there was really lack of storage space for books, glasses etc. Foot was very good as one should expect on a business class flight. Vine selection good. Return flight being a day-flight was kept with windows close during all flight. Not sure why. We arrived at Heathrow early evening so keeping it dark did not in my case help on my jet-lag.","positive"

We are very thankful to Ms. Keles and all Singapore Air team. We had great service on airplane for our son’s special needs.

"11349","Singapore Airlines is slowly losing it on their long-haul business class compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. I used to love this seat 7 years ago when they launched it however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories. Moreover the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard as well as during the Tokyo layover with no success. Since the flight was full I couldn't change seats. The food though was outstanding.","negative"

"9750","More training for your staffs please. Travelled with my family to NZ for our holiday last November. The trip to NZ was fine, its the trip back that made us question if we should ever consider flying Singapore airline again. Recently flying SQ we faced the issue of the meal times were always late. This round the meal time was delayed for more than 1 hour, and when the flight attendant was distributing the snacks, I asked if they can spare one more sandwich for my young child, The attendant had turned me down and said they do not have enough food for everyone. For normal circumstances I can be more understanding, however during the whole flight I witnessed the passengers (a family of 3 - parents and a teenager) seated in front of me had been requesting snacks and drink non-stop. If you are worried that you do not have enough food for all, why ain't your staffs trained to turn down the request from passengers that had been requesting food non-stop? And it was my 1st request for an extra sandwich for my young child, and it was due to your delay in meal time. At the end I had to tell my crying child that the airline does not have enough food. As a well know airline, shouldn't you planned and stocked enough food for all? And the attitude from the flight attendants were very bad.","negative"

"4650","Singapore Airlines are no longer the benchmark. There are a handful of airlines operating international flights out of Adelaide including Qantas, Emirates, Singapore, Cathay etc. For many international travellers the arrival of Emirates initally challanged the others and they still do. Using Emirates as the benchmark Singapore runs a poor second or even third. First there is no complimentary home to airport transfer for Business Class passengers, a very crowded and air-less lounge, no complimentary toiletries (other than some disposable toothbrushes in the aircraft toilets), new and very narrow seats that convert to cramped beds and although I didn't actually measure it, less leg room. The menu choices are more limited and quite disappointing, the entertainment system less extensive. The connection times out of Changi are extraordinarliy long (from my experience almost 8 hours for a connection to Barcelona and 7 plus hours for a Tokyo connection) and the Business Class lounge in Changi is not the most pleasant place the spent half a day. All that being said it counted for nothing after I experienced Lisbon to Frankfurt (Bus Class) with Lufthansa; but that is whole other dirty plane and substandard story.","neutral"

"6425","Inconsistent Having flown Singapore Airlines economy class on both regional and intercontinental, and finding the intercontinental sectors superior to other airlines, this is my first time on regional business class. It is a disappointment. At the very least, I would expect any of its products, regional business class included, to be above the average. But I was really disappointed. First, the A330 aircraft is really tired and has to be retired. The cabin looks really old. The seat was awkward and uncomfortable. Only a few channels of music were working, though there were many more video channels. Staff, especially the female cabin crew, were very efficient and incredibly well groomed, but they were very stern and robotic, and gave out a sense of aggressiveness, making them seem unfriendly and curt. The worse part was the food. I can't begin to say how bad it was -- I had booked in advance the lotus leaf fried rice. It was so dry and totally lacking in any taste or texture -- in other words inedible. The dessert of Oriental nuts jelly was also inedible, and so was the fruit bowl, consisting among other things of a large piece of rock-hard green apple. I ended up just drinking the champagne and wines, which were quite good. I had to ask for some other food, and all they could give me was some insipid biscuits from economy class. As for the lounge at Bangkok airport, it was good, well lit, and had enough variety of food and beverages. I will go on to review the return trip, as it was very different. It was the opposite – the flagship lounge was incredibly lousy while the flight hardware was very good. Upon entering the Singapore airport Terminal 2 lounge, my first thought was -- is this for real? Small, dark, dim, depressing. Food consisted of only a few varieties of depressing local stuff. I then decided to check out the Terminal 3 lounge. It is many times bigger and at least had a little natural light, but the facilities and consumables were equally miserable. Singapore Airlines' flagship lounge at Terminal with intercontinental flights, and not a single decent Western item, but only some lame street-food items? Am I in the wrong country? Isn't this the international city-state par excellence? The return flight was much much better – on a new B787 with very private seating and a beautiful large screen controllable by touch. Book the Cook was available (not available from Bangkok) and fortunately I made use of it, for the standard items looked miserable. Singapore Airlines has to do something better for their food. The hardware is inconsistent. While Singapore does a good job for long-haul economy, I would rather choose Cathay, Thai or Malaysia for business, for their flagship lounges are much better and the cabin service more genuine and warm.","neutral"

"2925","Not as good as we thought We flew with Singapore Airlines to Australia in November from Manchester we were looking forward to the flight as we had read some good comments we have flown with many different Airlines over the years I thought that Singapore Airlines would be great we were sat in Rose 48 and the window seat was classed as an extra legroom seat there were two seats in front of us which we're also extra legroom I can honestly say that I would not be happy if I had paid for the extra legroom seat by the window the gentleman sat there was very tall and he looks really cramped and to get out of the seat you have to walk forward the passenger in front did not like this and ask the passenger beside as to not disturb him when getting up and asked if he could go pass myself and my husband this was impossible as there is no way you can walk through so the gentleman had to climb over the seat to get it back into his own seat be aware if you book row 48 and book the extra legroom seats. The food on the flight was nice but unfortunately my husband ordered a drink with his meal he ordered a beer 3 hours into the flight he asked if he could have another beer he was then told that sorry we have run out of beer this is shocking as we were only 3 hours into a 12 our flight and on the way back from Singapore to Manchester my husband did not have a meal as he was driving and wanted to get some sleep then they came round with the breakfast just before we landed by the time they got to us and several passengers behind us they have run out of breakfast and could only offer a beef noodle and did not have any alternative meals to offer anyone so my Husband did not have anything I ask for an extra bread roll this was my breakfast. During both flights I felt that the attendance did not come round as often as they do on any other fly we have been on and for most of the flight going out we were in darkness bearing in mind our flight left England at 12 lunchtime.","neutral"

However, the crew on our flight made extra effort to make our experience as pleasant as it could be on such a long flight. They even found a meal my wife wanted when they had run out of her selection. Happy wife, happy life. Food service included a mixture of oriental and western type dishes. Most was good for airline food. Wine for meals was included. We sat in bulkhead seats which provided plenty of legroom but weren't as convenient when it comes to using the entertainment system or having a place to put your things - phone, book etc. The entertainment system worked well and had an excellent selection of movies, TV shows, music, games. The only thing missing in the bulkhead row was a USB port to charge my phone but was able to run my charging cable to the row behind me.

However, despite a large range of options, either through the normal in flight menu and 'Book the Cook' options, leaving Brisbane at 9:40am seems to have flustered Singapore Airlines and their menu makers. It is a brunch flight, (you are eating at 10:30am), not dinner or even lunch but the options provided were Dinner or Lunch. Ironically they offered cereal followed by steak and scrambled eggs. Or if you wish, an Asian choice. The same problem exists leaving Singapore early in the morning.","positive"

"10235","What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses. Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasn’t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.","negative"

"3237","First flight on a SQ Dreamliner I recently had a short flight on Singapore Airlines to Bangkok, a flight that utilised a B787 Dreamliner. The check-in process was easy and straightforward, with the automated luggage belts working much more efficiently than when I last used them. Boarding was smooth even though the flight was at least 80% full. I was actually most eager on this flight to check out the plane's windows. Designed to dim or lighten at the press of a button, the windows have not attached sliding shades. Furthermore, the Dreamliner's windows are some of the largest, if not the largest, in the business, allowing for an improved view outside the plane. Unfortunately, as the flight was in the early evening, testing of the automatic dimmers had to be shelved. The airline's Krisworld IFE was excellent with a super-extensive range of movies, shows, music and games as usual. If anything, perhaps the only thing missing is a camera mounted outside the plane to allow for a different view during take-off, landing and in flight. Food options were decent although I tend to find that the mains offered in economy somewhat dull, which turned out to be the case again although I was plesantly surprised that the meal came with brown rice, a healthier option compared to white rice. Service standards were also definitely very good. Overall, a good flight where everything worked although it will need another, preferably longer flight, to decide if the Dreamliner's my kind of aircraft.","positive"

"2106","Standard dropped so much! Took from trf/cph/sin&return. It has been years since i flew with SQ (since the early 2000s) so I tot ok give them a chance although their prices are pretty high compared to other airlines like KLM or Finnair or BA cos as a citizen we always support our national carrier. Back then the services were very good but now it's really dropped so so much! See below.. -Preflight- The booking online did not confirm meals for children upon booking only that we will have to arrange it again come 2 weeks prior to departure. (WELL KLM on the other hand automatically register a child seat =a child meal) Then a month or 2 before I fly i received an email saying they hv changed the departure time and that is not good as we had to make arrangements again to ensure our connecting trip timings fits etc. And they said in the mail that we will need to click to agree with the changes as otherwise we will be kicked off the flight and no refunds will be entertained! Well left us with no choice right??! -1st leg of flight(oslo/cph)- Bear in mind cos it's code share, they partner with SAS or wideroe from the leg trf/cph. Sas do not serve snacks nor drinks but on wideroe they serve just beverage. And wideroe&sas planes have smaller overhead compartments so your hand luggage need to comply with their measurements instead of SQ's. But as compared to klm, klm's plames can accommodate bigger hand luggages as their overhead compartments are bigger and they do serve a sandwich/snack+beverage. And SQ's fare is usually more expensive than klm's. -2nd leg of flight (cph-sin) Actual flight was just normal. I like it that they hv 'milo' on request on board. But my husband noticed that the stewardess mostly didn't really know their products on hand and have to always go ask her seniors back in the gallery whenever. So this was some wasted time waiting for a simple question. Example I asked if I can have a silver sling drink but she was unsure and had to ask her senior and had to walk to and fro many times again when my husband asked if he can hv some certain hard liquor. And the amount of hard liquor they offer in the cup is much lesser than what klm offers. And they will take a note (really writing down) of that which seat passenger has already got their liquor. And comes mealtime my children were offered just adult meals and when i enquired they said i had to book a child meal in advanced. I was dumpfolded..klm or either finnair do let u choose when u book the tickets online. But the stewardess was nice though. -sin/cph- Return flight was almost the same service again but this time I encountered a rude steward who is very grumpy. As my children got their meals first than adults, they have finished eating (as it's a night flight they didn't eat much) while he was serving me my meals and I requested him to remove my children's meal tray away and he said he is serving still. But I insisted that he remove it else I do not have the space to eat and settle down my children at the same time. He relented but very apparently annoyed as he just took the tray from me and walked all the way back to the gallery. Is this service?? -others- The children activity kit that SQ gives out now is pathetic. Just some random not good quality colouring set with very very thin tracing paper.. Klm on the other hand gave out a comprehensive children activity set which included child eye shade, klm colouring pencils/cardboard print, tic tac toe games, card game set, amongst other things I forgotten in a felt bag.","negative"

Best thing was to fly through the day & get a good sleep then head off following morning - we landed in Male refreshed ready for our Island adventures !! Flying on the afternoon flight with great headsets and exit row and fab movies with a stop over @ the Crown attached to the airport in Singapore was just the best and I have to say the biggest thank you all the air hostesses and especially to - FSS Ismar Nurlinda Binte Omar (Linda ) on SQ 431 MLE- SIN on 30/08/23 who went above and beyond giving us business class care in our economy seats!! ♥️🙏🏼","positive"
"285","Singapore airlines, Worst airline ever Had the most horrific dealings with Singapore airlines check in manager at Changi airport, firstly my wife is registered as disabled and my wife and i are both in our 60's. We booked extra legroom seats because of my wife's disability and returned from Singapore to London Heathrow on flight SQ306 on Monday 29th May 2023, we had a really upsetting and stressful experience after we boarded the flight, this was also witnessed by the cabin crew who have submitted a separate report by leading steward Benjamin Khoo. The problem was caused by the boarding gate manager in Singapore, we boarded at gate 9. The first issue was that the seats we had booked were 31A and 31C in premium economy were emergency exit seats and we were told that we would have to be moved because of my wife's mobility issues, this was fine and we were allocated seats 32H and 32K, we were taken to the gate (my wife in a wheelchair) and boarded with no issues and got settled into our seats for the long 13 hour flight home. Obviously the people who were originally in the seats that we moved to were offered the free upgrade for the extra legroom seats we had originally booked, this is where the problems started. One of the passengers ( a male in his late 20's early 30's )who was moved was not happy with the free upgrade and there was obviously a lot of discussions taking place which we could witness from where we were seated but did not know the content of, eventually the check in manager entered the plane ( the same man who gave us our new seats ) and after a few minutes of talking to the man in his 20's / 30's came over to where we were now settled and said that the man was not happy with his new upgraded seat and wanted his original seat back, he ordered us to move to seats 33F and 33G which were middle aisle seats, i told the manager that my wife needed to get up and move around to stop her seizing up, but he was not interested and said move or he would have us escorted from the plane, he was extremely rude and arrogant and was not interested in my wife's disability and the pain it then caused her to move again, he was more interested in letting a fit and able young man have his original seat back. this exchange was witnessed by multiple passengers and crew, the lady who was moved with this young man was not happy either and would have been happy to stay in her upgraded extra legroom seat, if this is the quality of management that Singapore airlines wish to employ we will never travel with Singapore airlines again, this man has single handily destroyed my faith in Singapore airlines. The stewards on the plane were very sorry for what they had witnessed and truly did all they could to try to make up for what had happened but ultimately this check in manager represents the whole of Singapore airlines and this individual had no concern or care for my wife's disability, my wife was extremely upset and we both felt stressed and anxious by this extremely unpleasant experience and would like to think that some form of action be taken against the manager that caused this issue. I emailed Singapore airlines on our return and received a reply which blamed the crew on the plane, i replied telling them the facts again but received no reply, i have tried contacting Singapore airlines a few times and have given them plenty of time to reply but now is the time to tell the world just how Singapore airlines deal with disabled passengers. Finally, i was promised a refund for the upgraded seats we had paid for but have still not received anything, my next email will be to the AviationADR as Singapore airlines clearly do not care about disabled passengers","negative"
"8839","Singapore airline- Italy Discovery Tour We went to Italy on a small group tour with airfare included. The fact that my husband was recovering from a knee replacement prompted us to upgrade to Permium Economy. Checking in was a breeze and we boarded just after Business Class. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Shown to our seat quickly water bottles waiting. More legroom definitely and wider seats. Bigger tv screens and better recliner seats. Just slightly more than standard economy’s. The service was great and the food was good. Disembarking was easy and quick. Our bags were amongst the first out! Overall a very enjoyable flight. Thanks Singapore Airline","positive"

"10177","Having flown with a few middle east carriers throughout this route, definitely I was putting a high expectations from this SQ flight. Got the best price compare with another middle eastern carriers with extra 300 AED for extra 5kgs checked in luggage. The check in process was smooth and I was lucky enough to get upgraded to premium eco seat from SIN to CGK. The DXB to SIN flight was really bumpy, but the crew was really courteous and helpful throughout the flight. The food was definitely better than the middle eastern carriers and also free wifi was a nice touch comparing to any other airlines. The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers). Good job SQ.","positive"

"10961","From boarding in Dusseldorf to reaching Changi, everything went smooth. We were greeted by professional well-presented crew. Upon reach my seat in Premium Economy I wanted to take photo of my seat, where a cabin crew delightfully approached if she can take a picture for me while sitting and said ""it is great to have you on-board Sir and I would like to assure that your special meal is loaded"". We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product. The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean. The air ventilation can be really felt and cabin design made me feel relaxed. The Captain announced turbulence, and crew walked through the cabin to ensure we have fastened seatbelts. Before landing, breakfast was served and immigration cards handed out. We landed in time and I left the aircraft as a happy passenger with a feeling that this was my best flight ever.","positive"

"485","Last flight home of the holidays. Excellent service. This was our last leg of our flights home to Brisbane. We had a 12hr layover in Singapore Changai due to the connecting flight out JFK NY being 3hrs late and Singapore airlines rebooking us due to this. They emailed us the morning before the flight to let us know. Noy good having a 12hr layover but they did there best to get us a connecting flight which is good. The flight left a few minutes late as they didn't open the lounge / gate until 40mins before the flight and everyone had to be screened to get through to the gate. We got off about ten minutes late but this was made up in the flight so we landed on time. We were allocated seats 58A&B and were one of the last groups to board. It was a full flight but we still had some space for our bags above us in the overhead luggage bins. We had someone next to us so we couldn't spread out. The crew were excellent and served the meal after taking off. After the meal, the lights were dimmed and I then accessed the excellent inflight entertainment system and watched some movies on it. The staff were on the ball and were constantly bring water and juice around for the whole flight. The only downside to the flight were some inconsiderate people sitting in front of us and putting seats back when you were trying to eat. The crew were excellent and pulled them up on this. Some people just need to be more aware of what they are doing and respect other passengers. Overall, the flight was good with little turbulence only. I love flying Singapore airlines as the planes are clean and well serviced, the crew is fantastic, always polite and courteous and ensure the comfort of there guests. this was highlighted by the flight stewardesses cuddling a baby when the mum was trying to get ready to get off the plane. The genuine care you could see from the staff was excellent. I cant recommend Singapore Airlines enough.","positive"

"4358","Double payment for flight I recently purchased flights from Melbourne to Koh Samui return. Singapore Airlines has taken the payment from my account twice. They tell me that they are holding it for pre-authorisation. So they take the flight money out on 12th July, then take the same amount again on 17th for pre-authorisation? This is ridiculous. Has anyone else ever experienced this before? By going overdrawn on that account, it has given me no end of problems, least of which was being left stranded at a petrol station with no way of paying for the fuel. Singapore Airlines response and concern has been almost non-existent. I've probably been using SA for 50% of my business flights recently. If there isn't a satisfactory outcome to this, I will insist that Singapore Airlines never be used again.","negative"
"3255","Singapore sets the standard There is a reason Singapore Air is rated year after year one of the top international carriers. I’ve been flying Singapore for decades and have always been impressed with the level of service. I no longer fly enough to secure business class so this time I elected to travel Premium Economy. I would say that Singapore’s economy is better than any US carrier flying to Asia but due to the length of the flight decided to go Premium Economy. The Premium Economy is not business class but is sufficiently better than economy that if you can get a reasonable price for the seat, it is worth the upgrade. You receive some of the same amenities as business class-convenience package, up graded entertainment center including full head phones and the ability to select your meals in advance. The big difference is the seat. The seat is reclinable and there is a leg support and a foot rest. The seat is also wider. I was able to get a reasonably comfortable sleep in the flight. What sets this airline apart is that the planes and cabins are immaculate and the cabin crew are extremely pleasant and attentive to any needs you may have. I’ve flown on three classes of service on Singapore and they have never disappointed.","positive"

"10368","The check-in process at JFK was the worst check-in experience I've experienced. I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didn't move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers. I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didn't even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor.","negative"
"6133","Gone downhill Have flown with Singapore quite a few times over the last 15 years. They were always my number one choice when flying and had always had a good experience with them. But a recent flight from Melbourne to Singapore and back has left me very disappointed. While the food (in economy) was fairly good and service and staff are still great, the seating was beyond uncomfortable. I am 6 foot tall and have always found in the past that their planes have good leg room. Not any more. Both flights were horrendous. My knees touched the seat in front of me, l couldn't stretch my legs at all, both flights were very cramped. Don't think l will be flying with them again, way too uncomfortable for a long flight","neutral"
"5408","World class service I would like to compliment the crews on the flight SQ 387 from Barcelona to Singapore. It was such an exceptional experience as compared to any other airlines that I had been on. I was welcomed into the aircraft by a steward named Reuben, whom had shown a welcoming smile and pointed me in the direction to my seat. I had sprained my right ankle as I was travelling through Barcelona the day before, up till the flight, I was still walking with a slight limp. I guessed that the slight limp had caught the keen attention of the crews as I was walking to my seat. They had checked for my well-being with empathy and politeness, offered me a change of seats to ensure better convenience which I had declined. Shortly after the first meal service, the crew had made an ice pack for my ankle and it came along with a small towel. It was a great relief as the walking that happened before the flight had caused my ankle to swell even more. The ice pack was changed for a total of 5 times throughout the flight by different cabin crews. They had been so consistent with their sincere and genuine service by doing so. They had also informed me that should I require any assistance for the movement around the aircraft, I could always press the “call” button to alert them, and they would ask the steward to assist me as soon as possible. Even though I had not asked for this assistance during the flight, it was such a warm gesture and an extra mile in service. I was not sure if all the crews in Singapore Airlines had this level of service, but the crews on this flight had definitely set the bar for me. I would like to specially commend these crews Eileen, Pek Yun, Rong Yan, Ee Hua, Charles, Pantha and Sanjani. They had shown me their utmost care and concern in absolute kindness and professionalism throughout the 13 hours of the flight. They had managed to make this flight as enjoyable and comfortable for me to the best of their efforts. The flight had departed smoothly and arrived on time with a great landing, thanks to Captains Morgan and John, and Senior First Officer Jeremy in the flight deck. I would like to thank the airline, the in-flight manager and the crews for making this wonderful experience possible. I would definitely share this experience with others and would surely travel with Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"10260","SQ 212 on B777-300 SYD/SIN ; A350-9 SIN/BKK/SIN & SQ 231 on A380 SIN/SYD. First international flight since covid. Two things stand out - as expected, Singapore Airlines were up to their usual high standards with requests, check-in, seating and efficient, friendly cabin service. Despite aircraft being full, a polite request for preferred seating afforded us seats near bulkheads or in exit rows - making the longer sectors far more pleasant with the extra legroom. Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was ""oversize"" and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !. Excellent communication and service. It was apparent the item had missed the connecting flight in Singapore - as evidenced by the ""rush"" stickers etc all over the article.. Singapore Airlines - a cut above the others.","positive"

What a relief!checking in is a breeze and almost a pleasure. All the staff whether ground or cabin are courteous and knowledgeable. But get this - we had a late departure from Hong Kong due to weather which gave us less than 20 minutes to make the connection in Singapore which was achieved by us running flat out through the terminal. We made it just as the gate was closing and as we sat on the plane we decided our luggage would arrive some time next week as there was no way they could have loaded it from one aircraft to the other in such a short time. On arriving in Melbourne there was our luggage on the carousel ready for collection - effortless efficiency in every way. Thank you and well done.","positive"

"4012","Bit disappointed Having flown with Emirates last year and being told Singapore Airlines was even better we were very excited about our flight. Our experience did not match expectation. Firstly, the seats were not as comfortable as Emirates. Secondly, the plane was a bit grubby. The toilets from the beginning heavily smelt or urine, which wasn't nice. Staff were fairly welcoming, but not massively. We both ordered a non fish meal. Our flight from Heathrow to Singapore meal was OK, but because special meals are served first it means you have to wait a long while for your drink. Our meal for our flight from Singapore to Bali was not good. The roll was not edible, and the rest of the meal was not very nice. We felt penalised for ordering a special meal, as other passengers received a Magnum, when we asked we were told we didn't have one as had a special meal. In fairness the air stewardess did give us a Magnum, although slightly begrudgingly! I have raised a complaint with SA, to which they have replied and are investigating. We're hoping our flight home is better. I wonder whether glowing reviews are from those that travel Business or First. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the most awful experince, but it didn't meet expectation, and certainly didn't take the position of favourite airline in my opinion.","neutral"

"555","Premium economy gone downhill Flew from Manchester to Singapore recently on an A350 in Premium Economy and we both agree that this service has gone rapidly downhill since our last flight with then in PE. There does not seem to much legroom and the seats are uncomfortable especially on a 13 hour flight. Food was not good either, very poor selection and the 'book the cook' service is not available on this sector which was disappointing. Did go their offices in Singapore to see how much it would cost one way from Singapore to Manchester. 12,000 sgd!!! Roughly £8,000!!! We declined that. We have always used Singapore Airlines each time we have gone to Singapore and West Australia and been a krisflyer member for 25 years, they were not bothered, all they want to do is make as much money as they can. Will use another airline on the future possibly Qatar as a relative using them and say they are very good and accommodating.","neutral"
"8827","The most backward airline I’ve ever experienced My access online to select my dietary preferences were blocked so I tried calling their offices. The number was so difficult to find, as you know they avoid you calling their call centre like the plague. I eventually found an old number which directed me to an insurance company and it seems to happen a lot, as the response I got from the attendant over the phone that the correct number was instead 13 10 11. They have a long queue of pressing at least 3 options to speak with someone and I got a representative who advised me that they only had gluten free or lactose free options, just not together and not “dairy free”. What day and age do you have to be in to not know that dairy and gluten are well known allergens. I was told to medical certificate and I did for extra charge from my specialist doctor to au_reservations@singaporeairlines.com.sg 6 days before my flight back from Singapore. I received an email receipt for my dietary request and another email asking for my booking number. So much bloody effort. I made a direct complaint and their customer affairs officer explained, “any meal needing to be both Low Lactose and Gluten-Free would need to be custom prepared and uplifted by our Catering Department. As we are only able to accede to custom meal requests on medical grounds, rather than passenger taste preferences, our Catering Managers require a medical document outlining the relevant allergies or intolerances in order to accede to requests of this nature.” I got on my flight yesterday and I was so stressed that I burst into bouts of tears when they started serving food and I hadn’t got my meal request I submitted 6 days prior, even after going through the effort to speak to SG call centre and having to provide a medical certificate. What was the run around for? S*ts and giggles? There was a lovely staff member Sidney? that tried to get to the bottom of my distressed sobs of, “I have a medical condition... I submitted a medical certificate” and she tried her best to cater for me on the flight however I was so exhausted by that stage I didn’t give a rats bottom. I consumed about 10 glasses of water in a span of 15mins and had a nap instantly after my meal. She also submitted a report on my behalf to customer relations. What help is that, I realise because the previous passage was their “politically safe” response. I also made a complete fool of myself in front of my surrounding passengers crying out my frustration. Why ask for a medical certificate if you can’t provide? And stating under all your emails that we can guarantee your dietary request is unacceptable for someone with a legitimate medical condition. There is scientific evidence that dairy and gluten are well known allergens, it’s required by law to state them in food and packaging. I have been discriminated against for having a medical condition. Do you also ask people of Muslim, Jewish, Hindu faith to provide religious certificates to show that their meal requests are not one’s “taste preferences”? What caveman mentality is that? I’ve flown with qantas and they managed to provide my meal with less than 24hrs notice because this is a common combination of intolerance, especially as the medical field is advancing. It’s also none of your business what medical condition I have but I still provided because this is ridiculous. Get your act together SG. You’ve just lost a well-travelled customer who have a lot of word power in the community. I hope justice is delivered to your whole company for this distressing experience. I have been traumatised and I almost didn’t say anything because I felt so down trodden but I will fight back the way I know how.","negative"

"8949","The most uncomfortable business class seat The service on board Singapore Airlines is excellent and the catering is of a high standard. Unfortunately, the business class seat was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever flown in. To put the seat into the flat bed position it is necessary to summon the cabin crew for their assistance. The same thing applies when trying to put the seat into the recline position. The surface of the bed is like sleeping on a board, we were not provided with mattresses,One has to sleep almost diagonally to stretch out your legs, as the place provided for your feet is a small space situated to one side, not directly in front of you! It was a very uncomfortable space to try to sleep in.","positive"
"10944","Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats.","positive"

"10014","Dropping off baggage at Pudong station there were counters open, long line, lots of sighing, but at least the ground staff were polite. The red-eye back was on a 787-10, another first for me, and I liked the layout. Proper seat pockets instead of flimsy nets, USB and power at each seat, pillows and blankets already waiting, and an IFE system that actually responded when you tapped it. I barely used it though, since I was more focused on sleep. Dinner was twice-cooked pork, a little bland but improved with a glass of white wine. Toilets were conveniently mid-cabin, which helped since I was half-asleep most of the flight. The crew handled everything gracefully, including a fellow passenger who ordered a bland meal then complained it was not vegetarian, and spent the rest of the flight blinding people with their flashlight. Not the crew’s fault, but I had secondhand embarrassment on their behalf. Arrival in Singapore was smooth, and I even had time for shopping and a quick stop before security. For a red-eye, this one was not bad at all, flashlight warriors aside.","positive"

We had a few check in counters dedicated to business class passengers, boarding was priority for us, seats were extremely comfortable with ample legroom, lots of in-flight entertainment, crews were friendly and helpful, the food (there were a few courses including dessert!) was nicely plated and to-die-for (we can choose our meals online prior to the flight), toilet was well stocked with mouthwash, toothrushes, body mist etc and everything was EXCELLENT.

"9056","Efficient and comfortable I flew in premium economy for this journey thanks to the bid system available on Singapore Airlines. The system is effective, however for the bids I made it would have made more sense just to book a premium economy seat to begin with as the cost ended up the same. The seat was comfortable and as it was in the exit row had more than enough leg room in front. The missing window however was a bit of a shame. I pre-ordered my meal with the 'book a cook' feature and whilst it was nice not to have to make the decision in the air and have the meal just brought to me when it was ready, the meal didn't quite live up to expectations from the description. The in-flight entertainment system has hundreds of things available to watch making for an easy way to pass time. The screens are responsive and aside from a few pauses in shows, had no issues. There were plenty of times available to order drinks, and the attendants were regularly coming through the cabin. The flight arrived almost an hour ahead of schedule, and luggage was on the carousel almost immediately.","positive"
"8455","Still not up to the expectations Well, this was my second trip to Singapore on this flight within three weeks and I was hoping my experience would get better. Unfortunately, it is not the case.... Check-in was smooth, but it is still frustrating to have to take the train and wait like anybody else while Swiss passengers are taken by limousine....Equally frustrating is having no access to the first class lounge (only to the senator lounge which by the way is quite nice). On board, I already some comments about the cabin. Yes, it is very spacious, and the TV set is beautiful. But there are two things really annoying: the seat that you can only turn electronically, and the bed that is adjacent to your neighbour's, only separated by a wall....meaning that he (or she) is probably sleeping a few centimeters away from you. And everytime the person turns around and hits the wall, you will get waken up. The other problem, which frankly I find incredible at this level of (claimed) service is that they did not have the L-size for the pyjamas....how is this possible?. As the food, the menu looked good, and the ""Georges Blanc"" menu very appealing. The starter was great (Lobsters), but the main course was unfortunately not eatable. The meat was so hard... The movie choice was quite good. In addition, the staff was nice but quite unexperienced. I had to ask to be offered wine. On this route my choice will remain ""Swiss"" rather than Singapore....","neutral"
"5333","Singapore Airlines A380---better that A350..but still inferior In my previous review of the A350 flight to Christchurch, I pointed out that their business class seats were most uncomfortable for stretching out or sleeping, as one could not stretch out straight or lie straight; \but at an acute angle. I expected more from the A380 and was disappointed ; once again you could only stretch at an angle. The angle was less steep in this aircraft and there was better support. The seat belt arrangement too, was better and not uncomfortable. But when Qatar, Emirates, Etihad etc can give you seats that stretch out straight and are super comfortable when fully flat, I wonder why SQ chose such an awkward seat design. The SQ service was , of course, top notch,though one thing stumped me. I ordered a cappucino after lunch; the stewardess brought it and left it on my table without any sugar or a stirrer. I assumed sugar was already added; and tasted it...no sugar. So I had to buzz for sugar and a stirrer. Intrigued, and wondering whether it was just an oversight by my stewardess, I asked my wife to order one. Can you believe it, the same thing happened!","neutral"
"1008","Felt cheated and disappointed, have no way to response to SQ due to the way they had design the customer serbice system. Received an email from Singapore Airlines on an upgrade which cost EUR384/pax/per trip. So I quickly jump in and paid, however when I receipt the email, then did I noticed that it was an upgrade for premium economy only. I felt sad and wanted to request to change back to original seats, however was unable to, and also had a hard time trying to contact customer service team of Singapore Airlines. It was like they design the system in a way which we can't get through to a live agent via FB messaging and SQ apps. very disappointed in the service rendered.","negative"

It was short 45min on time flight. I had to change terminal in changi airport via shuttle inside the airport. Then proceed to lounge. There was a private room section in the lounge. Very few people were there and most of them were there for a short time. I had 5 and half hour lay over in the lounge. Wow! What an experience. Best wine and dine experience I’ve had. Then the flight from Singapore to Mumbai was an A380. It was a 5 hour flight. The first class was located on the lower deck of the aircraft. It was the second A380 of the Singapore Airlines. The first class cabin was old style. But the service and food were impeccable.","positive"
"2070","3 hours of luxury My gf and I decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a business class flight from Singapore to Manila in January 2020. From the minute we walked into the airplane and graciously guided to our own personal business class booths, we knew this flight was going to be our favorite. We've been on over a hundred airplanes before with numerous airlines around the world, but never in a business class seat with Singapore Airlines. The courteousy, respect and professionalism the staff showed us was above and beyond anything I've experienced. We were constantly being checked on, our meals were incredible, we had bottomless drinks of our choice, cozy personal reclining seat /bed to relax in, the latest in entertainment on my own wide screen TV monitor and the bathroom was literally 4 feet away! If you ever feeling like treating yourself or family and /or friends to luxury in the air, do it with Singapore's business class! It's totally worth it!","positive"

I know the airline was in the process of upgrade / refurbishing their planes so i hope they have done this.

A bland piece of white fish, totally lacking in curry sauce & poorly cooked rice (how can they manage that) ??? Was too tired to complain as it was a night flight.

"5143","How did they get Best Airline?? We flew Singapore Airlines flight SQ236 Brisbane to Singapore return, in business class. Honestly we have had better service on Jetstar economy. The Singapore lounge in Brisbane was nice , small but modern and clean with great staff and that’s about the only good thing I could say regarding staff, once we hit the air it was downhill . The A350 is a nice plane, seats are wide and comfortable , but for $6000 a return ticket you would expect some service. We booked the cook pre flights , the meal was served mine and my husbands meals 45 mins apart. No drinks were offered during the meal service. I requested water and waited for 25 mins until I had to flag down an attendant and wait again. The return flight service was just as bad , the staff look annoyed to be there. Breakfast was not served flying into Brisbane and it seemed a bother to ask for a coffee. If you could have the plane and swap the staff over with any budget carrier it might be ok. Seriously rude staff, no amenities kits in business , wi fi didn’t work , dirty toilets. Save your money and fly a budget carrier you will get the same service . Singapore is going downhill , charging for a presumed level of service you won’t get .","negative"
"8305","Worst Experience Of Any Airline For The Money Paid We actually flew PE from Brisbane to London and back from Paris with stopovers in Singapore with one Economy leg from Brisbane to Singapore. The Economy was actually good, probably because there was no PE on board! We then looked forward to the PE. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment and most certainly not worth the extra money. The PE sections were extremely small and cramped with a tiny bit of extra legroom. The food was the same as Economy and mostly bloody awful - excuse the language. On one long flight, we hardly ate anything and asked for some cheese and biscuits. This was not possible! The staff were cold, bossy, and unfriendly and made no effort to greet us by name as Qantas and Virgin do. We were reluctantly served fizzy in paper cups a long time after the plane took off - Qantas and Virgin do it before! SA do not know what the word SERVICE means! By far, the worst flight, however, was the one from Singapore last night. The plane was full, including over one hundred school children who all wanted to use the THREE toilets for the hundreds of PE and Economy passengers at the same time! The food was awful.The cheap Spanish wine doesn't help - there is only a choice of red or white! The entertainment is hopeless. There are hardly any Classic movies, let alone new ones! It mostly consisted of children's cartoons. Unfortunately, my husband thinks that we may travel economy on this airline again. However, if it is my choice, it is Goodbye Singapore Airlines!","negative"

Upon boarding, we were informed that there was an aircraft change to a very old A330 plane without lie-flat seats. Seat was very uncomfortable, not worth a business class ticket. Plane was probably a decade old or more. Inflight entertainment is likewise outdated, not even a touchscreen. Lobster thermidor was salty, rice and asparagus were overcooked. Do not book Singapore Airlines business class, not worth it.","negative"

"6652","Good but has serious competition I had been looking forward to SIA's business class for some time and, overall, was not disappointed. Whether it was the high expectation or the lack of delivery but it was not the greatest of experiences. Istanbul - check-in 3 hours before the flight was excellent and we were directed to the Express Path for Customs/Immigration and into the Turkish Airlines Lounge within minutes. Boarding was good - SIA only has the one flight from Istanbul daily so gets punted to a very remote gate for a very long drive to the aircraft - premium cabin passengers do get priority and a separate bus but in adverse weather it would be an ordeal. On-board - greeting and seating was excellent and I had no initial issues with the seat or cabin. Travelling with my wife and she ended up with a Flight Attendant who was not having a good day and who then was quite curt/brusque with passengers - none of the Singapore Girl's charms on display here. Dining - excellent - food and drink was really good and the Book The Cook option was a good one to explore. Seat/Entertainment - very good but longer-term, the seat was uncomfortable. SIA is often lauded for having a very wide seat but it is necessary as, when reclined, your feet are directed into quite a small cubby-hole towards the centre of the aircraft and you have to lie across you seat to get your feet in. If the seat were any narrower I would not think that you would be at all comfortable. The seat back flips forward to expose the mattress/bedding which is very good and overall the seating/sleeping is good but not great. Etihad offer a more comfortable seat and sleeping experience. To sum up - the best thing about SIA's business class was access to their excellent SilverKris Lounge in Changi Airport - so much better that the very tawdry and very ordinary Gold Kris Lounge. Would I fly Business Class with SIA again? probably, but there are so many other (better) options now available for the sort of $$ that SIA expects - think Etihad, Qatar and the like.","positive"
"7560","Newly retrofitted A380 I traveled on SQ856 on the 12 Dec 2018 from Sin to Hkg and had seat 14D.The seating configuration is 1-2-1 and the middle aisles have a partition. i was surprise by the condition of the partition, which had almost ""dislocated"" at the base. i was afraid that it could fall off the paneling groove. i was a little worried and highlighted this to the stewardess. the flight supervisor came and was helpful and offered me a change of seat. How can the world's best airline treat a customer in this manner, offering a seat with damaged furnishing/parts on a flight? On the return flight SQ863 (A350 - new plane) of 16 Dec 2018, seated at 14F, i could not even get connected to the wifi on board. the stewardess tried to assist, resetting several times but to no avail. The flight supervisor did not even bothered coming to explained what the problem was. This is contrary to what they had advertised as having the best on board entertainment. i am really disappointed with the service standard of this airline.","neutral"

Changi airport is an excellent place to spend a few hours especially if you have access to the business lounge. The food and drinks are very good and most welcome. The seating is comfortable and wide giving a lot of wiggle room, your also able to converse with your travelling companion if your in the middle seats.

"10034","In October 2024 I flew with Singapore Airlines return from Sydney to Phnom Phen and the flights between Singapore and Cambodia were on their new 737-MAX 8. It was my first opportunity to experience their regional business class and from row 2 - their much talked about throne seat. Despite the flight time, Male is another destination in their regional network, only this time it was a 787-10 Dreamliner. Given this is a widebody aircraft, the business class seating is 1x2x1 with the single seats on either side staggered – the front row seat is against the aisle followed by a seat against the window. I usually pre-order my meals using their ‘book the cook’ service but forgot on this occasion. That proved to be a big mistake because what arrived was so underwhelming I can’t even remember what it was. But I know I tried it and then handed the tray and everything on it back to a flight attendant and chose to sleep instead. The seat converts into a lay flat bed which was quite comfortable given there’s no bedding provided other than a blanket and pillow. But the footwell is much more accommodating than the 737 throne seat. However, there’s little room between each row, so business class is tightly packed and on a full flight like mine the cabin is no a haven in the sky. Despite that, I managed to get about 2 hours of much needed sleep. Then on arrival, the rather expensive bottle of champagne I purchased on board was seized. I was unaware that you require a license to bring any alcohol into the country; even if it’s just 1 bottle. It would have been nice if the crew said something before, they processed the sale. Did the flight experience live up to my expectations? – I would have to say no. Sure the aircraft was fairly new, but then it’s hard to guess the age of their planes from the inside. I should rate this experience as 5 out of 10 because Singapore Airlines can do much better and usually do. But I’m feeling generous so I’ll give them 6","neutral"

While in SGN SIA cancelled the afternoon fight and fly 3 hours early. So we hadover 5 h to kill in SIN airport.They treated us like Airasia.

"10753","Flying from Yangon to Singapore on mid morning flight, really showed that SilkAir struggles to match the SIA product. To be fair, we were accommodated on an Airbus A330-300, which has seatback IFE, wider seats and a generally more spacious ambience. Nonetheless, the in-flight meal for the 3 hour flight was just much better than the SilkAir product, and the IFE at least made the time pass faster. The A330 has a 2-4-2 configuration, which makes travelling as a couple or single slightly more enjoyable. The cabin crew were very engaged, going the extra mile for multiple drink servings.","positive"
"1246","Disappointed with broken promises I brought a Ticket from fly365 which went under liquidation last year. In contacting Singapore airlines I was told that my flights were paid for and that I could use it by the end of 2021. I called them on a few occasions to check if the flights were still valid and I was told that Singapore airlines has taken over my flights as it was paid for and if I want to change my flight to a country that has opened their boarder l can with a $50 US change fees. I rang them a month ago to confirm by when can I change my flights and I was told by the end of June, than I don’t have to pay extra fees on top of the $50 US. I called on the 2nd June to rebook my flights and I was told that the money was refunded to the company that went under liquidation in august. This came as a shock as for months I was told that my tickets were paid for and that Singapore airlines will hold my tickets. I also received a email from the airline manager ( Dejan Eminagic), who stated that my tickets were confirmed. I was fed with false information by the Singapore airlines staff for more than a year. I’m so disappointed with the lies I was presented to by the Singapore airline team.. a apology does not mean anything when they can’t honor their word.

"10934","Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore with Singapore Airline. It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I would’ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything. I am not upset about my luggage not being able to get on my second flight but I'm deeply disappointed about the service and how the staff handled it. I will never take Singapore Airline or recommend to my family and friends.","negative"
"6930","Disappointed faithful customers Having been more than happy with Singapore in the past we booked again - tickets that were more expensive than anyone else. The price did not justify the service. The seat was so cramped I couldn’t sit with my knees together. The toilet stank before we even took off (men’s urinal). Pre dinner drinks don’t exist anymore (on any of the recent 6 Singapore flights we took this only happened on the last one) and it seems that the serving of alcohol is being scaled right down - a gin and tonic was almost too much trouble and not readily available. The food was generally terrible and again been scaled right back - terrible white rolls, ice ctreams for dessert or nothing, gluggy tough meat courses, no fresh fruit or eggs for breakfast. I used to look forward to having a relaxing drink and a meal on Singapore - not on these flights. The staff were generally snappy and it seems, over all that the focus has gone to more expensive seats. Unfair and disappointing for the majority of us in economy as the seats were still damn expensive.","negative"

On the first page you choose the flight to your destination at the advertised prize then on the second page book your return only to find out that your booking class is no more available and one is forced to pay considerably more. To make matters worse you have to pay extra for a reserved seat, pay some more for a ""forward seat"" and baggage allowance for the return leg might differ too. All very confusing and misleading. Overall the website resembles more and more a ""el cheapo"" budget airline. Service on board has been cut too - no more snacks and refreshments before the main meal, asking for water results in a sip out out of plastic cup - what about a 500ml water bottle available in Thailand for 20 cents. It seems obvious that the bean counters are now in charge at headquarters","negative"

Service was good as usual. Crew seem tired since I didn't see any crew change taking place. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was great. Had a choice between pork with BBQ flavoured rice and chicken with pasta. I had the pork while my companion had the chicken. My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good though portions are minuscule. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens fortunately still AVOD. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard 32 inches. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. The flight was full. I tried asking for souvenirs and was given postcards and playing cards with a smile this time. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.","positive"
"6696","Remains My Favourite On my annual vacation in December 2018, I chose to fly Singapore Airlines once again after an hiatus of 1 year, as I decided to fly with Qatar Airlines the year before. Although I found absolutely nothing wrong with Qatar Air, I just hate the layover time in Doha - far too long as it is close to 4 hours. The beauty of my flight with Singapore Airlines is that it is the quickest our of South Africa to Changi with a mere hour and thirty minutes layover. I´m amazed time and time again at their impeccable service and more so their willingness to go the extra mile. No request is ever too much as they aim to please and to exceed expectations. Both my outward and inward flight were perfect. I have already secured my flight for December 2019 with no other than Singapore Airlines!","positive"

My tray table was filthy, there was still rubbish from the previous flight in the front pocket, the toilets were filthy from the start of the flight and the plane was very old and shabby - not a good look Singapore Air!!","neutral"
"4807","Not to usual SIA standards Not a full flight but the staff were not as attentive as you would expect, maybe as it was a night flight. For the first time the food was inedible, very poor quality. I know this must have been a one off as I have flown SIA many times and they were faultless.","positive"
"5450","Class difference glaring I came from Delhi to Sydney in April and shall be flying back to New Delhi on 22 nd of this month. I feel that the airlines makes you realise time and again that in economy class you are last preferred traveller. I agree that the higher class passengers should be given more facilities and upgraded food but this should not be apparent to all in welcoming, announcement, And basic courtseys at check-in. The staff was efficient in the flight and tried their best to make everything perfect. On the upcoming flight on 22nd I am not entusiastic rather am scared of the cramped seats and plastic glasses even for beer or drinks. They should at least have the courtesy of giving cans along with a disposable glass. In India whole Shatabdi or Rajdhani trains serve better food in better cutlery to a crowd 20 times that is in the airplane. I think Singapore airlines and others should learn from them. Waiting for the horrific experience to begin on 22nd...","positive"
"3346","NOT NO 1 People rave about this airline. The only times I and my family have used it, we have had terrible service, both on the ground and in the air. To the point we would not recommend it and go out of our way to use another carrier. Very disapointed customer.","negative"
"4671","Checking in Brisbane Very unhelpful desk staff changed our selection of seats made to feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed Told flight was full but there were at least 8 rows with 1 person in each row we were assigned seats where a stranger was put in middle of us Very difficult to get answers from Singapore Airlines and still waiting for $150 vouchers for 2 people which were offered over 7 months ago It is the ground crew that are outsourced for check in that are the problem no matter how nice you are to them Upon reaching Singapore the staff there were more than accommodating to re seat us","negative"

"8061","Upgrade to Premium Economy My wife and I fly regularly to Australia, we thought we would try Singapore Airways on this trip. Purchased an upgrade to Premium Economy at a cost of £210 each. What a complete waste and money! On the plus side was the larger seats, more leg room and good attendants. On the negative side, was the food , although pre ordered on line, was dreadful, with the beef bourginon awful, choice or one red wine and one white wine, both cheap and undrinkable! Then an hour into our flight, obese economy passengers, who were too fat for the economy seats, were upgraded to Premium Economy free of charge! Don’t waste your money upgrading, or if your obese ask for it free!","negative"
"8145","Classy Airline Booked a trip to Australia via an online travel agent and was pleased to find that the airline was Singapore after reading reviews and we werent disappointed. There were 4 of us travelling and I had booked extra legroom seats for 2 of our party as the were 6ft and 6ft 4. We are also tall but were quite comfortable in our regular seats. From the moments we got on board the lovely hostesses in their beautiful ""uniforms"" made us feel welcome. Nothing was too much trouble and they came around with water and snacks all through the night without disturbing anyone. Meals were served with menus and proper cutlery although the food was average. All there flights boarded (3) on time without delay","positive"

Everything from check-in, boarding, cabin service, baggage handling, meals, seats went smoothly on this return flight which we had to book at extremely short notice for a family emergency (booked the flight less than 12 hours hours before departure). The call centre and airport staff did everything they could to sort out our vegetarian meals, and provide a wheelchair for my elderly aunt that travelled with me. Singapore Airlines is generally one of the cheaper options on this route which we travel on quite frequently but I would spend that extra money even if it’s not the cheapest option. No WiFi on any flights.","positive"

It used to be slightly more expensive, but now we find it is on a par with most other airlines for pricing. Our checkin this time was very efficient, the staff were friendly, and luggage was checked through to our destination of Phnom Penh. On board the staff were friendly and helpful as always. Food is reasonable. Toilets are kept reasonably clean considering the number of people using them. In flight entertainment was great, saw a couple of new releases. Music selection suited me as well.

Both flights themselves were also excellent with the very high quality of food, drink & service I have come to expect from Singapore Airlines.","positive"

"3373","Singapore Airlines SQ361/SQ362 - ARN/SIN SIN/ARN Transit via Moscow DME [Update] [This is an update to my earlier post regarding Singapore Airlines SQ361/SQ362 - ARN/SIN SIN/ARN Transit via Moscow DME] When I posted that earlier review I didn't mention that I was travelling business class on SQ361/2, and that I was unable to find a convenient business class lounge for the DME layover. Now that I have travelled this route again here's what I can share with you if you too are travelling business class on SQ361/362 via DME. There is a lounge that business class travellers can use. Its called бизнес зал аэропорта (Airport Business Lounge). Its location and directions to it are actually printed on the reverse of the transit boarding card that you receive at DME. (I only realised that the directions to the lounge were printed on the back of the transit boarding card after my trip was over - easy to miss, and nothing to indicate business class lounge availability after passing through transit security) As you exit from the Transit security area immediately turn left and ascend the escalator (instead of walking along the corridor straight ahead to gate at which you will re-board SQ361/2) to the level above and follow the signs to a corridor on your right that indicates the location of the Airport Business Lounge (there are a couple of other lounges along that corridor). The lounge offers food and drinks and a place to relax. It's about 5 minutes walk back to the departure gate.","positive"

Not allowed to change....This time, we are given emergency exit seats, so not sure if these seats are reserved for points passengers? Need to understand if these are SIA’s policy on points claim.","neutral"

Drinks and meals obviously provided. Loved the wine :) Service is great always smiling and the A380 is a smooth ride. Will definitely fly Singapore again.","positive"

The B787 on business class was small seats and was very cramped but he food was 5 stars The Singapore to Brisbane had bad food as usual and the crew were the laziest I have ever experienced. A passenger heard them say get the meal done with and turn off the lights.There was not a drink given after takeoff as usual on all Singapore Airlines flights. Ther was no water bottles given to passengers after the first meal. The second meal wa very rushed","positive"
"1692","A perfect start to a long distance holiday This was the first leg of our holiday in New Zealand, a stop off in Singapore. Although we hadn't flown with Singapore Airlines before, they came well recommended. The reviewers didn't lie! This was one of the best long distance flights we've had. The aircraft (Boeing 777-300) was reasonably spacious, the food very good and the cabin crew excellent. An overnight flight of 12 hours + was never going to be a sinecure. However, the staff made the whole trip very enjoyable. The in-flight entertainment was very good, with new-rease movies, and satellite box-sets available. We arrived safe and well in Singapore, ready to enjoy what this amazing city has to offer. Thank you to the crew aboard SQ321!","positive"
"8072","Great flight and great crew We flew on one of their 777-300er's. It was my first time on that particular type of plane as I usually fly to Asia on the Airbus a380. The plane was well laid out and the seats were comfortable. Boarding was quick and easy for a plane this size. The food was pretty good and plentiful. The crew however was amazing. I somehow injured my arm during the flight and was in extreme pain. The crew made hot and cold packs for me and wrapped my arm for compression. There was an empty row that they allowed me to lay down in to make me more comfortable. The really went above and beyond for me.","positive"
"2250","Consistently good Have had the opportunity to fly with Singapore airlines a few times. Always been a pleasure. I order gluten free meals (I have Celiacs), they always have my meals on hand and they even try to find me something when ice creams are handed out on flights.","positive"

"10280","They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this.","negative"
"579","Worst travel experiences for family with toddle. My 2 years old baby was too tired after nearly haft day discover the terminal so he slept right after enter the airplane. But then he was asked to sit up for landing off. Though I tried to explain that he has just slept and we already set the belt on him or I hold him with me but all the crew don’t care about that and still ask me to keep him sit up. My boy then cry out lound for nearly 15mins while the plane go around before landing off but the crew still don’t care at all. Later, he awake and can’t sleep again. Don’t understand why a 5 stars airlines have that stricky way to deal with baby. This might be the first and also the last time me and my family flight with Singapore airlines.","negative"

"4476","Loved the customer service! This is the first time on Singapore Airlines, the airplane we were on was apparently one of their newer ones. We booked Premium Economy, which allows you to choose your meals. They have tons of options and several for those with dietary restrictions. In between each meal you also get ""snacks"" which includes anywhere from chips to sandwiches! I had the bland meal and boy was it BLAND! I have a lot of stomach sensitivities so this worked for me, however many of the items I couldn't eat because I am also lactose. However, the portions you get are quite decent. As someone mentioned as soon as you get seated you are given a hot towel to wipe your hands on. Each seat has a footrest (thank goodness), however when you use the footrest it doesn't leave you much space underneath the seat in front of you. The seating was two, four and two, then there are actually (at least what I saw) three seats in the back left that are individual seats which look pretty large. The flight looked to only have Business class and Premium Economy. There were tons of movies, shows and music on the flight to keep you busy. Each seat comes with a pillow, blanket and a set of ear phones. There is even a USB port hook up. For the night flight they even give each passenger a small toiletry bag that has socks, ear plugs, sleeping mask, and toothbrush/toothpaste. There are three bathrooms for the back of the plan and then two I believe for those in Business class, however I saw multiple people from my side and sneak in and use those bathrooms! I would say the only “complaint” I would have was trying to get out of the airplane, the Business class were sooooo slow and it took forever! Upside, when you board they have at least two different lines that allow people to go in. However, right as you line up to board they didn’t really call anyone in any specific order, it was more confusing coming back. Overall, we had a good flight, it was quick, staff is efficient, the plane was clean and the staff was extremely courteous!","positive"
"689","Not good as Singapore Airline earned rating Took off from Changi AP at 00:45 13/11/2022 Singapore Air used to be an excellent Airline in the past, not anymore and its service goest down to the tube. Its airfares are not so competitive with other, similar to its cousin SCOOT. Not a welcome drink ( orange juice or water), put guests to sleep straight away and no sign of crew around. Only one meal served during 8 hours flight, 2 hours before landing at Sydney AP, no snack, no refreshment. Crew served meal, rushed out to traveller and did not offer refilling tea or coffee as usual, rudely and walked away with few requests from other travellers. Perhaps guests on board are beggars.","negative"

"5246","Excellent Service, but issues with new Entertainment System & new seats My feedback was based on both the above-mentioned flight, and the previous flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich. I flew on SQ328 on 19 May 19 and SQ317 on 3 Jun 19. 1. Professional Cabin Crew and Excellent Service. I would like to commend the cabin crew on both flights, although I was unable to recall any particular names. Especially on SQ317 from LHR to SIN, the cabin crew serving us during the flight when the lights were dimmed have provided excellent service. My wife and I were very grateful that the crew have been very attentive and expedient to our needs, including requests to fill up our water bottle and for cup noodles during the wee hours. 2. Audio on Entertainment System I was initially very pleased to get to use the new Krisworld systems installed on both flights (A350 for SQ328 and A380 for SQ317). The touchscreens are definitely a better interface than using manual controllers in older systems. I was also delighted that I could enter my Krisflyer number or email address to create a personal profile. However, the quality of the audio in the new Krisworld system in Economy class left much to be desired. On SQ328 when I first encountered the issue with the audio, I had thought it was only a one-off perhaps due to faulty earphones. However, my concerns were verified on SQ317 when I experienced the same problem with the audio even though I was on a different aircraft and using a different set of earphones. The bass volume in the audio feed was too loud relative to the treble volume. This was especially apparent when listening to music in flight, as it resulted in muffled, unclear, and even flat tones when playing lower pitch sounds. The higher pitch sounds were okay. What made it worse was that the bass and treble volumes could not be adjusted in the settings. There was only one volume bar to adjust. 3. Lack of Footrest I was rather taken aback that the new economy class seats on the A350 and A380 aircraft now had no footrest.","positive"
"4544","Great service Though the flight lasted only a few hours; Singapore Airlines lived up to its reputation. Flight attendants were very attentive and almost always referred to passengers by their names. Food and beverage were excellent. Choice of meal requested was provided. The plane was very clean. Flight was on time. Business class seats were very comfortable. Having flown business class on many airlines; one notices that staff is more attentive to passengers but what I appreciated the most and found most unique was the array of choice in terms of music and movies in their entertainment system - truly amazing - have never experienced such a vast selection. I would fly with them again just for that reason","positive"

"9755","Bit of a disappointment Checked in at Akl airport to start our honeymoon and requested leg room due to my wife’s knee surgery. Was told that the plane was full and we were not even able to get an empty seat next to us which is understandable. However upon take off we noticed an entire row of 3 empty seats right next to us :/. As our seats were right by the toilets at the end of the plane, sleeping on a 10 hr flight was not quite an option. We were checked in all the way to our final destination in Scandinavia when we started the trip but once boarding the second long leg of our trip in Singapore we were not even seated together. That was very disappointing as we told the lady at the check in that we were heading out on our honeymoon and assumed that even if we were given the worst seats on the plane we would at least be seated together since my wife is also a bit of an anxious flyer. So the the next 12 hrs was spent me trying to hold her hand from behind her seat during take off, the turbulent flight and landing. The Actual service on the plane was great. The food was good and the attendants very accommodating. So I guess it was not a total disaster but still not a great start to a trip that is really a once in a lifetime experience.","neutral"

Will definitely recommend travelling by Singapore Airlines. Additionally, they had an offer running and we received 20 SGD vouchers to shop at Changi Airport, it was a cherry on the cake.","positive"
"8218","Use of tired old plans to Perth We were returning from Zurich and took the connecting flight from Singapore to Perth. We were supposed to travel on a 777 but instead they used an old Airbus which was very tired, and had grubby and frayed seats. SIA need to lift their game if they are concerned about their image and either clean up their old Airbuses, or decommission them! It’s not as if we were given a cheap fare deal as we paid a high price for 2 return tickets from Perth to Europe. The customer service onboard is always good but the crew on the day took a very long time to get organised before we eventually got our meals, due to a mixup over the special meals they had to serve first to other passengers. What a shambles!! The meals were not their usual standard on this flight. I am now considering other airlines for our next overseas flight.","neutral"
"4376","Good but not Wow, Not no Impressive Catering in/out from Sydney Originally booked on Premium Economy but scored a last minute paid upgrade upon check-in to business class. I was even willing to pay a bit more to score a new suite upgrade, but sadly is full. Beginning at the lounge, perhaps is breakfast and also since it is not a lounge in Asia, hence, the food look and tasted very average or less than average. Fine with the usual western fare but items were mostly lukewarm or doesn't taste very fresh. Asian choice Nasi Lemak also look very sad with limited condiments. Plus point of the lounge is quite spacious and lots of daylight coming in. Perhaps lunch, afternoon and dinner food might be better. Boarding was speedy being is business class despite the entire upper deck of passengers in suites and business. Seated in 97A the last seat in business class was fine. This is my third time being on the new A380 business class. Food wise, have to say catering from Sydney seems not as impressive as from other routes. For many medium, long haul flights it seems satay is the starter but I never get it (haha). Instead gotten a typical Caesar salad but have to say the lettuce was very fresh. Because I was originally in Premium economy, and hence, had already book the cook: Seafood thermidor (the little unwanted brother of lobster thermidor), and have to say this will be the last time I will order this. As they already uploaded my PE BTC meal, and, also I did not want to waste food, nor did find anything particularly exciting from the menu, hence, I stick to my BTC. Just a little note that I find strange that the crew did not ask me if I wanted something from the main menu instead. Now I look back, should have taken the main menu mains. Service wise, was good but not wow. At the beginning, the lady crew serving me was very proper and kind of not very personal. Another male crew was slightly better with little more energy and personality. Would I paid for business class upgrade again? Definitely yes if the price is not too bad and available at check-in. Else, if advance booking, I doubt I will want to pay full price for it.","positive"

"10773","Melbourne to London return via Singapore, with A-350 on both MEL-SIN legs, A-80 on SIN-LHR and B-777-300ER on LHR-SIN. Early departure from MEL and very efficient service. The A350 business class seat and fit-out is very modern and high quality. The A380 and B777 is a bit older but still good. Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason. Amenities were available in the bathroom, although I didn't realise this until the second leg. Perhaps they should announce it or tell you upon boarding, rather than leaving you to wait for a kit? Overall, very pleasant flights despite the length. On MEL-SIN-LHR, the flight arrived at Terminal 3 and departed Terminal 1, which was a bit disappointing for the national carrier's airport. I had gone to the lounge before realising my connecting flight was in a different terminal.","positive"
"5163","Very Good A very nice, comfortable round-trip flight Bangkok - Singapore - Bangkok. Everything was as one would expect: a newish plane, clean cabin, quick and easy check-in and boarding, good selection of in-flight entertainment, very beautiful cabin crew (i especially liked their uniforms - very pretty and stylish). I would choose Singapore Airlines again. I recommend them.","positive"
"325","Highest standards This review is for a return journey. We flew the Brisbane Singapore route on the A350 900 regional aircraft and the A380 on the Singapore London route. The regional aircraft is very comfortable in both sitting and lying. We were not as comfortable in the A380. Sitting up straight and lying down was okay but lounging was very uncomfortable with a seam in the seat that ground into one's coccyx. We had window seats mostly and they felt very private. The staff were exceptional as always on all flights and the bathrooms were kept clean and tidy. The choice of food was best from Book the Cook and there was an excellent wine choice. Speciality coffees are welcome. We unfortunately heard criticism from other passengers when we were delayed boarding on one flight. I do think we need to be more generous and understand the world is still getting back on its feet since COVID-19. Thank you Singapore Airlines. You made our trip memorable and nothing was too much trouble.","positive"
"11119","Brisbane - Singapore, the flight was smooth, the service was top notch, very professional from entry to exit, nothing was left unturned. It was a red eye flight but the cabin crew were still active throughout the cabin. This is why they're sitting at second place in top 10 airlines in 2015. My only problems were the seat was kind of small for my size but that what you get for flying economy, the in-flight entertainment had a good selection of movies but the screen I felt wasn't clear in this day and age where HD is supreme and lastly the meal was smaller then I remember on my last Singapore Airlines flight 10 years ago. Overall highly recommended airline.","positive"
"1416","Flight to Singapore Very comfortable, lovely cabin staff, personal tv’s with not so up to date movies and tv shows but enough to keep you busy. Food leaves a bit to be desired. We flew both ways and one was a day flight and one was a night flight. Hot towels were very nice.","positive"
"9640","Good in parts We have flown Singapore airlines for many trips now and always been happy with the service. Don't know what happened this time but it wasn't quite up to scratch. On the way to Singapore my husbands connecting flight (Canberra to Sydney) was cancelled on about 9 occasions which was both frustrating and time consuming. We paid additional money to travel premium economy on the way to Singapore - it was very good and worth the money. Staff were friendly and food was good and plentiful and the additional space in the seats made it comfortable. On the return journey from Singapore to Sydney however we were in economy and there was a limited amount of food. The flight left at 7.30am and we did not eat at the airport. Breakfast on the plane was a bread roll and a container of juice. There didn't seem to be enough staff and those that were there seemed tired and over it (they probably were). It just didn't seem to be up to their normal standard.","neutral"
"8863","System fault can’t check in online Due to SA system fault I can’t check in online and therefore have to check in last minute at the airport!! (Can’t check in online means can’t choose seat very annoying) Was given the middle seat which I’m not happy at all as I was travelling alone and always wanted an aisle seat! Despite telling the ground staff at check in counter of my preference they just said ‘sorry we can’t help you should have checked in online) but it’s not my fault that I can’t check in online.. this is not the 1st time... I have since try not to travel with Singapore airline but choose other airline instead because there is no customer service in their vocabulary unfortunately..","negative"
"6181","Pleasant flight Flew with SQ in my most recent flight from SGN to SFO via SIN and HKG. In overall, the experience on Premium Economy Class was absolutely great with nice service, good food, thoughtful crew. The aircraft was Boeing 777-300ER. Departure was on time but arrival to SFO was a bit late as we had to wait on tarmac approx 30 minutes before parking.","positive"
"2121","Family trip December Business class to Incheon. It was a morning flight. First time on the new plane. Find that the seat seems to be smaller compared to the ones I took previously. Still, the length and position of the leg room is not meant for people with slightly long legs and the slanted angle somehow is not good for long hours of rest should you have a long flight. But still cleanliness and service deserved a thumbs up.","positive"
"4824","Wonderful International Experience It was my first flight experience with Singapore airlines on this non stop flight from USA to Japan. I had always used other airlines for my international flights. This was better than I expected. Economy seats are still relatively roomy. Meals and drinks were really good. I'd fly with them again if I can find a good price. Their hub on West coast seems to be at LAX so I would have to connect there to utilize them more. Hope they will expand their stops.","positive"
"11311","Flew MEL to SIN using a 777-200. Ever since SQ removed the A380 from Australian flights their value for money is no longer there. The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight the IFE was not working the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for. Even Vietnam Airlines now will be flying the A350 and the B787-900 to Melbourne soon. I'm really disappointed.","negative"
"1331","Best flight I have taken! We wanted to try the Singapore Airlines flight to NYC so we booked on this flight which seems to have only Premium Economy seatings. The seats were great and legroom adequate. Service by the flight attendants were great as usual. The in-flight entertainment was a great help as other than sleeping, not much you can do on the plane (to anywhere for that matter). Will fly this route and airline again!","positive"
"730","Lost the Plot Now tried for 3 days to log in as Kris Flyer. Changed my password etc multiple times. Still cannot log in and my experience mirrored by countless others it appears. No customer service. My last flight left late which meant my luggage didn't make my connection at Changi so arrived in Hanoi with no hold baggage. Had to return to airport next day to collect. No a word from the airline re apology etc. Will never use Singapore Airlines again. They are apparently in deep economic trouble which is ONLY due to poor customer service/ management and NOT because of Covid, world current economic climate etc.","negative"
"7769","Service and comfort Singapore Airlines always delivers courteous, comfortable amenity. Their meals offer choices for Asian and Western tastes. Staff are always keen to assist customers to have the best flight experience possible. Singapore is a great stop over for Australians on their way to Europe and back, breaking the journey and providing lots of opportunities to shop, to dine, to rest and refresh.","positive"

"2679","Fantastic long haul flight Was dreading a long haul flight but it was really comfortable and easy. The food was surprisingly good and the cabin crew were gracious and unfailingly helpful.

"1096","Singapore airlines Cancelled my flight 2 days before my departure and they charged me a $800 cancellation fee ?!!! Worst customer service ever.

"2992","Good Flight and Excellent Services I took an epic holidays in August and September this year. I flew to Singapore for three nights, then to Kuala Lumpur for 3 nights, then to Bali for eight nights and back to Singapore for another six nights before returning to London. Wow what a trip! It was an amazing and memorable holidays. It was therefore very important to choose the right Airline for this trip. It was pretty easy to book Singapore Airline on line and pay extra to choose my seat in advance before getting to the airport. It was also easy to check in by using the Singapore Airline App. I would recommend downloading the app even for one flight. Dropping luggages at the counter were very easy by using the automated facilities at the Heathrow airport. There were staffs at hand in case of any difficulties with tagging the luggages. The flight was full and left more or less on time. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful during the flight. The food was very good and the services were excellent. I found the seat a bit uncomfortable after such a long journey (12hours). Lack of leg room did not help. Yeah, will fly Singapore airline again.","positive"
"7222","Better than last time Was heading to KL from Colombo, Sri Lanka this time for a holiday with SQ. It was a disappointment when I flew with Singapore airlines last time but have to say that this time it was way better. The flight crew was friendly and helpful. The meals were average and didn't have better options to choose with. Liked the effort that the team have put in to decorate inside the flight for Christmas. Small things makes a huge difference in the industry. Hope it improves up to the glory they had few years back.","positive"
"4119","Poor check-in and boarding logistics and service My trip had the following legs: OSL-CPH-SIN-AKL In OSL there was a long struggle getting around the mandatory visa requirement in the system, which is incorrect, as Norwegians do not require visa to NZ. After some phone calls problem was seemingly resolved, and I was checked-in. In CPH I was called at the gate where a long and tedious processing and questioning ensued as there was an issue with visa - again. They were unwilling to disclose what the problem was, but asked and acted like they tried to solve a new type of problem. After much tos-and-fros I was allowed onboard the SIN flight. In SIN there was not much time between flights, but I made it just in time for boarding only to be denied entry as I did not have a visa. Again - not required. After some discussion the visa track was directed to flight/PNR out of NZ. This flight was never brought up in OSL or in CPH, if it had I would have been able to sort that out well before SIN boarding, and that is also the requirement of Singapore airlines to ensure all requirments of a traveller are met at the beginning of the PNR, meaning that boarding at first flight meets all requirements throught to the end destination. Instead my boarding processes were halted with a system malfuntion requiring a NZ visa. As my NZ flight was booked separately by my travel partner, I had to get that from him. Problem was that he was on a different flight. There was no help from any of the staff in any manner whatsoever, and they did not accept responsibility for this requirement not being communicated to me in OSL or CPH. The only thing that was communicated to me throughout was the errouneous visa requirement. Fortunately my partner had just landed in AKL and thus I got my out-of-NZ PNR and was allowed boarding as one of the last passengers.. He could also inform me that he was not asked for a return ticket out of NZ anywhere on his trip and entered AKL without having showed it to anyone - so this is quite disturbing. No best practices, no adherence to regulations, simply very random. That said the CPH-SIN flight was excellent. Excellent food. Excellent staff. Wide flatbed seat, but it would be nice with a mattress.","positive"
"246","My favorite airline This is our first time to travel for a long flight (14 hours direct) with 1 year old. Flight attendants were helpful and sometimes spoke to my kid when he was a bit cranky. Service was great as usual. I would definitely recommend SQ!","positive"
"10867","Singapore to London. Business class with my family for holiday. Daytime flight thus the service quality becomes very important as there were not much sleeping time. A380 has been in service for a while thus the seats are quite worn and despite the best maintenance it still shows, the buttons are tough to press and the inflight entertainment remote is also quite tough to be responsive; having said this they have promised to revamp the seats soon. The seats are quite wide and when converted to a bed the upper part of the seats are wide and comfortable but the lower part where the feet lays are a bit narrow. Food was fantastic as we applied for book the cook facility. The satay was amazing and the subsequent courses did not fail to please my family. Inflight entertainment was very good but I would have loved a wider collection of not-so-recent movies. The cabin service is fantastic; cabin crew makes an effort to recognize us and even some recognized us on other flights where they were on with us on a later date.","positive"
"491","Really disappointing - go BA Had heard great things but service and quality of seating far inferior to that of BA. Food terrible and don't believe it was any different to economy. Poor and slow service. No flight socks, eyeshades, etc. Would not recommend on the basis of this flight.","negative"
"7478","The Best Airline ! SIA in my opinion is the best in the world. Charming and well groomed cabin crew, always greeting you with a smile. Going the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. The seat is amazing- leather with full flat bed, with soft duvet and fluffy pillows. It makes the BA business class seat look cheap and tacky. The inflight entertainment always offers the latest movies and a large selection of music from different genres. Food is ok - not one of their strengths. The toilets are always spotlessly clean. The crew actually clean them regularly, compared to horrible smelly toilets on other airlines ie BA -yuck ! There is a reason why they are doing well- they really focus on customer care unlike the other airlines.","positive"
"2921","Another amazing trip on our Australian adventure Once again we had amazing service from the airline staff. The food was exceptional, my lobster and lamb meals were restaurant quality and nothing was too much trouble when it came to drink requests, from Singapore Slings to the glass of tawny port with the cheese.","positive"
"5321","Excellent service I would like to give a feedback of my SQ983 flight, 25 May 19, Business Class, BKK-SIN. I flew with my dad and mom. Thought it was a short haul flight, I really enjoyed the facility provided in the lounge and aircraft. I would like to especially thanks the Business Class crews, IFS DOREEN AW IFS SEAN LSS MAIRA FS ZACK PEEH FSS LAI The service they provided was excellent. They really care about the comfort of passengers. Although my mom and my dad cannot speak English, the crews try their best to make this flight as smooth as possible. I really really appreciate the service.","positive"
"8513","NEVER again ! To leave Singapore airlines a remnant of hounour: The employees are GREAT. Always helpful with a smile. The food is quite good too. Washrooms seem to be cleaned every half hour..... all what one expects when flying with an Asian airline... But just today I completed TWO flights with Singapore Airlines... The first: 2 hours from Ho Chin Minh City to Singapore The 2nd: THIRTEEN hours from Singapore to Frankfurt. And BOTH (different planes) had the SAME PROBLEM. It was FREEZING in the economy cabin. That might be fine for a 2 hour flight, but being wrapped in TWO blankets for 13 whole hours and still being COLD is NOT what I would call world-class air travel. The economy cabin looked like an Obi-Wan-Kenobi convention, everyone wearing their winter jackets and all the blankets they could find...... Turn on the heat, PLEASE!","neutral"
"4486","West Jet direct flight available from Calgary to San Diego. it only takes 3 hours and 11 minutes or so. They charged for check in luggage. $30 each bag USD & CAD each way. they provide a drink and snacks. other foods have charges. good flights, but both are delayed.","neutral"

"5860","Rough ride I flew from Singapore to Perth last month after a premium flight from the uk, which was fine but not great. The plane we boarded on the next flight from Singapore to Perth was likened to a cattle truck. Tatty seats uncomfortable , the tv were not working for hardly anyone . Children were standing on seats and parents and children were walking up the isles. Obviously there was no room to nurse a child and I felt sorry for them . Yes I had come off a premium flight of 17 hours but the last five hours of flying on this flight was awful. I won’t fly that route again or with them. The staff were great rushed of their feet.","negative"
"4256","In flight service was great, food was pretty good, leg room a little tight for tall husband. The A380 was quiet but the economy seats left my husband a little cramped. The in flight service was efficient, I am gluten free and dairy free and I was provided with plenty of food. Coming home from Singapore to Sydney we upgraded to premium economy, it was fabulous. Much bigger leather seats, lots of leg room, I could move around easily to ease an injured leg and the seats recline a little further than economy. If you can afford the upgrade, do it.","positive"
"357","Not worth the price Constant disappointment with SQ lately. Food is extremely bad, I fell sick after my last short flight to HK. Customer service and benefits for Krisflyer members are mediocre and the website is constantly failing. Not sure what they do with the money they charge cause their product quality has clearly dropped. Not what it used to be. Flying Japanese/Middle Eastern airlines moving forward.","negative"
"3515","Best Global Airline I have been a loyal SQ customer since I moved to Singapore over 25 years ago. In that time, Singapore Airlines has only gotten better year to year. The crew are the best I've ever flown with, helpful, always smiling, organized and relaxed boarding, fantastic media access, wi-fi. great equipment, clean comfortable cabins/seatts, arrival/departures always timely...I can go on and on! Of course there is a bit of premium over other airlines but then there is no apple for apple comparison.","positive"
"3394","Quickest flight to the UK Flew Wellington, Melbourne, Singapore, Heathrow. It was the fastest we’ve flown, with minimal stopovers (1.5hours) in Melbourne and Singapore. Great way to go if you don’t want to hang around unnecessarily in airports.","positive"
"11159","Singapore to Hong Kong, and on boarding I was greeted with a smile, staff directing me to my seat and offering to place my bag in the overhead compartment. I expressed my fear of flying on the A380 because it was a huge plane. The FA reassured me and was able to comfort me despite the fact that it was a rather a bumpy flight. Often, one of the female Flight attendants would come up to me and asked if I was feeling alright. The food served was greatly prepared and Im satisfied. The seats were comfortable and I enjoyed inflight entertainment.","positive"
"1278","Singapore Airlines got us home We booked flights in August 2020 to travel to Australia in November. These flights were cancelled twice: the first time by a flight number change, and the second time by a process error. Thanks to Randi at Singapore Airlines Copenhagen; she ensured we were put back on our flights and worked hard to guarantee our seats. She then took my multiple calls calmly and empathetically when I was worried about changing arrival caps and our ability to travel. Without Randi in Copenhagen, we would never have made it home. Thank you Randi and Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"8486","Only one criticism of our flight with Singapore Airlines on A380 The only criticism we have on both flights between Heathrow and Sydney is the poor quality headphones. The sort you have to squash into your ears. Emirates have decent proper headphones. We don't want to have to carry our own headphones with us Please consider changing them. Other than that, the service is wonderful, the food quite adequate and good quality","positive"
"2358","They'll get you if they can. I had already booked a seat in cattle class. A situation occurred and I wished to fly business. Well that was easily done but the only problem was that they would charge me for business and not refund any of the money that I had already paid for the cattle class seat. It wasn't like it was a couple of days before the flight but quite some time. The flights were very good and the new aircraft were fantastic. One thing that I did notice on investigation that all the flights were full, meaning that they had been paid for one seat twice. Not a bad scam. A couple of weeks before, I had flown business on Philllipine Airlines. The service was just as good and the food was just a bit better. You know that when they bring the food trolley around on Singapore the smell is always the same and turns you off. I have mostly flown Singapore with family and friends but will look at alternatives in the future.","neutral"

"10254","There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight.","negative"

But there are staff roving to assist anyone if needed. Late boarding due to the late arrival of aircraft but we arrived 30 min earlier than expected. I was lucky as I had the whole row to myself. Thai cabin crew was all smiles and helpful and they were always going around with drinks after the meals. I had to request for some snacks midflight and was given. The special meals I ordered were delicious! Legroom was fantastic. Only complain was, movies were limited. 107 movies but mixed of new and old. But I spent 8 hours sleeping and managed about 3 movies before we landed in BCN!","positive"

"9712","Downstairs economy in A380 was not comfortable at all I have flown Singapore Airlines a number of times and never had such an uncomfortable flight. The last time I flew on their A380 I sat in economy upstairs but I think they have since reconfigured and there is no upstairs economy anymore. The seat legroom was really constrained and my sleep uncomfortable (it felt like the seat was also perhaps narrower than other planes?) Aside from that, the bathrooms were kept clean, the crew was efficient and the Hindu meal delicious.","neutral"
"533","Expected a little better First time flying with Singapore Airlines on my way to Sydney, Australia. The service, the crew, the seat comfort, the entertainment, cabin appearance an cleanliness - all great. One thing that bothered me - my flight departed Singapore at 01:30AM local time en route to Sydney. After about 2 hours after take off, I wondered if any food service was going to happen. I walked to the galley and asked one of the crew and was told that they do not serve any food on the Sydney flight after take off, and the ONLY service (on a 9 hour flight) would be before landing. I thought that wasn't quite acceptable. Many, many passengers, including myself, had been travelling for a very long time and some food would've been good.","positive"
"7225","A little disappointing This flight was overall pretty good. I like flying with Singapore Airlines. I have to say there were a couple of disappointments. The food was the biggest. I was really surprised at the meal. The presentation was as always top notch, but I found the food bland, did not enjoy the dessert either. I also find it peculiar that SQ does not give business class passengers an amenity kit. On this flight we got a leather pouch with fabric treatment and hand sanitizer. This is not what I expected. The seats are great when upright, wide and comfortable. When set up for bed, if you are a tall person, you have to sleep in a position that is askew. I was in seat 19 A which apparently has a little more room as there is no seat in front of me. Service on the flight is of course top notch. Overall the flight was good, we left on time and got to Singapore ahead of schedule. I used to think of Singapore Airlines as the best business class in the Star Alliance, but I think that title now goes to EVA Air. The difference is the food, including the fact that EVA Air gives you a mid-flight meal great cheese burger available on demand. EVA also gives pajamas to business class","positive"
"7828","Great airline Have flown twice with Singapore airlines in the last two years. Manchester to Singapore and Singapore to Perth. Competitive prices. Flights on time.

"6517","Nightmare Well, after spending an hour on the ground in Auckland waiting for the plane to be repaired we were due to miss our connecting flights however, SIA contacted our flight to say we were rebooked onto connecting flights. Amazing service albeit we ended up with an additional two flights and arriving home 10 hours later than originally planned. The only big disappointment was one member of SIA desk staff at Changi who was obviously close to the end of her shift and did not want to help us to the point of her being very rude. We were even unable to get her name. But she wouldn’t put us off flying with SIA again (unless we came across her again)","positive"
"3086","What Happened? I had always trusted and recommended SQ's quality of service until I boarded this flight. The crew did not seem to be fully focused. Our row (last row) was skipped a few times during service. Even when we requested for our food, the cabin crew mixed up our order with other row's passengers. From our seats, we can hear 'ruckus' happening in their service preparation area. There was only one lady who seemed to solo-fight her way saving their flow of service. What happened SQ?","neutral"
"11132","Adelaide to London via Singapore was my first experience of Business Class on Singapore Airlines A380, and I was disappointed. Food, IFE, crew etc. were fine (though nothing exceptional) but the seating was a big let-down. With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired; I don't know how old this particular aircraft was, but Singapore Airlines started flying A380's in 2007, and this one was showing its age. All in all, their A380 Business Class accommodation is in need of a radical update.","negative"
"10947","Bangkok to Seoul via Singapore in business class. Checkin in BKK efficient, fast track security and immigration took less than 10 min. SQ lounge in BKK efficient. Flight comfortable with decent food. Singapore Changi lounge good, with decent food and drinks. Long flight to Seoul with new business class seat. Seat very comfortable with lots of storage space and good IFE. Food was of poor quality and quantity. This was for sure the worst ever business class meal ever. I pre-ordered the ""Signature"" lobster thermidor. It was awful. Small overbooked pieces of lobster swimming in butter on a lobster shell. Served with limb overcooked asparagus. The breakfast wasn't any better. I like SQ because of its great service, but the food served on this sector will let me think twice before booking SQ again.","negative"
"9842","You Must Be Kidding Me Your website is a joke, stuck in 1995. It is an embarassment to the Airline community. And you can't operate flights on time. ZERO marks for you.

"1450","Two excellent flights The eleven hour flight from Auckland NZ to Singapore was excellent the cabin crew were polite, friendly and very professional, the little extras such as hourly soft drink deliveries allied to two good standard meals made a significant difference. After five and a half hours in Changi airport, were I took the opportunity to visit the 'Jewel', the 14 hour onward flight to Manchester was equally good. The choice of in-flight entertainment was plentiful and as the choices were the same on both flights it meant I could continue watching a film that I'd started on leg one.","positive"
"10448","Brisbane to Ho Chi Minh via Singapore. I personally prefer to look for a ticket with Singapore Airlines first before any other airlines unless it's a direct flight. there is no direct service between Brisbane and Ho Chi Minh so I was excited about my flight home with Singapore Airlines. Very friendly and efficient ground service. Cabin crew is the among the nicest. Always up for your request. Food quality has gone down as compared to the past. However, drink game is up from offering cocktails and liquor for economy class. I thought I would enjoy the A350-900 more but turned out I like the Boeing 787-10 better. Too bad that the flight with 787-10 was too short. Overall, Singapore Airlines will still remain my top choice if I have to book a flight.","positive"
"63","Give this airline a miss. A combination of delayed flights and lost baggage for all 4 travellers in our party made this an experience to forget. Waited at the carousel for almost an hour but no sign of luggage. Went to the baggage service desk to be told they already knew our bags were still in Singapore. Why didn't they save us the time and call us on the tannoy??? Customer service person then told us the bags would be arriving that evening and would be couriered to us asap. After 3 days of emails, phone calls and text messages to Singapore Airlines we finally received our luggage. My brand-new hard-shell suitcase had the lock broken off and was also damaged and squashed. I subsequently submitted a complaint to Singapore Air but was told basically to bugger off. Absolutely shocking customer service.","negative"

"1350","Flight cancellations, excellent communication and prompt refund Due to Covid-19 all four of our flights from Perth to Hanoi were cancelled.

Could not fault the service and looking forward to rebooking next year.","positive"
"857","Great airline, now terrible The service and seats were terrible, the business class seats didn't even lie flat. Food was mediocre and some inedible. This could be the worst business class I have ever flown. Drinks limited to white or chilled red wine. I also flew premium economy which was a total waste of money. SA have lost the plot big time!!","negative"
"5075","1st class experience This has to be one of the best airlines in the world. The service from the air stewardess was fantastic. They would pay extra special attention to my 2 year old child making sure that she is enjoying the flight. There were also some toys given to her. The food served were delicious and typical type of drinks of Carbonated drinks, Juices, beers and wine were available. The entertainment were also great as there were alot of latest movies and dramas worldwide available. Hot towels were also served just before the flight. the flight was also safe as well.","positive"
"10321","When I checked-in online for this flight, there was a premium economy seat that can be selected even if I only bought an economy class ticket. I selected it and I was able to have the seat with no extra charge. I was pleased with the ground handling, service and quality of food. The Laksa was very delicious! The flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was top-notch! One thing that was not working is the Wi-Fi as I was only able to use it for a few minutes. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"6206","Take your own food Usually i cannot find fault with Singapore Airlines. I would choose them every time.This journey was the exception. The crew were not a cheerful bunch and the service was poor. The food was even worse! Cold, soggy, tasteless meals with hard, dry bread. It was difficult to get a drink - not just alcohol which I don't drink - water seemed to be restricted.Special Assistance was not booked even though I had 'phoned to double check before flying. Only two months before I wrote to the airline complimenting them on their service. Still, at least it was on time.","neutral"
"10510","We flew Singapore Airlines business class on an A350 Brisbane to Tokyo via Singapore. The meals on the Brisbane to Singapore were as normal not interesting but the Singapore Tokyo flight the bento box was 5 star. The flight crew were great. The Osaka flight on a B787 again the bento box was 5 star and all the crew helpful and understanding to everyone. The B787 in business class the seats were smaller than usual and the plane was noisy than the A350. The flight home Singapore to Brisbane, a passenger heard the crew talking that they rush the meals and turn off the lights. Well after take-off they were no drinks supplied but a rushed meal service which was not interesting (why do they not do a meal service that they do from other capitals). They did not even supply bottles of water after the meals service like on other flights. This crew were not efficient.","neutral"
"4037","Process rushed and cutting on the essentials Love the plane and the in-flight entertainment but SQ is rushing and cutting back on customer care. This flight was an example of the growing tendency of Singapore Airlines to try and rush their service and forget about customers wishes (experienced on Business and PE too) They don’t have a full drink service after take off preferring to other a limited selection of drinks. They don’t proactively offer socks or sleeping masks even on a 12 hour plus flight. Getting the attention of staff is increasingly difficult as they rush by and this is particularly acute with the stewards. I was offered an extra drink which was promptly forgotten. Eye contact is limited as they rush by. Generally I get the sense there is an attitude of ‘provide the basics fast, get the passengers to sleep and avoid engaging with them’.A shame, all process but limited focus on the individual.","neutral"
"1166","Customer Service Is Worthless Don't worry about contacting the airline because the dont exist. They have no customer service and don't care about anyone flying. I tried to change a flight and after spending more than 3 hours twice I never reached an agent. Just know that once you book your flight than you can't change anything ever. They don't have any customer service at all and will never take your call. I will never ever book with this airline again.","negative"
"11614","Traveled from Singapore to Zurich on A380. The Kirsworld entertainment system is excellent! but not touchscreen and must be operated by a remote which seemed old to me. The food served on board this Singapore Airlines flight sector was great! I was served two meals and both tasted okay no complains from me. The service standards from the FA is still as good as before! As this was a long haul flight toothbrushes and socks were given out to all the passengers including blankets and pillows. The FA's made lots of trips around serving water and OJ trying not to make the passengers dehydrated because of the flight. The FA's also forced all passengers to shut their window blinds to give passengers more rest as it was in the day. Overall another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines!","positive"
"3082","Still the best This flight from Manchester employs the Airbus A350-900 whereas the Heathrow option is on the larger A380. I much prefer the benefits of higher pressurisation and humidity with the A350 which do make a difference. Manchester Airport is very busy but efficient and less of a hassle than Heathrow. I have travelled with Qatar and Emirates but still prefer Singapore Airlines for consistency and connections at Changi.","positive"
"7376","A pleasure to fly with Singapore For years I've had to change flights when flying MAN to IAH, so the introduction of a direct flight by Singapore airlines was great news to me. But it's not just the faster journey time and the benefit of a single flight that made this journey great... the service provided by Singapore is simply light-years ahead of the alternatives. The planes feel so much better; they are cleaner, more comfortable, the seats feel more spacious, and the entertainment is fantastic. Unlike US airlines, all drinks are included in the price. And also unlike US airlines, the staff are pleasant, helpful and don't make you feel like you are ruining their day simply by being on their plane. Highly recommended... I'll definitely be using Singapore Airlines for all future flights to Houston.","positive"
"5494","Great airline to travel long haul Singapore is always my first choice for long haul travel. Modern well equipped planed with lovely staff and good food in economy.

"3433","Business Class Flight - First Class Service Seamless check-in made for a good start. As expected the cabin crew were most courteous, friendly and efficient, doing their best to provide a comfortable and relaxing flight. Food and drinks were of a very high quality.

Departure and arrival times were spot on","positive"

"5228","Services are deteriorating! 1.) Flight delays: SIA flights seemed to have more and more delays over the years. This time, they delayed my flight for 2 hrs and caused me to miss my connecting flight. 2.) Extremely careless Flight stewardesses: On one aisle, one stewardess smashed the food cart on my sleeping spouse's knee. On the other aisle, another stewardess smashed her food cart onto my elbow. I wondered how many other passengers were being hurt. 3.) Re-connecting flight: They promised us a bed of roses on the flight that they would take care of rebooking another connecting flight for us. In reality, they rebooked our flight only when we landed in San Francisco. That was not it. 4.) Irresponsible airport staff: The ""airport staff"" on the ground took us round and round with 8 pieces of luggage and booked us on a flight next day as early as 6 am in the morning without offering me a night stay of hotel. After I screamed at her, and reasoned they should compensate me with a night of free hotel to rest up before traveling again. The delay was caused by SIA, not other airline. She was obviously inexperienced and tried to push responsibility to other airline. After she disappeared for a while, she came back with a ""handwritten note"" assuring me the Hyatt Hotel nearby had a room ready for us to rest. She didn't offer me any confirmation number, neither for the re-booked flight nor for the hotel reservation. My gut was telling me the hotel room was not going to show up. True enough, that happened. 5.) Hotel room was not available: When I arrived at Hyatt Hotel, the receptionist checked and said SIA has not faxed over their paperwork. I tried calling SFO office, they were closed until 6 hours later. Thus, Hyatt cannot check me into a room. Thanks to Hyatt Hotel's airline agent behind the reception saw my exhaustion through the camera, he advised me to check-in with my own credit card first and he would take care of the business with SIA later. And he or Hyatt did. This shows Hyatt works more efficiently than SIA. 6.) SIA's reimbursement: Only USD$20 per person for this delay which was resulted in the mechanic problem of their flight's battery. It is not our fault. We were not reimbursed with the transit charges between the hotel and the airport. With all these info, you decide for yourself if these troubles were worth the cheap airfare they promote. Even if you purchased Business or First Class, there would not be any difference in their delays or the reckless stewardesses' ramping carts. Mind you, I am a Singaporean at heart living abroad, I have always proud of my own national airlines. This experience has totally disappointed me and changed my view, trust and confidence in SIA. If they don't re-train their staff, at home and abroad, their business will suffer. Their so-called promotional airfare is not that cheap after all. I need to re-look at other airlines for my frequent travel back home. It's my second nightmare traveling with SIA. Good luck to you!","positive"
"433","Cattle class seats really uncomfortable Singapore Airlines used to be great, but their standards have slipped. The economy seats are so uncomfortable. Their budget airline Scoot is far superior in this respect. Flights are often late and no one seems to care any more. The prices are absurd now. The planes are also rather old and tired. They need to get newer planes and make the seats suitable for long flights.","neutral"

I was greeted by FT who when looking at my boarding pass knew straight away that I had a special dietary requirement. Throughout the flight this FT seemed to have remembered a certain number of people's names in our cabin and spoke to us only by using Mr or Mrs as a prefix to our personal names. I was overly impressed as this is something you just don't expect in Economy Class. The service was excellent with refreshments throughout the flight. FT's were friendly and didn't disturb you if you wanted to sleep. A very comfortable trip with personal entertainment lots of leg room and a very high standard of service. What more could you want?","positive"
"2646","Singapore Airlines - Simply Amazing! Booked an isle seat while my friend booked the window seat with the hope that no-one landed in between. Found on take-off that the seats in the middle row were totally unoccupied and the hostess encouraged me to move there so I put all the arms up and slept all the way to Singapore. That is all I can say about that flight. Then - from Singapore to London. I had 'made an offer' ($900.00) which was 'unsuccessful' so my friend paid over $1,000 for the next leg so she could upgrade to premium economy and I had paid about $30.00 for a specific seat (I really wanted an isle seat as being a bit (OK a lot) older I didn't want to have to climb over two people each time nature called Then...Waiting to board the plane, for the second leg of our journey I said to my friend ""I am going to be the last person on so they have to page me and I will record it on my mobile, just for fun."" Then they paged me! After asking for my passport, they advised that they had a family travelling together who wanted my seat and was I prepared to give it up. Given that my girlfriend had abandoned me to go premium economy I now wasn't worried about keeping my seat so I agreed to give it up. THEN They put me in a 'premium row' with additional leg room!! The other two people advised that they were 'platinum flyers' but didn't upgrade because they wanted to use their points to fly their whole family on holidays. However, the hostess treated them like VIP's and it rubbed off on me. I got a complimentary goodie bag and lots of attention from the hostie. I may have drunk nearly a whole bottle of Baileys on the trip to London (OK I did) and stocked up on chocolate bars, chips and muesli bars for later consumption. It was an EXCELLENT experience.","positive"
"10343","Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with 'sorting' the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead 'proof' was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, 'designed for a reason' (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is 'mandatory' was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage.","negative"

"5060","Surprised by the service for a long haul flight This is not the first time I took SQ for a long haul flight. But this is definitely the first time I have experienced such poor service on board. I do understand that there are definitely new steward/stewardess every year. I believe there would be ample training for them before they started to fly. But I don't know if they are the new stewardess or have been there for some time. There are about 2 main meal serving and 1 teabreak serving. I can understand if you make mistakes for the 1st meal serving. However, each serving was either short of some cutlery or the food was taken wrongly, or the stewardess were busy entertaining themselves while serving. It just makes my whole journey unpleasant. I also do understand that the walkway is a bit small and these stewardess can bump here and there. I don't see it in any other flight, at least. Everyone said it's the best, and I thought I should give a chance again. But, each flight in SQ just make me regret more.","neutral"
"5485","They Changed my seat last minute from Bulkhead Waited 5 months to get a round trip ticket with bulkhead seating due to blood clotting Disorders. Finally got middle row bulkhead. Then at last minute they switched me and did not seem to care about my medical condition that could result in DVTs and Pulmonary embolisms on this 18 hour flight. They asked for medical proof, which was sent, and they then ignored the medical need. So so very disappointed. They know I am very prone to blood clots and have a high probability of getting one yet they gave. Away the special seat that would prevent such a problem, a seat I waited for months to get . Also separated me from my wife when they switched my seat. So for 18 hours we are now at opposite ends of the plane.","negative"

"10895","Manchester to Houston. 30th anniversary included a bucket list experience on Singapore Airlines new A350-900 aircraft. The experience was fantastic, the service superb, and Singapore Airlines lived up to its ranking. The cabin is so quiet and the seats are the widest. Lie flat seat provides enough space for my 6ft plus frame, even if I did have to tilt a little to fit my feet in the slot. IFE was full of movies on a great screen and the food was delicious, especially Tiramisu. Don't miss the Singapore Sling, the signature cocktail of the airline. Only negative is that the cabin can tend to be warm, and there are no individual vent controls to adjust comfort levels.","positive"
"8032","Fab New Seats Loved the new A380 seat design. So much easier to decoy the bed.

The meal has no menu (WiFi version didn’t work) and there are no branded products on the tray. Alcohol is available but only on request. Drinks are served without snacks or a napkin. Mid flight snacks are available. IFE is poor compared to other premium carriers. Crew were immaculate and excellent as always. Good VFM ticket too.","neutral"

"1241","Flights are great but the customer service dpt. is a crap My experience of the customer service call center was one of the worst. I needed to do two things: 1) change a flight date. 2) request an unaccompanied minor to travel alone internationally. When you call them, expect to stay on the phone at least a couple of hours. They are so slow, the phone line drops frequently, and they don't really know what they are doing. Keep checking your flight info online. Otherwise you don't notice that your request was completed. They change your flight date without your consent. The email system doesn't work, either. I needed to send a same single form for about ten times- they kept sending me the same email with the questions again and again after I have already returned the forms. After all, they did not have my submitted forms on file at the ticketing counter. It was a mess.","neutral"
"3370","Long haul great service I would always choose Singapore Airlines for long haul. The staff are friendly, attentive and helpful, always with a smile in their beautiful outfits.

"5764","The way to travel. We mostly fly with Singapore Airlines as we feel they are one of the best. We booked Premium Economy for extra space. When we booked there was a special offer where we were able to ""Book the Cook"". This meant we had first class food and was served first. Haven't flown for three years and must say that Singapore Airlines have updated their entertainment system with so much more ....films, music and games. The stewardesses/stewards are always obliging in making your flight as comfortable as possible. I would definitely recommend flying with Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"4826","Surprisingly Disappointing The seat was only ok since it only reclines up to about 40 degrees. The leg room when the legrest was raised is rather small, and I'm not even very big (175cm 72kg). When the seat was folded down into a bed, you end up lying diagonal to the screen and into an even smaller footwell. In the entire ~36 hours of flight time, I don't think I ever found a comfortable position to fall asleep in. Everything just felt very un-ergonomic and just wrong in general. The only positive feedback about the seats would be the many compartments available to store your belongings. I ordered the Halal meal, which ended up being tasteless Indian food (i.e. Tasteless briyani with Tasteless unrecognisable Indian bread and something they try to pass as Curry) for ALL the services. I am sorely disappointed that SQ is not capable of providing decent halal meals like Emirates, Qatar or Malaysian airlines. Heck, even KLM does better. I would think they would be better off just serving me Vegan food instead. Both the ""halal"" dessert and normal service dessert were very underwhelming. The inflight entertainment was good and I liked that you're able to sync it to your account to resume on other SQ flights. However, both my seat and neighbouring seat had to have our systems reset TWICE on the flight, which takes about 10-15 minutes. Which left me uninterested to resume watching and just carried on with entertainment on my iPad. Overall, for the price I paid for a Business Class ticket, I feel like SQ did not deliver as compared to my other experiences with other Business Class seats in other airlines including KLM, Turkish Air, Malaysia Airlines, Emirates and Qatar Airways. Honestly, this will not be a flight I will ever be taking again. I'd rather have a transit anywhere else and enjoy my flight, rather than take a direct flight from Singapore and just be uncomfortable the whole way. I did enjoy the Virgin Atlantic lounge in EWR but the lounges in KLIA and Changi T3 were a HUGE disappointment in terms of lousy food selection. On a more positive note, the flight crew were attentive and pleasant. They were also very apologetic when we complained about the rather insulting ""Muslim Meal"".","negative"

"6793","First time with Singapore Airlines Our first time trying Singapore Airlines. Very happy with our experience overall (as happy as you can be flying long-haul economy). Just some confusion over whether we had to choose our seats or whether they were already allocated. So I called the customer contact centre who said they couldn’t tell if we were already allocated seating together. The staff member then chose our seats for us for both the outward and return journey. The cabin crew were very attentive and courteous. Unfortunately they ran out of both dinner options on Melbourne/Singapore leg so we could only have seafood or nothing! This happened also on the return flight when they ran out of the omelette option for breakfast and only had seafood on offer. Not much good if you don’t like or can’t tolerate seafood. The seats were ok, actually better on the shorter leg, (Singapore Melbourne, Melbourne Singapore.) Would fly with them again.","positive"

"10995","An excellent flight with Singapore Airlines from Wellington to Canberra. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly, professional and attentive. The food was also very good. The seat was perfectly adequate for the three hour flight and looked ok for an overnight service. If I did have one complaint, it would be that the cabin was uncomfortably warm.

The flight for DPS-SIN were rather full and I enjoyed their Boeing 787. It was a short flight and dinner were served during the flight was delightful. We had a quick layover in Singapore for my connecting flight to Tokyo with A380. I sat on lower deck and the plane was merely full. They gave us light meal before turndown service, however a mistake was made by the cabin crew as they gave me a wrong food that am allergic too (I've never requested). I got sick during the flight. They kept apologise to me and one of the senior crew came to approach. They offered me a doctor service upon arrival in Narita which I refused. I got slightly better, but it shouldn't be happen. Despite of the allergic reaction due to their service, overall I was still able to enjoy the trip. It was just hindering me to give them a perfect score.","positive"

"5248","Singapore Airlines - Adelaide to Singapore (Changi) Business Class On arrival at Adelaide Airport, the check-in staff we helpful and as a business class traveler received priority express check-in at the airport. Once clearing the security checkpoint at Adelaide airport i was able to quickly approach the immigration area. There was a priority express immigration lane for business travelers and i was the first traveler through immigration and into the secure international departures. Once you clear immigration you have access to a duty-free shop. The Singapore airport lounge at Adelaide Airport is small but has everything you need. There are drinks and a small selection of food. Access to the lounge is via a set of escalators down to the lower level. At the bottom of the escalators turn left and the lounge is right in front of you. When it was time to board, i left the lounge and headed straight to the gate and again received priority boarding past all the other travelers waiting in line to board the plane. Once on board it was a very comfortable flight. The flight was aboard A350-900 (9v-shd) which only entered service at the end of January 2019 so was all of 4 months old. The air crew were all very hosptiable and the food and drink service was very good. This new plane had a large touch screen with a very good selection of movies and tv shows. This is connected to a touch screen remote so you can access your media selections while reclined. There was a single mains outlet for any power you may need (laptop) and 2 x USB charging ports too, which i found very helpful. There was also on-board wi-fi for business travelers which was great. There is a complimentary 30MB of data which lasted me about half of the 7 hour journey. There is the option to buy more data for a small fee, but i opted not to use this. The aircraft had approximately 40 business class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration and only about 50% of the seats were occupied. I purchased my return ticket on sale in March 2019 for approximately $3000 AUD. Baggage allowance permits 40kg checked bag and 2 x cabin bags of 7kg each. Check-in staff did way the cabin baggage at check-in, which i thought was a little surprising, but although one bag was over the 7kg, the other was not and they were happy for me to leave items as they were and just suggested i remove my lap-top from the heavier bag when boarding. On arrival in Singapore the disembarking process was excellent. Within 30 minutes of touch-down, we had taxied to the gate, disembarked, cleared customs, collected bags and checked into my airport hotel (Crowne Plaza). Such a quick and painless process. Highly recommend.","positive"

"7846","I wonder how brilliant First Class can be The hostesses were the nicest, most welcoming people and you could see they actually cared about you. The entertainment was very up to date, the seats were super comfy and clean. The bathroom was clean with luxurious toiletries. I had restaurant worthy food for the 1st time inflight and everything on my plate tasted really fresh. To crown it all they served beautiful ice cream on the way to and an ice cream sandwich on the way from the Philippines. From the point we checked in to the point we got off the airport, we felt like royalty. This is truly the best airline in the world. Flying economy and getting such amazing treatment, I am going to save up and upgrade to Business class on my next flight and be literally on top of the world.","positive"

"6393","A Rare Taste of First Class on Singapore Airlines The benefits of being a loyal frequent flyer and a full flight resulted in a rare occasion of an upgrade at the boarding gate. Hey, no complaints on a Sunday morning on SQ 211. While it was a bit too early to try the Dom and Krug, it was relaxing to soak in the pampering service and ample space and privacy. SQ does shower you with amenities such as pyjamas, toiletry kit, B&O headphones and customized dining schedule. I did soak in some caviar with a glass of French Bordeaux and reminiscent of the days when I was frequently upgraded by CX to First class....on one occasion to be seated next to Sting on a Tokyo to HK flight. In any event, I value safety and timely arrival over the class of travel but once in a while, an upgrade is well appreciated.","positive"
"20","Don’t travel Singapore Airlines or you have sick parents Flight SQ 241 - I was treated so rudely by the flight staff when we landed in Singapore. I had booked wheelchair assistance for my 76 year old dad has acute asthma and hip problems and my 73 year old mum with both knee replacements. I was told I need to walk to the buggy area as there didn’t have the staff to assist with the wheelchair. My dad ended up having an asthma attack and my both my parents were distress with high blood pressure. After such a long day for Dehli to Singapore we had to catch a flight to Sydney with two unwell highly distressed parent where no one cared to give them wheelchairs or any empathy. I am utterly disgusted with the way I was spoken to by the flight crew (a guy - I don’t remember his name) however the ground staff was not very helpful either.","negative"
"10967","Frankfurt to Singapore. Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it. They even fasten seat belts for passengers who were sleeping, never seen such care on another airline. Breakfast was served before landing and immigration cards were handed in time. At all times, crew were caring and meticulously dressed. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines and thier product. Definately my first option to Asia.","positive"
"6034","Good clean comfortable SQ never fail to make our flights pleasant. Cabin crew all friendly, cabin clean, toilet clean, in flight entertainment very good.

Wholeheartedly recommend.","positive"
"6333","Love the airline because of Virgin When flying where Virgin Australia does not go I fly Singapore Airlines. Some of the planes still need to be upgraded but all have a nice feel. I do find they need to recognize there other airline high flyers with a bit of a more personal welcome. The seats in Brisbane lounge need a bit of a upgrade but the food is great. If flying Business class make sure you go online and select the ""book the chef"" for your meals alot more choice. Lay flat beds would be better if electric but not hard to ask one of the cabin crew to sort it out while you go to the toilet.","positive"

"11275","SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!","neutral"
"5564","Comfortable Flight The flight is new and the service offer by the crew are excellent. The have 2 different menu, Asian or Japanese. Usually I will take the japanese set as they serve good quality food. New Osaka flight have a big TV touch screen. They also keep the washroom clean by cleaning them up regularly","positive"
"11278","Traveled 4 segments. HKG-SIN-SYD and return on a 772ER 773ER A388 and A333. Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.","neutral"

Me and wife were traveling with 1 year old baby and we felt like one of the staff was appointed specially to us. We are very happy with the service. Thank you Singapore Airlines. I would give 10/10 for service, but I have to give only 7/10 for flight as it was very old and noisy flight .","positive"
"5122","Premium Economy? Don't bother.... Saved hard to treat myself to all that Singapore Airlines promised for the Premium Evonomy experience and what did I get - more leg room, yes but I'm short so it wasn't the reason to book this. I was looking for all the extra service they promised and did not experience any difference from economy. The seat was hard, the headrest was broken, the blanket was scratchy and the toilets were not kept clean. Drinks service was invisible and the food was ordinary. Not happy. My advice - save your money!","negative"
"4220","Always happy to fly on SQ Always happy to fly on SQ. Service and planes are always good. Although slightly pricey, you get your money worth. I stopped over in Changi so that I could visit Jewel and it was impressive. I would reccomend SQ to my friends if its within their budget.","positive"
"1513","Boeing 777-300(ER) Premium Economy Extraordinary! Amazing service and very comfortable seat, the lavatories were clean and young/disabled passengers are well taken care of with special amenities. Although there was a slight delay in Sydney due to slot times, the crew was very informative about the situation. I strongly recommend SQ's Premium Economy on the Boeing 777-300(ER)!","positive"
"7309","Premium Economy is the New Economy I was excited about the non-stop flight from Singapore Airlines which we always have had incredible experience with. However, with the newly launched non-stop flight to Singapore, there are several misses which I felt degraded the overall experience I had come to expect from Singapore Airlines. While I have no complains with the seats on Premium Economy (""PE""), I am less than enthusiastic with the service on the flight compared to what I used to experience with the A380 on Singapore Airlines from JFK. SQ021 only has business and premium economy seats on the flight. This basically means PE is the new Economy, and it does feel a little that way for the flight as the basis for comparison is just between PE and Business. The plane is definitely smaller than the A380 and it feels that way despite the slightly higher ceiling. There really isn't much room to wander around since the PE class is all the way at the back of the plane, compared to the A380 where there is a galley area to hangout during the long flight, and a much larger economy class area to roam about. Amenities kit is limited to socks and eye mask, but on the bright side, they do serve decent champagne like Moet & Chandon. The Krisworld entertainment is amazing with the touchscreen and full of movie/tv/music options. Service wise, the crew was very attentive, though I feel that there seems to be less interaction with the passengers than the usual flights, perhaps due to the long journey. While the non-stop flight did shaved a couple hours off the journey, I think I would go back to the regular Frankfurt route with the stopover as it was nice break, and being to stretch and walk about for a bit was great.","positive"
"11356","We flew to Phuket via Singapore and as with previous trips the flight went without a hitch. The service was great and the staff worked really hard to satisfy all. The food was above average and filling and the drink service well above board.","positive"
"10987","Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding.","positive"

When your paying this much money it’s not acceptable. Amazing staff and food, especially book the cook. We had very turbulent flights and as a nervous flyer they couldn’t have been more caring. Absolutely not a bad thing to say about them apart from the fact that we weren’t on a A380 but 777 which is a horrible plane to fly.","positive"

Seats not comfortable and although a little more room than economy they don't recline enough. Vietnam Airlines and EVA so much better. Food was terrible.

Certainly won't be going to Singapore again!","negative"
"7635","Their warmth is world class They run their airline like their country. Quietly efficient. Check-in was quick, boarding was seamless and on-board overhead lockers are larger on their new aircraft. They tended to me pre-flight and served a delicious meal. If any passengers experienced discomfort with cabin pressure they'd alert the pilot and a more gradual lift/landing was exercised. I found the seats to be comfortable and roomy with a great selection of in-flight entertainment.","positive"
"5274","Economy never again! The slightly more expense to fly Premium Economy rather than Economy is well worth it. If you are only 2 travelling together, then the 2 only seats on either side of plane are perfect. In the middle is a 4 seat configuration. A much smaller secluded seating area with seats more like recliners. Large Entertainment screens, wider seats with more leg room. The best is the Noise cancelling headphones (not the earbud type you get in Economy). Even left it on when having a snooze as it amazingly cuts out all other noise. Needed to take them off when speaking with flying companion as couldn't hear a word spoken. Also have the choice of selecting your own meals by booking on line before flight (Book the Cook). A lot less expensive than upgrading to Business. If you choose to risk it and book Economy, you may receive an email a week before the 1st SIA flight, inviting you to make an upgrade bid. You won't know if your successful until 48hrs before flight. Did that the 1st time (2017) and were succesful. 2019 trip didn't want to risk it so paid for Premium Economy up front. Wasn't much more than our first bid of $480 extra per long flight.","positive"
"3369","Paid top dollar for business class. Horrible. New beds horrific I can't understand why the bean counters are able to make a decision without spending the 8 hours in the seat.

"5520","Pretty good, all things considered Flew back to AKL from SIN and after the flight up with Air NZ we were looking forward to comparing the service back with Singapore Airlines. We were in a B777-300ER which with Singapore's service has the cattle class seats configured in 3-3-3 meaning you have slight wider seats and better aisle room that some airlines which fly the B777 with the 3-4-3 configuration. Seats were comfortable and the in-flight entertainment system excellent. Seat recline was too much - the guy on the aisle seat across from me had a real issue with comfort as he was a big fella and had another big guy in front of him who reclined his seat full back, giving my neighbour virtually no personal space. That's probably as much to do with passenger flying etiquette as anything else, but a more restricted seat recline would certainly have helped. Staff service couldn't be faulted, Meals were OK - So much nicer they at least have you eating with stainless steel utensils, and not the plastic knives and forks used locally - so much better environmentally, We had a substantial tail wind coming back which was great given we had a tight transit time in Auckland. Much of this time saving was used up however as it took well over 15 minutes from stopping at the terminal to actually leaving the aircraft, as they let the higher paying passengers off first before the many in the back of the aircraft. It was pretty good service but I still rate their SilkAir regional brand as a better airline.","positive"

I called the customer service when I noticed this and they wanted an extra $1800 for us to change our tickets.

"6675","Used to care about customers--not anymore I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly to India from SFO. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight (like Emirates, or even China airlines, offers) and I have more than 50,000 pts. No offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C. While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my over 50000 points, Singapore airlines charge me for a whole piece. So watch out, even if you are just 3- 4 kgs over the limit, they will charge the cost of a whole suitcase. This is another example of not caring for customers. They can charge per Kg weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines do--no, they are special because they go the tag of 'World's best airlines' :(. Not allowing me to pay extra baggage with my points, no consideration if you are Kris flyer member with 1000s of points, they just don't care about you but want to make you pay for everything. Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore) and the bathroom cleanliness while going and coming was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for reasonable price, cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with more than 50,000 points though.","negative"

"477","Booking nightmare I had an extremely disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines. My holiday plans changed and i needed to make some changes to the dates and times of the flights, but this appeared to be impossible to complete. On 2 or 3 separate occasions i called the Singapore Airlines telephone helpline and talked to operators in the Philippines. On each of these occasions i spent 2 to 3 hours trying to undertake and confirm some simple changes to my flights. On each occasion the operators were not able to process and confirm the requested changes. I also (on numerous occasions) emailed Singapore Airlines with the details of the required changes and the details of the telephones conversations. From all of my attempts to communicate with Singapore Airlines i did not receive a single communication or confirmation in response. Incredibly there was no audit trail or evidence of any of my conversations with them. I checked my itinerary through the Singapore Airlines website about 3 weeks before i was due to leave to find that my return flight to NZ had been completely cancelled. I then decided to cancel the flights, but was incredulous when i found that i would have to pay the flight cancellation fee - this despite the debacle that had occurred up to this point. In the end i had to purchase a last minute, expensive flight with an alternative airline - which was a very simple and straightforward process. In summary, i spent and wasted significant amounts of time dealing with Singapore Airlines, had to pay a cancellation fee and incurred significant additional cost as a result of Singapore Airlines ineptitude. I have flown with Singapore Airlines previously and have found their aircraft and services to be good, but i am disgusted with how i have been treated on this occasion. On this basis i would recommend other airlines (such as Emirates) in preference to Singapore Airlines.","negative"

"10732","On a recent flight from Perth to Singapore, I was asked by the cabin staff whether I preferred beef rendang or western-style chicken for dinner. I asked for beef and was told that the beef sets on her trolley had run out, and I would have to wait. I was expecting her to get me the beef set from another trolley when, just seconds later, the stewardess abruptly placed a chicken set on my tray. She opened the foil to show me the contents and said that the chicken “looks good too”. Without further explanations, she went on to serve the others. I was bewildered by her unprofessional and amateurish attitude. Not wanting to create a fuss and feeling tired, I just accepted what was given. This incident might seem trivial, but such small things do make an impression and affect my decision to fly with the national carrier again. The crew members just seemed to be rushing to get their jobs done, and the warmth of the Singapore Girl that is so widely advertised simply could not be felt. Apart from personal grooming and the technical aspects of their duties, I wonder if soft skills and proper service attitude are sufficiently emphasized during their training.","negative"

"3426","Singapore Airlines is not the number 1 airline in the world for nothing I flew with Singapore Airlines from Cape Town to Phuket via Changi Airport. My favourite aircraft is the Airbus A350-900. The seats were comfortable, the legroom was spacious enough for me. The food was magnificent. The staff are very helpful, friendly and efficient. There were pillows and blankets for the passengers. The staff are very professional. I felt safe flying with this airline as they have an impeccable track record. If ever i must fly to Asia i will choose this airlines above any other.","positive"
"7900","“GREAT SERVICE – GREAT AIRLINE.” We had good reports about Singapore airline and we were no disappointed. We had a return flight to Singapore from London – in economy class. From the time we bordered the 300-380 aircraft, the service was ‘brilliant’. Helpful and Cheerful stewards. A good amount of space for an economy seat. The food was good with a printed menu from which to choose. The staff [including the male stewards] had a really good empathy with children who were on board. I would travel with this airline again.","positive"
"539","Not so World Class! No so 6 Star Hospatility! I recently flew on flight SQ241 from Singapore to Sydney. Being Thailand based, I fly very often on this route and the carrier I use are mainly Thai Airways or Singapore Airlines. On my several occasions flying on Singapore Airlines, I experience the same reoccurring nightmare on my inflight experience in economy class that I question their sequence of service in this cabin. I am not a fussy nor needy traveler, but I have year of travel experience to give an opinion. This nightmare has become unbearable for me and want to share my experience. We all know that crew members attend briefing, and all crew knows the flight profile of the flight. SQ241 & SQ211 flights, has lots of connecting passengers from India. Lots of special meals, babies & bassinet requests, and wheelchairs etc. Flight often delayed due to connecting passengers. Understandable. First meal service begins from the front of economy class cabin. Continental breakfast (no big deal) easy on the crew, drop food trays on tray tables, coffee/tea/juice etc. Special drinks request is still manageable as crew often don’t stock various soft drinks in their trolleys. The crew must run up and down the aisle to get stock for passengers. Yes, I get it when stock runs down during service but not every time a passenger ask for soda water and the crew keep running back and forth. This part I don’t get it. I have seen in other airlines that I have travelled with has one dedicated crew doing drinks cart (including mixers and cocktails) and one dedicated to doing meal trays. The crew that does the meal services cart than come back to help with drinks services once all the meals trays are on tray tables. Some airlines have some form of liquid to offer you with your meal tray i.e., sealed cup or bottle of water or a terra pack of juice (something small) to tie the pax for the moment until the drinks trolley comes to their section for more drinks or special drinks. For the main meal before landing, the crew took a long time to sort out special meals. Seem like there was lots of confusion and missed meals for passengers. The plane was full of passengers from India. They are around me and I can hear their request/demands to why their meals are not served yet and are wrong meals. As confirmed by a crew member when we asked. I was served my meal 40mins before landing. Being at the front of the cabin, you are being served last because the meal service begins from the back of the cabin this time. We could have been served in a timely manner if your senior crew is organized with their special meals request. 10 mins into my meal, the captain announces to crew to prepare cabin for landing. I had to rush thru my meal and finish quickly. My request for a soda water could not be fulfilled (can you guess why…. crew were trying to feed passengers and clear trays at the same time, plus they do not stock sufficient soft drinks in their trolley.) so I settle for an apple juice. No big deal. It was in the last 20mins before landing that I saw 3 crew members from business class came to economy class to help the crew to prepare the cabin for landing. Stowing away passenger’s luggage/bags, bassinets, taking food trays away etc. Wonder where the co-operations amongst crews went in the earlier part of the crisis. We understand crews has specific duties to perform but it was a crisis in economy class but no sign of any camaraderie on that flight amongst crew. So, with that said, we asked to speak with a senior member of the crew in charge of the cabin (red kabeya) but she did not turn up. It took a second request that she finally came to have a word with us. She knew everything that we had to tell her. She even said that we know more than her and the crew members. Crew members attend pre-flight briefing, if you know that you have over demands for special meals request what would you do? Crisis management, getting help from other cabin crew when there is a crunch in Economy class. Is the senior crew in red kabeya afraid that her integrity be questioned or will she loose face because she did not plan her workflow properly? Or that’s our (SQ) procedure and policy, we are adhering to it! (Heard that excuse from a crew member before on other SQ flights to Sydney) So, in conclusion, Singapore Airlines over the years have hyped up travelers’ expectations when flying on Singapore Airlines. Even more now with this “world class” thing that we see advertised all over the world. It is very difficult to be reasonable and forgiving even in the smallest glitch that may occur, be it the service or the hardware. It’s supposed to be “world class” and that is everything you do; it’s supposed to be perfection. It’s supposed to be 6-star hospitality. With no help from social media, lots of good and bad comments are floating out there, some are legit, and some are just pure unreasonable. I am sure you have a team to look at those to decipher and respond. Personally, I will refrain from flying this route on Singapore Airlines. One less passenger/s will not make a difference to your company’s profitability. One less passenger/s will not make any difference to how “world class” you want to be. It has been an experience/s over time that is unforgettable.","negative"

"7128","This is Nightmare!!!! We had!! a booking in Singapore to Lombok and back (on 10 February to 17 in February). A morning when I woke up, an email arrived, that somebody-somhow deleted our booking and we get back the money also, although we didn't want that!!!! We have to fly there, because there are programs and accommodation reservations, what we cannot and don't want to cancel! Since then, two weeks have passed, we wrote more emails, but besides the automatic replay and they we asked for the patinece, I didn't get any answer and solution about what happened. We need this tickets, but the price now much higher, like when we bought it. It is becoming a nightmare! We are about to go, on holiday and have no tickets, but we bought it on time.... Of course I could buy the ticket again, but at a much higher price! But I don't want, because I bought in the right time. I will travel 10,000 kilometers to Singapore to travel to Lombok from there.

"1313","Left Stranded abroad by Singapore Airlines, with no help or refund I paid for a return flights from London to Brisbane in August 2019 through The People's travel agent in London.I was scheduled to return home on the 7th of May 2020 via Singapore. However,I received an email from Singapore Airlines on 20th of April 2020 to say my return flights were cancelled. Singapore Airlines had been extremely unhelpful to me, I was left stranded. No alternate flight was arranged nor any support or assistance provided by airline or travel agent. I had to buy a separate ticket from Qatar Airline in order to return home safely on 7th of May 2020! I had no refund even though I wrote to the CEO of Singapore Airlines (Mr Goh) in May 2020 to complain which was totally ignored. Singapore Airlines provides very poor customer care and services. I will not travel by Singapore Airlines again and will not use the travel agent.","negative"

They are very accommodating for children so the trip with our 8 months went really smoothly! Did not use the entertainment system but from seeing other use it looked good. One bad thing is that you have to get of in Moscow and take all your carry on and go through security. But it was fast and they did not take our water or baby food.","positive"

"3017","First time. Not the last. I have always known that Singapore are good but I have never before flown on an airline where a steward comes out of the rear galley with a tray of beers offering them out to thirsty flyers like myself. The service was everything I expected and more. Nothing really to add. They aren't a five star airline for nothing. One tiny problem. I was cold on all four A350 flights. First time I've used an airline blanket. Next time I'll bring an extra sweater. As long as their prices are competitive they will be the number one choice.","positive"

Seats are not amazing but tell me an airline whose economy seats are comfortable after 13 hours. Overall a bearable experience with totally professional staff who do a great job.","positive"
"10352","Best aircraft in the fleet! I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. It’s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare. I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again.","negative"

"7323","Appalling experience We were on our last leg of an incredible world tour with star alliance flying from Brisbane to Australia. To start with we were the only two people at the check in counter & yet it took the lady at least 45 minutes to check us in. All this while she chatted mindlessly about her career, family in Indore and her interview with Emirates. She was incompetent of doing a regular check in as the guy on the other counter helped her with all the formalities, while she made no effort whatsoever. She then assured us that the plane was 2-3-2 configuration and that no one was sitting with us. We checked online and the configuration was 3-4-3. The lady said online information is not updated, what she could see on her screen was the correct information. Trusting her with this information we finally put the bags on the belt and made sure we would get the bags in Singapore as the next night we were travelling to Dubai. Once again she assured us that we will receive our bags at the Singapore airport. Another nightmare, we landed in Singapore & there were no bags! We were looking forward to enjoying Singapore for the only one night we were there but unfortunately spent more than two hours at the airport waiting for the bags. It's a terrible feeling when one person can wreck an entire trip.","negative"

"217","Excellent airline; would avoid playing music on board during flights Flew LAX-SIN-BWN (Brunei) on award ticket. Reasonably user-friendly website - able to book seat, special meal, etc. without hiccups. Smooth online check-in (boarding pass only at the airport due to document check). Very quick airport check-in. Smooth boarding process. Comfortable economy seats (better than average). Entertainment system with wide selection of movies. Free wifi, which worked well. USB ports and power sockets at each seat on the LAX-SIN flight. On the short SIN-BWN flight there was a USB port only, which was very weak and didn't charge my phone. Special meals were better than average. Both flights arrived early. The only thing I didn't like was the annoying music played on board the LAX-SIN flight for over 30 min prior to landing.","positive"

Food was terrible no taste and no much choice . In between there was no enough things to entertain the passengers in 10 hours flight so poor . Stewards are angry and slow in response","negative"
"10792","Paris to Singapore return in seat 41B (seat with more space against extra fee). Service remains 5-star, food, onboard service and entertainment, boarding. Have flown several times on this airline in the past in economy class. Boarding on both flights were swift and smooth with clear instructions from airline staff. Choice of food adequate with sandwiches/refreshment available outside of main meal distribution. On the return leg, the breakfast offering was adequate but not available due to short supply on board. I was forced to take noodles as breakfast while preference was for other dish. Boeing 777 seats are of good quality, only drawback is that seat cushion is quite short for a tall person with long legs and the screen is slightly far away from the seat. Movie offering is very extended with quite some recent movies in different languages. (A380 is more comfortable). Seats 41A & B are best, avoid 41C which passenger was hit all the time by transiting galleys As usual Changi airport is fabulous airport even with a transit time of 4 hours with next connection: gardens, swimming pool, butterfly and movie area is unique, European airports should learn and copy.","positive"
"11113","Flew Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore. I found the flight very enjoyable and on par with previous flights with Singapore Airlines. Check in on both the going and return trip was smooth and pleasant. The theme was reflected across the rest of the flight meaning at no point was I left feeling stressed or perturbed. I especially enjoyed the return flight from SIN to DXB since they had used a newly refurbished 777-300ER which had all the new bells and whistles, incl. touch screen IFE and refreshed seats. While I did not use the in-flight Wi-fi, it was good to know it was available and operating.","positive"

Once the plane was fully loaded we did note that all the premium economy and first class seats were not full. We thought it odd that lower bids were not accepted.

LH Senator Lounge very unimpressive - I don't expect to have to pay for Spa treatments when flying in F class.

WiFi absolutely crap - 100 MB limit for free service and took almost 40 mins to download an 11 MB file. Asked for additional data and was told I had to purchase it - not impressed!

It was a very long flight but I really did not mind it. Actually, it was really good. This January, I couldn't find a cheap flight so I flew Cathay from JFK to Hongkong (heading to Philippines on both flights). It was like night and day. I'm traveling again in April so I picked Singapore this time. I think Singapore ruined all other airlines for me. The FA's are so friendly, neat looking, very courteous, clean restroom, and the food taste very good. Service is first class, even in economy.","positive"

And so is the food - the local fare of bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) is most comforting. But the wine offering is getting more and more pedestrian. Also the removal of malt whiskey (used to be Highland Park) choice from the list of beverage offerings for Business Class in a premium airline such as Singapore Airlines is in word - unbecoming","positive"
"6782","Good Experience Flew Singapore Airlines - London Heathrow to Singapore and in to Sydney. Stayed two nights in Singapore on the outward journey which was really worthwhile. Flew back with a three hour lay-over in Singapore which was manageable as we had free access to the Singapore Airlines Lounge to shower eat and rest. All the way in one day is however a challenge and what I would say is that paying to upgrade for that flight might have been worth the money as we were economy for all flights. Economy is still a good experience with this airline with excellent in-flight service and very modern aircraft - however for the 14 hours for Singapore to London flying West ... economy plus or even business class would be money well spent and easier all round.Overall Singapore Airlines are nice to fly with, staff and service excellent and worth the money.","positive"

"1233","Utterly disgusted, discriminatory and prejudice Had a horrible nightmare experience traveling from Vancouver to Singapore with Air Canada (AC) and Singapore Airlines (SQ), supposedly Star “Alliance” partners. The first leg of my flight is YVR airport- HKG airport by AC and the 2nd leg of the flight is HKG-SIN by SQ. After queuing for 1.5 hours at Vancouver airport, I was informed by AC staff that I am not allowed to fly as they are unable to print out the flight tickets for SQ and Hong Kong’s airport transit criteria is to have both printed boarding passes. They brushed me off at the counter and told me bluntly to go purchase a new ticket that does not involve SQ or go fly with another airline. I repurchased the same route on AC for YVR-HKG right at the airport but with a 20 hours layover in Hong Kong flying my second leg with Cathay Pacific. For some bizarre reason, Star “Alliance” partners do not have the rights to issue tickets for their alliances but AC can issue a ticket for Cathay. To avoid a 20h layover, I contacted SQ and was advised to get another ticket for my second leg, the flight I was supposed to be on. To my horror in Hong Kong, not only did SQ not allow me to board with the new ticket that I repurchased under their advice, I was also made aware that there is a White male business class passenger flying the same original route that I was refused boarding with AC7 and SQ883. Would AC and SQ care to explain what’s with the prejudice? Is it due to racism or a flight class discrimination? Maybe sexism? As I thought my nightmare will be over, I looked at my baggage tag sticker and it reads AC7 and SQ883 not Cathay. After spending over 3 hours with the AC staff, he is still unable to locate it in Hong Kong and we had to file a missing baggage report. I left Hong Kong finally after 20 hours without knowing the location of my bag and if it went on the same Cathay flight as me. After the torturous 38 hours journey, I was informed in Singapore that my bag is still in Vancouver and they have no confirmation when it will be arriving. Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, they told me that there is no AC staff in Singapore and no one will deliver my bag to me while I am serving my quarantine, I had to send someone to the airport to pick it up for me. No word of concern if I have everything I need with me, no apologies nothing just AC faulting me again for their mistakes. My advice, if you are not a white male flying business/first class, do NOT travel with Air Canada and Singapore Airlines. Utterly disgusted.","negative"
"9000","Not as good as the airline commercial Just curious about their commercial about Premium economy on their plane. I booked tickets to fly to Europe. The seat is not so comfortable, the food also not so nice taste, even they offer us book by the cook. The food size small, I think same as economy class. The cabin crew also not so nice like I fly several time before with SQ. I think the service from SQ is downgrade. They don't over us extra snack, peanut or anything else. It's not worth with the price that almost double from economy class. They sould increase the service from everything. Specially for the food...","neutral"

The seat itself is very wide and has tons of storage areas. I know many people hate the foot well/diagonal sleeping arrangement but I didn’t find it too bad. I am a shade under 6 foot and was still able to sleep for 3-4 hours straight, which for me is a record on a plane.

"595","One of the best private business class seats in the sky today I had high expectations, but I was not disappointed. Incredible crew, thank you Rebecca and Juanita taking care of me so well. The seat is 30 inches wide (10 more than most) and you have a side table that is at the right height with several storage compartments. The seat side wall does reduce the visibility out the window somewhat, but this was not a big negative. The seat was very comfortable as long as I found the right sitting position or it it could have felt hard. For sleeping you do need to angel yourself as your feet will go in to the footwell on one side of the seat in front of you. As for the ground staff, I believe that they were all subcontractors so I could not expect them to live up to the standard of the inflight crew.","positive"
"9841","Pleasant staff, very helpful We thoroughly enjoyed flying with Singapore Airlines a few years ago and our recent experience was still the same. Attentive staff, pleasant with any requests. The flight was great, very comfortable temperature and meals were very nice. My only issue was with the passenger in front who had no concern for anyone. Seat pushed all the way back pressing against me. Due to my issues I need to walk a lot and this seat impeded this. Very much out of the airlines control.","positive"
"10801","Johannesburg to Shanghai via Singapore. I always travel business class (though first time on SIA fleet) and conclude that Singapore Airlines is the best. The aircraft are up to date and so are the facilities. Neat, clean and comfortable. But, it is the staff that take the airline to the next level - courteous, friendly, helpful and efficient especially the cabin crew on flights SQ 479, JHB to Singapore, 10 Feb and SQ 478, Shanghai to Singapore, 28 Feb 2018.","positive"
"4266","A First class airline Excellent service from all Singapore Airlines staff. Seats are very comfortable and wide with plenty of legroom and room to move. Seats also fold out flat so you can get a comfortable sleep. The best seats in business class from experience of many airlines.Food is very good and staff will do everything they can to make your flight experience good.","positive"
"11345","Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and back. Boeing 777-300 on MEL-SIN had one of the oldest IFE screens I have ever seen on SIA (flying since 2010). Priority meal for other passengers around me meant I had to wait for ages for a meal. SIN to MEL was a brand new A330-300 and had nice IFE and dinner served on board was the best I have had inflight. Serving dinner in the late night and keeping lights on meant there is no way you can sleep properly. I will still fly SIA because of their hospitality and cabin comfort.","positive"
"10415","15th March I was meant to fly back to Sydney from Amsterdam. I was visiting family and friends and with COVID-19 I found it hard to leave. I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you weren't allowed to enter Singapore airport if you've been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just beforey, so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didn't have a choice of accepting that money or not. I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now they're saying they can't help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation. Whereas I know and should've had the right to receive flight credits instead for a flight back to Sydney.","negative"
"2341","Great Airline! Ended up bidding for the upgrade on premium economy, and ended up getting it for $245/person. Totally worth it as we were able to pre book our meal through Cook the Book. Also, seat reclined pretty far back, the footrest extended out, and the bulkhead on row 31 was real nice. Super service, clean aircraft, and great legroom.","positive"
"11358","Flew from Sydney to Zurich then Amsterdam back to Sydney. Staff were attentive and courteous. They worked very hard throughout the flight to keep things running smoothly.

"4144","AMAZING STAFF AND LEGROOM To start, Singapore Airlines contacted me before my flight saying that they have changed my seat to an economy seat which has extra legroom (due to the seat in front being missing). This was AMAZING as I had a very comfortable flight!! I must say that the staff in Singapore Airlines are very welcoming and are friendly. They also are very helpful during the flight as well as before departure and once arriving. They offer eyeshades and other amenities at request for economy and to get these you need to ask the cabin crew to get these. Our flight departed LHR at 22:00 and arrived in SIN at around 6pm. Our a 13 hour flight was perfect- enough legroom for my son who's 6ft 2in tall (although the person in front must also have their seat reclined for this to be comfortable). The food service was impeccable; staff were very quick at serving food and cleaning up so we could grab a bit of shuteye. The IFE was quite outdated as the screen was not touchscreen - if this was updated I would say this is the best flight in economy ever!! Also, it's quite difficult to see whether the toilets are vacant or not as the sign is too small and difficult to see from afar (especially when the cabin is dark). Also the passenger who was previously in the toilet before me did not flush the toilet. Perhaps in newer aircraft automatically-flushing toilets or sensor-flushing toilets would be good as this was a bit of a bummer (both metaphorically and actually😂) Overall, GREAT SERVICE, LOVELY STAFF, GOOD FOOD but aircraft IFE needs to be improved for economy flights to and from SIN - retrofitting may be a good option!!","positive"
"10730","Could not fault the airline until they cancelled a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong on 16th September 2018. This was due to a pending typhoon affecting Hong Kong. No refund is forthcoming. A small discount was offered on another flight at a future time. This is not possible for us. The pre booked hotel in Hong Kong is reimbursing us the full amount less a small administration fee. If they can do this why can't a large airline do the same.","negative"

"6243","First class overrated I took twice First. On 777 first class has one row and 4 seats, located in a small box crating the feeling of claustrophobia. Service is standard and not personalized, food below Swiss and Lufthansa standard. If you take Swiss or Lufthansa as benchmarks you will be quite disappointed. The flight from Singapore to Copenhagen was very late, absolutely no help for catching connecting flight. Something unseen for first class passengers on other airlines.","negative"
"7748","Fantastic Airline to Fly with The flight was to depart at 12.00pm, they had started loading Passengers and the storm started, but they still kept loading. Once al Passengers were onboard the Captain made an Announcement, that due to bad weather we were unable to take off. The Cabin Crew made sure we were comfortable, handed out drinks, and cool washers. They looked after us extremely well. On arriving to Singapore, we still were unable to land due to bad weather, once again we were looked after very well. Due to this we had missed our connecting flight into Bangkok, and they had arranged hotel vouchers, car vouchers, and food vouchers, but unable to stay overnight,and making my concerns of having to get to Bangkok, Singapore Ground Staff, ent over backwards to ensure we got on a flight, of which we did, thanks to the The professionalism of Singapore Ground Staff. We highly recommend Singapore Airlines for, Service, Food, Comfort, and most important cleanliness.","positive"
"11457","Flew LHR to MNL - to give some context I've done pretty much every route to Manila in recent years usually based on price at the time. I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.","positive"

"3738","Never Flying Again!! Our story is a very long and complicated one! For those who are interested please read on, for those who want the short version: I am never flying SingaporeAir again thanks to their total lack of customer service and terrible ability to follow up on issues regarding refunds and changes to flights!! Here we go: I was booking flights for my husband and I flying from Darwin Aus to London UK but when we landed in the UK we were going to the passport office to get his passport updated which would mean his name would change. I called SingaporeAir to confirm if I booked return flights that I could change his name on the way home. They said yes that would be fine as long as you had copies of the old and new passport. So I booked us both return flights!l for our first international holiday together!! On arriving in the UK we got the passport updated and sent through to SingaporeAir straight away to which I got the response, “No we can’t make any changes as it is against SingaporeAir policy” and that I would have to cancel his part of the return flight and re-book him a new flight home. After calling them for 3 days I finally got through to someone who could actually help me (all while on Holidays and not being able to relax and enjoy ourselves) they finally canceled his return flight and re-booked under the new name. I was then told to expect a call back from the refund team in the next 48/72hrs. This was on the 20th of August 2019. We are now at the 10th of September and after 6 phone calls and 3 emails I still have not received this phone call. Each time I do contact them I get the same response! “It has been escalated to the department responsible and to expect a call in the next 48/72 hours”... I thought that meant 2-3 days not 2-3 weeks. Now, for those wondering, when I booked the flights originally I did buy the more expensive tickets that said they allowed changes for a fee so we could make the necessary changes and pay the fee but still have a seat secured for him to fly home. Nowhere in their terms and conditions does it say they cannot change a name (same person new name). But apparently this was against company policy. Oh and lets not forget I was now out of pocket!! I paid something along the lines of $1,800 for return flights but had to pay $1,700 for a ONE WAY FLIGHT!!!!! For a seat he already had but under the wrong name now.... Each time I call I also ask to speak to their supervisor and have always gotten the same response. “Our supervisors are not trained in this matter and will only be able to tell you what I already have”. I always say thats fine I just want to speak to someone with authority and then they say “let me see if I can find someone” and proceed to put me on hold for an indefinite time hoping I will go away. I have waited 20min once!! All on my phone bill. I am lost with what to do now, I am out of pocket, could not enjoy my first international trip with my Husband and now will never fly SingaporeAir again because this is getting beyond ridiculous! Crazy thing, the flight itself was great! Friendly staff, good food and clean plane! Just TERRIBLE SERVICE from their administrative team. So because of that I am NEVER flying SingaporeAir again. NOT HAPPY!","negative"
"10234","We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future.","negative"
"7186","Flying 1st time in one of the leading airlines of the world I had just passed my exams & to reward myself i decided to travell to singapore & meet my cousins and spend some time to rejuvenate myself. While looking for tickets i got a deal from Singapore airlines, fares cheaper than Indian Carriers - i started thinking - this may not come again - lets just book it. Day of the flight i arrived at the airport early and the chcek in was smooth as well i wanted a window seat so i could take pictures while take off & landing, i was excited to see a nice Boeing 777-200ER waiting for me & rest of the passengers, turns out the flight was relatively empty & got all 3 seats to myself (WINNNN). Flight took off on time even though it was during the monsoons there was hardly any delay and soon we were climbing upwards & outwards from Mumbai Airspace. During the flight the meals served were good prepared by a famous Indian Brand ( had pre booked the kind of meal i wanted with out any additional payments) Once incident happened during the flight was i had asked the cabin crew for some beer to have before i had my meal, while pouring the drink the aircraft hit some turbulence, the stewardess could not pour the drink cleanly and ended up spilling some on my trousers & the seat next to me. She started to apologize profusely, i reassured her it was ok wasn't her fault. She went & got me 3 more beers (Double Winnn) Soon after that i had the meal & slept off, woke just before we were to land, One of the best airline trips of my life so far.... hope can travel more with this wonderful airline.","positive"
"1596","Gorgeous but not very comfortable We flew Singapore Airlines from Bangkok to Singapore on a Boeing 777 then Singapore to LAX on an Airbus A359. The Singapore to LAX flight was 14 hours and overnight. The interior of both planes was absolutely gorgeous. Service was fine, though dinner service on the flight to LA was slow and I did have minor GI distress the next day. The A359 had lie-flat seat/bed but it was not comfortable. There was just a small hole for your feet which limited movement and constrained sleeping positions. Also, there was a thin ""mattress"" but it was not attached to the seat in any way, so every movement caused it to shift. One thing I did love was that they had packages which contained a toothbrush and toothpaste in the lav.","neutral"
"9809","Nice but long Singapore Airlines has a good entertainment system, but all good movies from their list I have already watched. Food was decent but nothing spectacular for economy seats. The ordeal was online check-in, it should be open 48 hr before flight, but for some reason I couldn't do it online and called customer service, and even they couldn't help me. They just suggested to check-in personally at the airport, and as we did we received the very end seats in spite of the fact we arrived early for check-in. I am travelling a lot and it was the first time with SA, I have heard only great things about Singapore but for our flight service was no different than one from Delta, or Aeroflot, or Lufthansa..","positive"
"5757","Worst possible customer service after canceling the flight Tonight, the flight SQ 325 from Frankfurt to Singapore was canceled. We also had a connection to Denpasar, flight SQ 948, so one day of vacation less! When the flight was canceled, nobody from Singapore Airlines took any care about the passengers. First of all, we were handed over to security staff from the airport at 11:30 PM. They kept us waiting for 15 minutes in a hallway, without anyone knowing why. Then, all the Singapore Airlines staff just DISAPPEARED, like magic. Nobody told us anything about when the flight will be rescheduled, or at least when they will let us know about the new flight. I literally had to carry our asleep son throughout the airport in my arms (and Frankfurt is a big airport) together with the carry on luggage, because nobody even asked if we need a trolley. After about one hour after deplaning us, we also had to wait (at midnight) with our son asleep in my arms for half an hour in the cold, outside of the airport, for the bus to the hotel. Until now, it's the worst experience of my life flying business class, the level of customer care was even lower than low cost airlines.","negative"

And we've had similar experiences on some SQ flights too on recent travels. Comparing this to what it used to be years ago, standards have definitely dropped. This is just an SQ vs SQ comparison. By and large they are still better than many. Though Qatar and Emirates have fared better against them on recent travels. Food on SQ is still probably the best. I used to think the entertainment system was also the best on SQ but the said 2 airlines have definitely caught up and maybe even exceeded.","neutral"

"9088","Good airline but extortionate fees and fare difference to change flight I have flown Singapore Airlines (economy) to and from Australia and the UK or Europe on a number of occasions. The airline is invariably good, with attentive flight attendants, edible food (even in economy) and sufficient inflight entertainment for long haul flights. This time, on the outward flight the cabin was very cold however. I wanted to bring my return flight forward by 7 days and when I contacted Singapore Airlines about doing so I was advised that it would cost in excess of an additional £800 for the same flights at the same times of day but just one week earlier than those originally booked. The most that I was able to have this extortionate fee and fare difference reduced to was £475. As a result I elected not to bring my return flight forward and also as a result I will now be looking for an alternative airline for all of my future Australia to Europe flights. I am a Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer member, but this made no difference at all to the airline. Overcharging for a flight change is a very good way to lose loyal customers.","negative"
"4892","Singapore Airlines - Bus Class FRA - SIN On a 777-300 Business seats in the middle Row 12. In FRA SQ use the Lufthansa Business Lounge which was very nice. Good service and food/drink selection, close to the departure gate. Quite a wide seat but that's because when the seat is converted to a flat bed there is a gap in front of you to the right where you put your feet. So you actually lay somewhat diagonal. You also need the flight attendant to convert the seat to a bed. It's comfortable enough, but not as good as Etihad/Qantas/Emirates, perhaps the A380 is better, I don't know. The service from the crew was excellent, with a extensive selection of food, drinks (you must order a Singapore Sling for your after takeoff drink) and nibbles. The pilots kept us informed and all up we had a great journey. Priority labelled bags came out early which for some airlines is a novelty. I'd really like to try their A380 service !","positive"

Stewardesses really good and attentive. Looking forward to our next flight with SA","positive"
"9942","flight experience As soon as the cabin lights were dimmed the inconsiderate woman in the seat immediately in front of me reclined her seat as far as it would go. My seat wouldn't recline at all, as there was some problem with the chair. Measured with my fingers there was only 17cms between my chest and the set in front! Consequently all the way to Adelaide I felt as if I was in a low cost budget airline. I realise this is not the fault of Singapore Airlines, but combined with quite ordinary airline food it's enough for me to determine never to fly with this airline again.","negative"
"3200","Premium Economy - not worth it! First time with Singapore Airlines Premium Economy and the last! You would be thinking all would be better, better seats, better food, better service but not really. My seat on the first leg, Brisbane to Singapore, the remote control for the entertainment system was jammed in so hard from the last flight, had to do without it. Not a big deal really, but then the tray table jammed and 2 flight attendants to push it back into place. Then the footrest wouldn't work properly. Credit to attendants offered to move me into the middle row - 4 seats, but didn't like that prospect. Next leg Singapore to Heathrow on a A380 - toilets backed up! Captain announced 4 hours into the flight, but happened as soon as we took off! Really Singapore - this was a horrible way to fly! Especially 13 hours! Shocking! To top it off - when we arrived at Heathrow - our suitcases came off LAST and damaged. A little bit redeemed on our return flight BUT Premium Economy - NOT with Singapore Airlines....","neutral"
"714","Vomit covered seat and floor, causing us all to get Gastro! We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters chair was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. We then of course all began vomiting the day after the flight, having been sat in clearly a gastro covered area. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying ai freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place. Had I of known they had not logged my complaint on the flight, I would have asked fellow passengers for witness statements - but who would ever imagine they would need to that! Plus it has taken 3 months for them to look into this for me!! We will never ever fly Singapore airlines again.","negative"
"8111","Poor Beyond Expectation Long Queue at Business Class check in at Bangkok Airport with ignorance to manage the queue Your Gate is D2. Your Lounge is opposite your gate In fact the SQ Lounge is opposite Gate D8. If you know airports well enough 6 gates difference is not short, worse than that was time and energy spent to find it around gate 2. Responsible of information sharing??? At Business Class Lounge, food and beverage are available to eat but no service even at the bar with bartender in the middle. It looked like we beg for a drink. In such case just prepare self service style. Or is this cost control policy? First time to experience the whole business class service by 3 staff, trolley service like economy class; perhaps only containers are different. The effort to personalize is to address my name pretentiously and incorrectly before food serving to ask what I want. My glasses of wine and water were collected without permission. Never asked to refill even it is still almost an hour to reach the destination. Is this Singapore Airlines Business Class Service? Or Bus service??? To me the later one. #perhaps SQ has a lot of money to spend for PR and advertising to mislead. Only good is music #neveragain #singaporeairlines","negative"

Please repare the gate prior to arrival of the passengers in the hall and show your boarding procedure on a screen or signs!

"10679","Singapore Airlines is a totally different airline when taking the route Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, café or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure. It is always way more cheap going through DME to and from Singapore than through LHR, FRA or CPH. Avoid Singapore Airlines flying to and from Stockholm through Moscow.","negative"

"7751","Hard to do better in economy 2 daytime flights Syd-Sin return, Daytime sin-lon, o'nite Lon-sin. Had 24hrs @ Singapore en route to the UK and back. Total cost inc. choice of seats & 32kg baggage, app. A$1800 return. While these flights do not compare with business class, the day in Singapore is far cheaper. And Swimming in the pool was a far more enjoyable experience than taking a 2nd leg the same day and feeling wacked for days after arrival.","positive"
"235","Pleasant enough flight After a pleasant stay at the Silver Kris lounge in Brisbane it was time to board the Singapore Airlines A350-900 in their regional medium haul configuration. The service from the crew throughout the flight was great and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. I had ordered their book the cook for dinner from the menu available online and it was delicious but I was also expecting breakfast and they seemed a little surprised when I asked about it as they served other passengers. Seems on the 7-8 flight between Brisbane and Singapore you get a choice of dinner as soon as possible after take-off or breakfast shortly before landing which I wasn’t aware of but they did serve me a delicious breakfast when I asked about it. The champagne and cocktails served in business class were really nice as was the small amenity kit you could ask for which came in a nice zippered pouch which came in useful after the flight on my trip. The main issue I had was the seat itself I constantly kept bumping into the touch seat controls moving the seat and turning on and off the lights and TV screen which became annoying after a while, also I found the wing on the seat really made it hard to get a good view out of the window. The seat seemed to have plenty of storage but just wasn’t as comfortable for me as some other seats I have been lucky enough to fly in over the years. Overall a pleasant enough flight which was on time.","positive"
"3146","Service Great comfort and food. But the attitude of the staff leaves something to be desired. I know every airline has a problem with Indian passengers, and most of it is justified. But not everyone is like that. So a little less arrogance by the staff would have been nicer. On the Kolkata to Auckland sector where we traveled Silk Air and Air New Zealand, we did not face this negativity. Especially Air New Zealand had wonderful staff","positive"
"11038","Jakarta to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. This flight was really good. The crew were polite and the meal was great. The crew asked many times whether I needed anything that they could make me more comfortable. The inflight entertainment was a bit old school on this flight but even so they have many updated movies and TV shows which has just launched. Overall I really love flying with Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"9085","No empathy for situation After suffering food poisoning during Singapore stopover (delaying flight by 48 hrs) my food choices were limited. I was content to just eat bread rolls or dry biscuits, but was confronted by head steward and threatened with being reported to the pilot for refusing meals offered. Food onboard was only for Asian tastes and not suitable for someone in my situation which I tried to explain but was treated with contempt.","negative"
"8231","Uneventful flight - just as it should be Nothing out of the extraordinary. Selection of the latest sitcom was good. I only found out they had the latest season of The Big Bang Theory too late and couldn't binge watch and finish up the entire season (I will remind myself to do that the next time). On a side note, just wished SIA will have more than one flight to and from Adelaide. Would have preferred to fly back to Singapore at a later time (This was a 10am flight).","positive"

"10104","My group of travellers experienced impeccable service on this flight. One of us fell became nauseous during the flight, and Eva, the leading stewardess, was of great. She managed to find us some vicks, which really helped stem the nausea. She also checked in frequently to ensure that all was well. Lawrence, the chief steward, was also very welcoming and friendly, and had an affable presence that made the otherwise long journey comforting. Cheryl and Maria, who served us, never forgot details. While service was interrupted during turbulence, one episode lasting longer than 30 min, they could resume where they left off, not forgetting details or requests. This was such a wonderful set of crew, and our group agreed that SQ long haul I'd indeed a cut above, and a great way to fly. Grateful for the experience. Pilots were skillful as well, and navigate the turbulence well.","positive"
"1091","Non-existent customer service False advertising states that you are able to change the destination of your flight by contacting their office telephonically or by email. It has now been two weeks and despite being on hold for up to 2 hours at times, not once has the phone been answered. No reply to emails. On Instagram they say they have forwarded my concerns to the relevant department. No replies. Our flight date has come and gone and still no reply. We are also due a refund for extra legroom. Might as well write that off. This seem to be their business model. Disgraceful!","negative"
"5508","Very Comfortable _ Premium Economy The Premium Class in our A380 was very good. Roomy seats & attentive Cabin Crew. We used ""Book the Cook"" & were happy with our selections. As always a huge amount of media to choose from with large screens to watch your movies or TV series from.","positive"
"8702","Best in the world! Despite having a basic economy ticket, I was able to get a exit row seat on all the flights (free of charge). SQ has one of the most well organised boarding process in the industry. The zone wise boarding is strictly followed. Nothing to complain about the onboard service. Through they are a little more expensive than some carriers, the extra money is will worth.","positive"
"6685","An excellent airline to travel with!! We flew 2 12 hour flights with them and the flights were great. Meals were lovely, nothing was any trouble for the staff, and it didn't seem like a 12 flight, with meals, snacks, and drinks. In fact, my husband said it didn't feel like a 12 hour flight!!","positive"
"1263","A350 economy Singapore Airlines are a very good airline in the air. Their business class lounges in Singapore are terrible and fail dismally compared to other airlines business class lounges. The A350 is a lovely smooth quiet aircraft and the interior is clean, comfortable for economy and the aircraft is modern and very smooth. It was an overnight flight so service was rather limited as was the food more of a snack, but the cabin and crew are pleasant friendly and attentive. I wish Singapore airline improved their lounges as they are such poor quality but in the air they are a very good airline and always an enjoyable trip. I have flown business and economy on Singapore Airlines A350 and they are both good products and clean, comfortable and this is a good airline to fly with.","positive"
"10487","Shanghai to Singapore. Shanghai is currently among a few airports that receive SQ updated A380 service. The new suites, only 6 in total that occupy the whole forward section of the upper deck, are spectacular. For comparison, in the same area, Etihad fits 9 spacious Apartments, while Emirates manages to squeeze in 14 First Class Suites. The armchair was very comfortable with thick padding, and the bed was easily the most comfortable I have experienced on a plane. The suite itself was so spacious that I thought I was sleeping in a small hotel room. Meal service was great with a lot of attention to details, though I did not find the food as tasty as on other top first class services, including SQ own old Suites. I probably chose the wrong menu item then (book-the-cook was not available for Shanghai). On the ground, I got access to Air China First Class Lounge, which offered both buffet and a-la-carte dinning, though I did not try those as I was full from a big lunch in Shanghai.","positive"
"8764","Not Fantastic Not very happy as now they have change their policy of paying seat as like the budget airlines. At times even you can't choose a seat for free within 48 hrs as they block all the seats. They are just by forcing you to pay for the seats.","neutral"
"1857","Great flights Changi airport has lots of amenities but I think the signage could be improved. The Silver lounge is very good with food and drinks available all the time. The showers are excellent with a towel and foot mat provided along with shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush, hairdryer etc. The flight was very good although I thought the selection of movies poor. I had tried to book my meals in advance but got and error message each time so gave and accepted the choice on the plane, which was fine. The breakfast sausage was strange and if I could have booked would have chosen pancakes. The staff were excellent. The bed quite comfortable so I slept for quite a few hours. The landing was bumpy but it was very windy due to hurricane/storm Ciara. I would always recommend Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"5559","Its the best airline in the world for a reason It seems so wrong to sleep in a business class flight that has the potential to check so many boxes for entertainment, food, drink and comfort. However, the wide lay flat bed is exactly the reason it is worth the extra. I love Singapore Airlines and will go well out of my way to fly with them.","positive"
"8906","Always a pleasure to fly with Singpaore Airlines !! Have flown with Singapore Airlines on many occasions and have always been amazed by their quiet and efficient service from boarding to arrival. Their crew do everything they can to make your trip pass without problems. Meals are always well chosen with good choices and they always seem to carry sufficient of each type of meal being offered. On an evening flight, once the meal is completed it is easy to get some rest before the breakfast prior to arrival at our destination. Their aircraft are always clean and well maintained. Always a pleasure to fly with Singapore Airlines - thanks.","positive"
"9870","Dispeakable & Deplorable act to fleece passengers! My wife & I booked our business class tickets which allow us to change our return flight bookings against payment of USD250 only. This was duly affirmed by SIA's ground representative at SIA ticketing office (Orchard Road ION building) when we purchased the tickets & is also clearly stated on their e-tickets + email confirmation. Yet when we tried to make a change on our return leg, we were asked by SIA's operators to pay the USD$250 PLUS a fare difference of $1000+ each!!! We told the operator that it is clearly not right, and we emailed SIA's operator our documentary proof, but she told us that the matter has to be escalated to SIA’s management who will revert only AFTER 48-72 hours; DESPITE the fact that we have to travel and attend to an important matter. We find the episode UTTERLLY UNFAIR, UNETHICAL, & RIDICULOUS!!! To-date, there is still no response and we are kept waiting!!! We are being held at ransom!!! We have on hand the confirmation that we are only obliged to pay the USD250 admin fee & NOTHING ELSE! SO we can't help but get the feeling that SIA is trying to FLEECE us. We really wonder how & why does SIA's management is so detached from the operations level, and doesn't know that its middle/lower management is sleeping on their job. How on earth did SIA managed to return to its #1 top spot??? There are ethical ways to make money, BUT fleecing passengers who have paid the price on a clear contract is certainly NOT acceptable or honorable!!!","negative"
"792","Great fligth We flew from Jakarta with a transfer in Singapore to San Francisco. The flight from Jakarta was 1 hour late but staff provided everyone with snacks. Really good chicken and pasta on this 1 1/2 flight. We had a 3 hour layover in Singapore and then off on a 16 hour flight to SFO. The flight was long but stqff were professional - the seats were comfortable - my wife and I had window and aisle with seat between us, and food was good. Lots of entertainment choices on flight. Dim lighting allowed me to sleep and adequate seat pitch (compared to United) allowed me to arrive in one piece.","positive"

The seats are extremely comfortable and recline just the right amount to get comfortable. The temperature in the cabin was maintained all the way through the flight so was very nice. The level of service from the cabin crew was second to none, nothing was too much for them and they were very attentive to all of their passengers. I loved the flight so much ive already booked up again to do the same next year....just need to save up now as I want to try the first class cabins!! Overall a very nice flight and ive already recommended them to several people","positive"
"4928","Very disappointed with the new A350 and premium ecconomy Last time I reviewed Singapore Airlines I gave them a excellent for their service and business class product. This time I tried their premium economy and what a huge disappointment. I can't for the life of me see where they can justify twice the price of economy for very little extra. Leg room is no better than the exit row in economy, seat room is slightly more than economy, service no better than economy and unlike other airlines there's no pre-takeoff drink. You do get noise cancelling headphones, (At that price though I'd rather use my own). You walk back through economy to use their toilet's, (what few there are), You aren't separated from economy as you are from Business. I experienced the same on the onward leg from Singapore to London on their A380. Use Air New Zealand for premium economy as they set the standard by being rated the best in that class. Honestly, never again. I'll avoid Singapore Air until it matches or betters Airlines like Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, Quantas, (Yes even Quantas).","neutral"
"4589","Review of Singapore Airlines The flight to & from Adelaide to Singapore was most uncomfortable, the seating was uncomfortable, with very little room. The flight to & from Singapore to Heath Row was a little better. The food was very poor quality. We will never fly Singapore Airlines again, & wouldn't recommend anyone else to do so. There appears to be to many seat's crammed into the economy class compartments. The only positive thing I can say, is that the cabin crew's were excellent.","negative"

"596","Premium Economy is well worth the extra cost for a comfortable flight The seat was the best way to travel the 7 hours from New York- Frankfurt. The Airbus 380 is being replaced by May 2023, but the seat should be the same on the other aircrafts the have. The seat was the best of all premium seats I have flown in, BA, Virgin, Air France -19.5 inches wide seat and double wide armrest, outstanding inflight entertainment where the screen took up almost the whole back of the seat. The set pitch was standard 38 inches but I did not feel that that my space was compromised when the person in front of me reclined. The footrest was in an awkward position as most are so I just left it up so I could stretch my legs underneath. The food was delicsous though the portion was on the small side. I agree with others, the ground staff was not up to par with the inflight crew but that was most likely due to the ground staff was hired help, not Singapore Air staff.","positive"

"7027","Economy service with a larger seat We were excited to fly Singapore Airlines for the first time in its premium economy class. I used the book the cook option ..tick. It started very nicely with us handed an express card to expedite our progress through immigration and security..tick. Unlike Cathay Pacific who invite premium customers to board at leisure, we were boarded with economy class on the Singapore Paris leg???? yes, really. xxx Having travelled premium on other airlines before we were actually stunned not to be offered a welcome drink as we reached our seats. A small detail but a detail nonethe less, and details are what you pay for when you pay double. Were also drank from plastic cups not glasses. The onboard service was very prompt and our flights right on time. The toilets became unkempt on all four legs of our flights. Overall a pleasant journey, but after reading glowing reviews about Singapore being the World's leading airline, I guess we expected the airline to outshine Cathay Pacific and Air New Zealand, but it did not.","positive"
"3920","No wonder SQ is rated #1 As part of a 6 flight 3 week vacation we caught SQ978 to Bangkok in Business Class. Whilst it was a short flight it was enjoyable. The 787 Dreamliner was new & modern & we had a far better experience than we had endured on BA16 from Sydney to Singapore in First Class, in their very old 777-300. With all the features in a new aircraft & fine in-flight service the trip was very enjoyable.","positive"
"1406","Comfortable Although the flight from Singapore to Manila was delayed for operational reasons,the Airlines more than compensated that with their hospitality and the delicious food. The communication was unambiguous and the satisfaction of the passengers was ensured.","positive"

The flight, the aircraft, the crew - fabulous. 10/10 The Business Lounge at Changi Airport... getting a bit tired and a bit busy. From what I read, there are better lounges than these out there. It was ok... but Business Class aint cheap and expectations high...","positive"
"11289","I travelled business class SQ218 from Melbourne to Cebu flight was great and comfortable. Had the new pod seats. Upon my return travelling home to Melbourne SQ237 was disappointing. The Business seats were tiny old and seat was at a very uncomfortable angle. A couple of hours into the flight my back was aching. I've flown a few times business class with this airline but this would have been the worst I have experienced. I think it's time the old planes are upgraded and the seats are refurbished. For the money we pay I think all passengers deserve a comfortable trip.","negative"
"7856","Excellent service and comfort Flew with Singapore Airlines for the F1 Grand Prix, not for the first time. But this time I thought I would add a review. As always, a class service and well catered for. Comfort and safety is always important to me and Singapore Airlines never fail on these. Anytime I'm traveling to Asia I will fly Singapore Airlines. Keep up the good work!","positive"
"6730","AMAZING SERVICE, VERY COMFORTABLE FLIGHT It's been many years since I've flown Singapore air and they still have the edge. Superb customer service with excellent facilities on board the air craft. The pods for business class have numerous little storage areas, the entertainment system screen is huge and the seats a pretty comfortable (although even for me a little short when in the laydown mode) I thought the headphones they provide were substandard. No noise cancellation feature so there was a lot of background noise. The meal was tasty and they looked after you from start til finish.","positive"
"11158","I was pleasantly surprised with our flight on Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Mumbai.

"4633","Singapore Airlines Excellent Service First time with Singapore Airlines...excellent service considering I was only flying economy class and had an amazing cheap deal on the flight ! The cabin crew were so attentive and professional. What impressed me was the way they always seemed to be cleaning, picking things up all the time aswell as serving on a busy flight. Usually when you leave an aircraft it looks like a dump site..you could have almost let passengers on to this one it was so tidy. The food wasnt to my taste but was nicely presented and a range of snacks including sandwiches if you were peckish inbetween ;meals. I usually fly Emirates but if I can get Singapore Airlines again to my destination I would book them first. My worst experience was Qatar Airlines last year - same journey - seriously never again !.. Service was awful..plane was cramped Boeing 777 - dreadful aircraft - rather go for the A350 .","positive"
"7700","Quality, legroom and baggage allowance The extra legroom compared to some carriers gave comfort, the quality of service, food and entertainment was impressive and the baggage weight allowance removes the headaches when packing.

Note, you are screened again at the gate - reassuring.","positive"
"11588","MEL-SIN-KIX and FUK-SIN-MEL in Economy with MEL-SIN on A380 and all others on A330. Enjoyable flights in terms of comfort food and entertainment although the seats on the SIN-KIX leg was definitely a bit firmer than expected. Excellent service from cabin & ground service on all flights with the latter especially friendly & efficient at FUK. Probably the most consistently enjoyable food my wife and I have had on SIA or on any other carrier in Economy over the past 5 years or so. The entertainment system is extensive with more than enough choice for us although the advertising can be annoying after a while. A problem I experienced with the unit on the SIN-MEL flight was overcome when a particularly helpful cabin staff member re-started my system several times and then checked with me 2 or 3 times after that to ensure there had not been any further issues. SIA continues to be our airline of choice between MEL and Asia.","positive"

"9703","Worth the extra $ for premium economy Booked almost a year prior to departure when Singapore Airlines had a very cheap fare to London for economy. Looked at the premium economy fares, $3300, and decided to splash out. The deal at the time even for economy included a $1 night stopover in Singapore, including hotel and transfers. I thought this would break up the long journey and provide a real bed for a sleep. One important point that our travel agent did not know/tell us is that checked baggage can be forwarded, e.i. does not have to be collected for stays of less than 48 hours in Singapore. Would have been much easier to only have to take an overnight bag. The other important point is that you are not met at the arrivals hall by a transport person carrying a sign but have to make your way to the Singapore holidays desk. This was a challenge to learn and find but there are many helpful airport staff to direct one. They then book the transport which meant a further wait of 20 minutes. The hotel, Crown on Royal, was clean and comfortable. Transport back to the airport was on time. Certainly made the 14 hour flight to London much more manageable after 8 hours sleep. The extra leaf room and seat width assisted also. The flight crew were efficient and pleasant. The food is apparently different to economy but like most airline food is not gourmet. They do have a system where you can order, in advance, from a completely different menu. I notice there is a similar deal being promoted at present so take a look if you intend to travel to London.","positive"

In terms of comfort, it is ok - not as good as the Airbus used for long haul flights. The compartment for legs is rather narrow, so could be uncomfortable for someone taller who needs to bend his/her knees. The food is good, which maintains the Singapore Airlines standard of food. Service is good. The number of drink services is not as frequent as other flights. Overall, I am still happy with SQ and will fly again.","positive"

"6614","Why SIA is Rated #1 Beginning in 1977, we have traveled extensively with SIA. Our experience is always superb but on this recent flight, we must relay our utmost delight in the services of our cabin crew. While all flights have offered impeccable food and beverage service, this group of attendants were most courteous and friendly. We realize that it is a difficult task to serve many disparate needs over the course of many hours while maintaining a demeanor of grace, elegance and charm along with comfort and understanding. Our cabin crew completely fulfilled this role and deserve, in our opinion, to be individually recognized for their excellent performance.

"8894","Enjoyable Flight It was my first experience with Premium Economy having previously been an economy flyer. I guess when you turn 60 you realise that a bit of extra comfort could be in order! Found the extra width of seat to be very pleasant and the understanding that tilting your seat back was what you paid for to be a positive contributing factor. Seemed to be sharing toilets with the economy group so felt that a toilet of our own class wuld have been better. Overall a pleasant experience and will have difficulty reverting back to economy class again.","positive"
"3400","No Improvement Unfortunately Singapore Air once my airline of choice, but no more. For whatever reason their very high standard slowly continues to decline. Even the standard of food is falling. You get boiling hot hand towels and cold hard bread rolls....maybe they should swap? The new planes now have the TV screens at a ridiculously high angle unless you are about 6 feet. On a long trip you have neck ache from looking up. I had a brand new 'Guess' suitcase that cost me several hundred dollars. on arrival at brisbane Airport on return it was covered in sever scuff marks that even WD40 couldn't remove, and had 3 chips out of the case. Many tours have pre booked Singapore Flights which I will actually request be changed in future. Don't even care if it cost me extra. Had enough!","neutral"

If I rated them they would go like this; Singapore 10, Air New Zealand 9, Swiss 6, Lufthansa 4. We also flew with Air Lingus. I’d rate them at 7.5 - this was short haul though while all others were over 11 hour flights. In future we’ll pay a bit more and fly Singapore the whole way. On Singapore Airlines we were treated extremely well. Staff were really friendly and helpful and it felt like they genuinely wanted to make you feel looked after.

"6968","Seats uncomfortable Try to travel business class on long haul for flat beds. These seats were wide but quite firm and after a long time sitting got very uncomfortable. Also to get the flat bed you can’t just recline but need to flip seat so you either have flat bed or chair. It’s not easy to flip between the two so not ideal. Much prefer the reclining type like Emirates or BA. food was excellent and service ok.","neutral"
"2897","Popular flight Flight timing is perfect, depart BKK at 1830pm gave us ample time to have a relaxing lunch and go to the airport at 1500pm and to do some duty free shopping. Therefore it's not surprising to find this flight is extremely popular with travellers especially those with codeshares. I did not reserve seat with fees so was not able to get window seats in this flight of 2-4-2 configuration, still not bad getting aisle & middle seat. Inflight entertainment and Krisshop were great, I managed to purchase one item with discount.","positive"

Sure, prices are higher but the difference in customer experience is palpable at all levels - from the priority boarding which really differentiates and works, through the (old fashioned) provision of newspapers and periodicals on board and the outstanding service, to the quality of the offering in terms of seating space/equipment and the quality of the products (Dom Perignon for example - BA used to have Krug, now it's Perrier-Jouet). Is everything perfect ? No, for instance in the take-off/landing position I found the seats rather uncomfortable even if they're roomy but overall SQ is a class apart and it starts with the crew who come across as really caring about the passengers by comparison to the hit and miss standards of some BA flight staff nowadays.","positive"

"3684","Outstanding service from 1 person made up for really poor service from 2 Booked to fly HCM to Singapore to Auckland. Requested a change to fly Siem Reap to Singapore to Auckland. Told no. Followed original plan. Flight into Singapore on time, but then told a delay to Brisbane/ Auckland as no plans. Probably 2 hours but no guarantee.This would then have compounded for us and caused an additional 6 hour delay in Brisbane so at least 8hr delay. Asked service desk 1 for option. Told nothing they can do in a very rude way. Changed terminal asked at service desk tthere and same rude attitude and no options offered. On the office chance walked to service desk at other end of same terminal. Guy couldn't have been more helpful. PUt us on a flight to Sydney connecting through and we got home at original time. Now that is service","positive"
"5660","A wonderful flight with Singapore as usual. We fly reasonably regularly to London Heathrow and we just love Singapore business. My wife now needs wheelchair assistance at big international airports like Changi and Heathrow and this is organised seamlessly. The lounges are comfortable well stocked and have very helpful staff. Seating in business is spacious and very comfortable with seemingly endless adjustments. The flat bed allows a pretty good sleep although I can never work out how to get it in sleeping mode although there is always cabin crew there to help me. The food is very good and beautifully presented. There is a huge entertainment library and the system is easy to use. Deservedly Singapore is always at the very top of best long haul airlines. We would always prefer to use SIA business.","positive"
"10676","Apart from my Mileage Plus problem, the IFE, crew attitude and food were amazing. They mostly gave me Salmon for my seafood meals. They were also willing to answer to my curiosity about the laughter coming from the rear galley. Another problem encountered was the Wi-Fi because I had to pay for it. However, neither the Wi-Fi nor my Mileage Plus problems were as big as the problem encountered in 2014. I can say, quite a big improvement in service from 2016. All in all, the problems (Mileage Plus & Wi-Fi) were much smaller","positive"

"10306","The check-in process at JFK T4 was seamless. We got access to the Wingtips Lounge, which was fine but there was nothing to be excited about. Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers (our A380 flight that night was almost full). On board, the seat looks nice and comfortable, though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive, something you would expect from SQ anyway. The food was excellent (I booked my main course from the Book-the-Cook menu). The flight arrived in Frankfurt a bit late, but not a problem at all. Overall, this is what a good flight should be.","positive"
"260","Tedious Manual Process for Redemption Ticket I needed to use all my accrued points that were about to expire from not being able to travel during the last 2 +years of Covid. The process of trying to get a flight was 100% manual, i.e. calling in to speak with an associate, and relying on the associates to verbally relay to you what flight is available. The website and app do not work. I have been playing with it for a long time. I consider myself to be a tech. savvy user. I had to call 4 times, and finally actually got the mileage redemption ticket via United associates who were able to identify the mileage redemption class ticket on Eva Air for me. Shame on KrisFlyer team! Singapore airline is totally overrated. Having a good in-flight service is only one component of customer experience. But having an outdated system that does not bring convenience needs to be highlighted when considering being a long-term value member.","negative"
"9664","perfect service In these days of economy travel where all frills are taken away, Singapore airlines is like a whiff of fresh air. Beginning with a great smile from the hostess to the superb meal which is absent in most other flights and the comfortable seats, everything in Singapore airlines is transfomed from economy to heavenly. I would anyday select Singapore airlines over any other option. The pricing is also great.","positive"

"1075","Badly let down by Singapore airlines We had always been told that Singapore airlines was a 5 star airline, so we were delighted to find out that’s who we were flying with on our holiday. Getting to our destination was great, but & this is a big BUT, our return home was a totally different story, we checked in at our destination airport, got given our transfer boarding cards & went on our way. Nothing was mentioned that when we get to our 1st stop off we were going to have to wait nearly 24 hours in Singapore airport, then after that we were going to have to wait another 18 hours in Frankfurt for our final flight. None of this was on our original itinerary & we weren’t informed until we got to our 1st stop off, this change of flights was all done by Singapore airlines & no one informed us on check in. Really poor customer service & no thought of our well being at all by Singapore airlines. I would dread to fly with Singapore airlines & would advise against.","negative"
"4550","Premium Economy great Flight leaves 11.50 which is great. Seats good 32 d & 32e and no one was beside us. They do serve a meal not long after takeoff, and then you can get snacks through the night and breakfast served before landing. Seat recline so you can have a good sleep. Staff excellent. The only thing I don’t like is not having toilets in the premium economy section.","positive"
"11068","Travelled from New Delhi to Manila via Singapore. The ground crew did not mention anything about the flight delay and did not bother to ask if we had a preferred schedule for our connecting flight. The inflight service was terrible. I asked for earphones from three different flight attendants but was only given one when I typed my request on my iPad. The food was nothing spectacular. The ground crew on my flight from Singapore to Delhi insisted that I have my backpack checked in and argued that it was too big. I have used the same bag on my flights with KLM and Emirates and they allowed me to carry it inflight. I have high regards before with this airline but sadly their service has gone downhill.","negative"
"6835","Just a bit disappointed We flew from Sydney to Singapore, Singapore to Moscow, Millan to Singapore then Singapore to Sydney in June and July 2018. Singapore Airline has such a high reputation and I had a good experience before. When I found Qantas did not have the route we wanted to take and as an alternative Singapore Airline had exactly what we planned, I was delighted. It was, however, not what I expected. Seats were ok but staff attitudes and meals were not as good as the ones of Qantas which I usually use. Qantas premium economy has better meals with real cutlery and staff treat the passengers with more care. At Singapore Airline, passengers at premium economy were the same as economy, just seats widths difference. I felt unfortunately it was not worth paying double the price for “premium”.","neutral"
"2802","Great airline with excellent staff! From check-in to disembarking Singapore Airlines were wonderful. The check-in agent at ORT airport was so friendly.

We experienced the same outstanding service at Changi airport all the way back home to Johannesburg.","positive"

I don't know where is my luggage and I am left waiting for it at home. Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines.

"1275","MY NIGHTMARE CAME TRUE... Flight bumped I had booked a flight with Singapore airlines to depart from London to Sydney via Singapore, which was leaving in 2 days time... It was only yesterday when they had called me to confirm I had all of my relevent documents for my flight e.g. passport so it seemed very positive. My flight was all ""confirmed"" on my Singapore airlines account. Not even 24 hours later, I received a call and a guy advised that I was bumped off my flight, which was only 48 hours before I was meant to fly off. They then advised the next available flight will be in 2.5 weeks..... this was not an option for me as I need to get home for work. They were not apologetic at all and gave no sympathy over my situation. This has left me very distressed and I will NOT ever be flying with Singapore Airlines again.","negative"

We chose 1 stopover of 2hrs aswe have 2 kids 6 yrs old. 1 month after we booked we received an email saying one flight on each way has been cancelled. The new flights assigned turned the 1 stopover into 2 stopovers each way. One of the connection allows only 15min between flights! Have they ever taken a connecting flight?! I called multiple numbers, emailed to multiple email addresses with no t a single reply. Simply shocking and extremely rude.","negative"

"4657","Some Singapore Airline sectors have terrible service The flight service was pitiful both going and returning. From the start the TV was not wotking. My husband asked several times if they could correct this - he waited for hours and finally gave up and went to sleep. The flight attendant then comes around a couple of hours into his sleep and wakes my husband up to let him know that the TV was working!! They give us a menu for food choices and then told us that they had run out of our choice at the beginning of the flight!! Why bother to give a menu then? Time came for drink orders and my husband asked for a brandy/cognac and got nothing. He waited very patiently but had to remind them four times before they finally brought it. We used the same airline from Delhi to Singapore and back - the service on those flights were fine.","negative"

"1087","Cancelled flight without notice Letting other travelers know to avoid Singapore Airlines after they cancelled one leg of my flight without any kind of notification. Now, 48 hrs away from travel date and school holidays starting, I have little chance of organizing an alternative. That's right, after hours on the phone they have no help/replacement and urge me to cancel the whole flight instead. Even though flights are available on their website - it is almost as if they would rather resell my ticket. I booked the trip early November last year and expected disruptions. Sure enough, two of the six flights were affected by changes which resulted in longer layovers - this is what I am prepared to accept. However, to leave me high and dry just hours away from the trip, no notice and no help is unacceptable. I have sent three messages to Singapore Airlines via their precious web form: no response; wasted time on the useless chat bot, can't open my booking online as they simply say 'to get in touch with an SA office'. Plus several calls and when I finally got through it became apparent operators are trained to deflect, not help.","negative"

"10990","Jakarta to Singapore on the A350-900 (9V-SMD). Check-in was quick since we checked in online and arrived early. Flight left Jakarta slightly behind schedule but arrived on time in Singapore. Flight attendants provided quick lunch service and two drink runs in a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). Even though they were still very polite and courteous, the FA on this particular flight were not as energized or cheerful as other flights we were in. Entertainment system uses touchscreen system that is very easy to use with lots of choices. Restrooms were clean. Minimum communications from flight deck; we didn't get announcement on which terminal in Singapore we will arrive in and local weather conditions like they usually broadcast before arrival. We have a connecting flight in Singapore from Terminal 3, so I asked several FA for arrival information and they didn't know either. I finally got the informations I needed on arrival terminal (Terminal 2) after looking at the system generated flight informations in the entertainment system; and even informing the FA on this.","positive"

"31","Best business class seat I have flown many business class flights on 5-star airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, and Korean Air. However, on long-haul flights, Singapore Airlines' business class B777-300ER has great service, seats, and food onboard. The flight crew is very friendly. They care about me and respond quickly if I request something. The food is really tasty, especially the Western style. I ate lobster thermidor, and it is one of the best foods I have ever eaten on an aeroplane. Besides that, their hard product is the top reason why I chose Singapore Airlines. I chose 11K for my seat on this flight. The bulkhead seat provides a spacious bed, and it is wide enough that my companion and I can sit together.","positive"

"5806","Do not live up to Star Alliance Partnership spirit A family of 6 travelling, 2 biz (paid), 4 economy (2 paid, 2 redemption). SQ doesn't offer LAX or SFO connection to ORD for 1 stop, hence we have to book separately on UA and upon check in, they failed to link up the final destination for our baggage and we have to re-checking through the counter again (instead of dropping off on domestic) SQ web recommended 2 stop SIN-FRA-JFK connection with a non Star Alliance JetBlue Airways, this is totally, this outrages that waste our time and our membership privileges were compromised. All your hard earned Gold Status are not put in good use. Why could not they do a better SIN-SFO-ORD (1 stop) connection with UA? after all ORD is UA hub? SQ do away with its own Kris Lounge in SFO. I strongly recommend, do not fly with SQ to US, they are no difference compared to others.","negative"
"10942","San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFO-HKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep. The HKG-SIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.","positive"

"10338","I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers, I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts it’s time to say goodbye.","negative"

We put on a bus to Heathrow after another hour. Nearly 4 hrs later we arrived at a very busy check-in. During this time we were given a sandwich,bag of crisps & bottle of water as we had missed lunch. We also had missed tea so were given £15 voucher to spend at Heathrow. Unfortunately we had to go straight from check-in to boarding they they were of no use whatsoever. We were told at Manchester that we could claim compensation. I had paid for extra leg room but of course didn't get that on the new flight (13hrs ).We arrived 10hrs 30 mins late and so missed a full day in Singapore.

The economy seats are comfortable enough, and the in flight entertainment service is included (unlike some) with a great range of recent options. The service by the cabin staff is always exceptional, and the food selections are good. This flight I chose a ginger chicken for lunch and char siu fried rice for refreshment, both good quality. The ability to choose basic spirits (or even a Singapore sling) as drink options is great. Recommended!","positive"
"10115","Flight SQ636. Our flight to Tokyo was scheduled for 9:50 pm 20/4/24 but the plane only took off at nearly 1 am 21/4/24. The pilot first announced that an Engineer was on his way to check on the plane as there is a technical fault. After about 40 mins, he comes back on to inform that the Engineer is still on the way and that a part in the plane would have to be checked. After another 30 mins or so, the pilot announced that there will be a need to replace a part in the plane with a nearby plane and that they would have to conduct a full shutdown of the power in the plane. We were left in darkness for about 10 mins with no lighting and fresh oxygen. There was more waiting till a further hour before the pilot announced that the part has been replaced and that the plane would take off in 10 mins - that did not happen for about a further 40 mins. Throughout the entire ordeal, the pilot sounded very cavalier and while he apologised a few times, his tone and voice came across as if it is just a game or that it was no big deal. Why allow us to board when the plane has technical issues? Why isn't there an Engineer on site at Changi Airport SIA is a local airline? Why isn't there ready supply of spare parts that you need to get from another plane? At the end of the flight, all we got was an email apologising to us for the delay. The least that SIA can do to show that it really takes the sloppiness as a serious quality issue is to give all the passengers gift vouchers or free miles. As an airline that prides itself as a top international airline not only was the flight experience my worst one, but the post-sale experience lacked any sincerity and initiative.","negative"

"5832","Traumatic Rescheduling Experience Recently I booked a ticket from Brisbane to Bangalore, however due to Visa delays I had to reschedule the dates. One of my Sigapore airlines ticket was rescheduled at a nominal fee, which was done through makemytrip. But I have faced a very traumatic experience rescheduling the one with goibibo. I bought the ticket for 38k INR. The rescheduling fee on goibibo website shows 3.5k INR plus the fair difference. Now here comes the funny part. I checked the prices of the ticket before calling and rescheduling and the flights were cheaper, around 35k INR on my preferred date. So when I called them the estimate first time given to me was 25,500 INR. The breakdown was 14K INR rescheduling fee and 11K INR fair difference. I will never know how rescheduling fee got there, neither will I know how the fair difference came in picture. When I called goibibo for the same, I was told that Singapore airlines can adjust the fee(apparently to whatever they want). And when I asked about the fair difference they said, that they cannot book me in the fresh ticket which costs lesser than my ticket, they will book me in some another ticket for which the fair difference exists apparently. Now the next day apparently when I got a call back from goibibo for rescheduling, they are quoting the charges above 1,00,000 INR. Can you believe it? The ticket still costs 35k INR. But if I have to reschedule it, it will cost that much. Here they are practically forcing me to cancel my non refundable ticket. And making me buy a fresher one. So much for the facility of rescheduling? I am attaching the picture of the cost of available ticket on the date I want it rescheduled. Now you decide what is fair? Or maybe learn that how one can loot from another getting a superior position. Do learn from my mistake and do not book such dicey tickets.","negative"

"8462","Strict airlines Previously I experienced the airline with a flight from Bangkok to Singapore, on business class. It was one of the best flights I've ever been on that time, especially when it came to the staff being amazingly polite, hospitable and soo welcoming. This time, we had a lot of unfortunate events! and some miscommunications of the ground staff! Was totally unexpected based on my experience before. I guess it wasn't our day! The flight itself was good, though again the staff was much different from what I noticed on my first flight, could be due to class being different! may be. The craft was a new one, despite the flight being so short but the seats were amazing, with great choices of inflight internainment to choose from. and Thankfully we landed on time.","positive"

The airport experience was a bit different with no express lanes to breeze through security and immigration but it didn't matter I was just happy to smell the jet fuel again.The lounge in Sydney was just right. Boarding was a bit hectic but once on board and seated in 24A I was very happy. The service was as expected, brilliant as was the food and all over comfort. Boarding again in December.","positive"
"4425","Could do better The service provided by Singapore Airlines is very inconsistent. I had an exceptional flight from Melbourne to Singapore on the previous day where crew were proactive and helpful, present in the cabin without being intrusive and service delivered with a smile, despite departure being delayed by an hour due to bad weather. However, flying from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 4th June 2019 was a very different story. The crew were, with one exception surly and sour faced. The crew carried it the first meal service shortly after takeoff and it was carried out so quickly that it became apparent that the crew were more interested in maximising their own break time. The second meal, promoted as pre arrival, was served half way through the fourteen hour flight- not really what I’d call pre-arrival. Definitely had the feel of providing service to suit the crew needs above the passengers needs. If you have the misfortune of sitting in seat 31C (Premium Economy) on the old A380 seating configuration, get ready to be flicked by the galley curtain every time a crew member enters or leaves that particular galley.","neutral"

"9656","Best in the air? In nearly forty years of flying overseas from Australia, this was my first experience of Singapore Airlines. I now cannot imagine flying with anyone else. We were able to check in on line and pre-select our meals from an extensive range. Check in was reasonably straight forward and an issue we had was quickly resolved. The Lounges at both Brisbane and Singapore were serene, uncrowded and very comfortable. The aircraft (A350 and Boeing 777) were very clean. The business class cabin in both aircraft has four seats in each row as opposed to other airlines that have seven. Thus there was excellent space and no feeling of being crowded. Each seat had direct access to an aisle so there was no having to climb over a fellow passenger. The only criticism had was that the seats were not 100% comfortable and it was difficult to find a position for a doze without laying out the bed. The staff were uniformly wonderful. They were friendly and respectful. Nothing was too much trouble and they checked on each passenger on a regular basis. The food was much better than we have had on other airlines in recent years. All in all a great experience.","positive"
"11304","I flew Singapore Airlines for the first time ever last August. Since then I have flown another 2 times to Shanghai return from Brisbane. I can not fault them.

The A380 between Shanghai and Singapore is great as well when I select the exit row upstairs. I will never fly another airline to China again.","positive"
"10935","Dusseldorf to Hanoi via Singapore. Both segments were truly pleasant flights. The check-in and boarding were well organized and quick.

"1144","Prepare to wait an hour or longer to contact customer service. Flight still good though. Traveling, especially international, is so unpredictable during Covid. Anything can happen and you can't help but worry. You or your family could test positive right before a flight, Covid rules of the country you are visiting or live in could change, there could be a new Covid variant making it more dangerous to travel, and so on. We booked a late Jan flight to Singapore in Nov to visit family for the first time in 2 years. Singapore government, although they added more restrictions and hoops to jump through, has a list that you can follow and you are able to email them and get an answer in a few days. Singapore Airlines, however, is almost impossible to contact outside of Singapore. I spent an hour and an half on hold before I was hung up on. I had to contact my sister, who lives in Singapore, to call Singapore Airlines from there. Even though they allow changes at no cost (other than price differences in fare), it is so difficult to get a hold of someone, so what's the point? Once you get on the flight, though, everything is great again. Service is what I remember, and you do feel safer on the VTL flights, where everyone has to be vaccinated. I wish they would enforce mask wearing more though, as I saw some people take off their masks for long periods of time, and they were not eating.","neutral"

"11458","LHR-SIN. Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes) I asked at check-in if I could take the later 2230 flight instead of the 2100 I was booked on so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it’s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it’s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone. I will manage my sleep patterns better and ask for some spicy sauce on the side of my main next time but SQ remain one of the best in the air.","positive"
"734","SQ 442 - Get a Better Plane for the Singapore-Kathmandu Route! The Boeing 737-800 had a business class cabin for 12. The seats must have been taken from a provincial bus somewhere in the 1970s and bolted onto the floor of this aircraft. They had no redeeming feature. The recline was almost unnoticeable, The footrest had to be brought up 6 inches from the floor by manually pulling on a lever that seemed obstinate. We had bulkhead seats - there was zero stowage; the pillow and the blanket were in our laps (unless we put them behind our backs and made our ride more uncomfortable than it already was). The entertainment system comprised an iPad with headphones. The food choice was limited, and the wines even more limited. One red (a cheap Chianti) and one white was all that was available. This was a 5-hour flight that was uncomfortable from beginning to end - to put it mildly. Couldn't wait to land in Kathmandu. And this was after paying more than $3,000 each for a Manila-Kathmandu-Manila ticket (via Singapore), Shocking! We chose NOT to fly on this aircraft on the return journey; didn't make much sense in sitting bolt upright for 5 hours at night when a business class seat should be offering you some semblance of lie-flat. Never again! This was a complete rip off.","negative"
"9496","A Flight Above The Rest This is a great airline. We flew roundtrip from Manchester to Houston and the flights both ways were exceptional. The crew are super helpful, the food good (as airline grub goes) and the Tiger beer welcoming.

The movie selections were excellent and I was really impressed that they handed out socks and toothbrush kits.

I will always pick Singapore Airlines if it’s an option in the future and would highly recommend them!","positive"
"5821","Whenever you get the chance, fly Singapore Airlines! A long flight made shorter by very comfortable seats, excellent food, outstanding service and very good entertainment options. We have flown on all of the Middle-East airlines and most of the Asian ones and nothing can match Singapore. The European and American airlines aren't even comparable. The planes are modern, the Business Class seat arrangement is 1-2-1 and compare that to an Emirates or Turkish 777 (both of which we have flown recently) which use a 2-3-2 configuration. The extra room makes for a much more comfortable 17 hour flight. This is how to run an airline!","positive"

I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990 when they had their 747-400 Megatop almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.","positive"
"9522","Another great flight~ It was as usual another great flight offered by Singapore Airlines and really no doubt about it. (Actually we only fly this airline) For this time round, it was punctual (on the dot) and yet arrived Taoyuan airport slightly earlier than expected. What made this flight amazing was that, besides taking off and landing where seatbelt sign was on, there was no other moment when this sign was turned on. The flight was very smooth and stable. Contents of the inflight entertainment system (Krisworld) was good though could be better and to offer more options (as like the long haul flights). Meals was nice and ice cream was served too. Cabin crew were extremely attentive, polite and helpful (we were traveling with 2 senior citizens) and they, from time to time, would walk over and asked them if they required anything. They were also very patient in explaining the meals and helping them to clear the tray after they finished their meal. We were as usual impressed with the airline, about its punctuality, smoothness of the flight and inflight service by staff and especially this time round, a great THUMB UP! Will continue to fly this airline in our coming 2 trips. SIA, you are a great way to fly!","positive"

First of all, they put us on scoot airways for the first flight, which appeared to be a budget version of Singapore airlines. The plane was old, had no in flight entertainment and was definitely not singapore airlines. Then after being put on a singapore airlines flight for the 2nd part of the journey, to our horror our baggage never made it to the Maldives. We put in a baggage tracking support ticket, went to our resort and waited for 2 days. We had to stay at our resort with nothing but the clothes on our back for two days. Eventually we learned that our luggage had been put on to a flight to Sri Lanka. How the f*** do airline staff do something so stupid? Then instead of sending it direct to Maldives from Sri Lanka, they put it back on a flight to singapore. We received no apology, no compensation and the customer support is impossible to contact. This airline is not worth any chance no matter how good a deal the flight tickets are. Apparently the resort staff also said that it is not uncommon for singapore airlines to lose your luggage too. So yeah definitely avoid.","negative"

"5205","my comments were heard? This is the return leg of my trip to bangkok. The first leg, there was a feedback request via email sent to me by SQ. I mentioned about the bread rolls to be warmed up instead on wrapping them in cold plastic bags that bloated up once we are up there in the sky. And also commented that the air stewardess asked me, ""what would you like?"" when i saw no menu in the poach in front of me and there was no form of any communication as to what food were available. Immediately on my return flight, i was served warm bread from the basket instead of the plastic bags. And of course, was handed a menu before i was served lunch. If these two matters were not coincidental, i would say that i am truly impressed with how serious SQ took their customers' feedbacks. As for the rest of the items on offer like in-flight entertainment and leg room, still the best that i had. Always if possible, booked my flights with SQ if the options were available.

They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall, it is an average experience.","negative"
"3802","Efficient, polite and high quality Travelling from London to Singapore it turned out considerably cheaper to go LHR-FRA then FRA-SIN using Lufthansa then Singapore Airlines booked as a single purchase Singapore Airlines lived up to their strong reputation and the A380 is simply the best long distance airliner. The Airline scored through the slightly bigger seating than its rivals and the efficiency of the staff. Talking to some of them they put it down to a family mentality in which teams often work together route after route. The food was ok without being spectacular but we all loved the free snack bar of fruit, crisps and chocolate that was available throughout the flight as a supplement The plane was 10 years old and on the outbound flight the handheld technology was showing its age but usable. Personally I found the film selection very good but the 20 year-olds said Qatar and Emirates was a better choice With so much competition on the route I would still be led by the price but when all is similar Singapore Airlines would be our first choice. A further benefit to us was that we were flying on to Borneo so the tie-in between Singapore Airlines and its sister airline Silk Air made the transfers easy. I understand that by next year Silk Air will be subsumed into Singapore Airlines","positive"

"11018","Amsterdam to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I had a wonderful flight on SQ323 to Singapore. The new A350-900 is an excellent plane. I had seat 52C, the leg room was more than sufficient. The cabin crew very good, looking after our wellbeing throughout the whole flight, even on a long 12-hour flight as this one. The food was delicious, I had diet-meals on all flights and they took great care of me. One minor thing: the toilets on the A350 look very small. From Singapore to Melbourne I sat at 37G. This was an older version of the B777-300ER, with an older inflight entertainment system and more important not enough legroom. My knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Cabin crew good, food was excellent and the 6 hour flight was over in a blink. On the return flight in from Melbourne to Singapore I changed seats the day before and sat at a window seat. This B777-300ER looked more modern and the legspace was much more than on the way into Melbourne. Again a very pleasant flight with a pleasant cabin crew. Only the last hour we had a bumpy flight with thunderstorms above Indonesia and Singapore, but the crew and pilots did a good job. The flight to Amsterdam left much later because of bad weather at Singapore, for almost half the flight we had a very bumpy and tiring flight but staff stayed polite and kept their friendly faces. My overall experience with SIA was very good. Next time this company will take me to Australia again.","positive"

We did not experience any ‘wow’ moments e.g., additional ice creams being served as we heard from other people’s experience. My entertainment system didn’t work on the flight back even after the air stewardess helped to reset the system. It was a boring flight back for me. The Singapore local special meal (fried bee noon) was a disgrace as It didn’t taste nice at all. Nonetheless, the flight was smooth and landing was great. We probably had higher expectations from this airline because it was SIA and the fare was not cheap.

"4195","Thought this was the No.1 airline Unfortunately our flight was cancelled just before we were boarding. We stood around for 3 hrs before we were put on a bus down to Heathrow from Manchester. We did receive compensation but we were offered two gestures of good will. Neither of which we could use. Two meal vouchers as we had missed the evening meal but we were given them as we were boarding. Also in flight gift vouchers were offered. We received these 2 weeks after we got home !!! We were told we could order things from their shop and it would be delivered to our home. But we have to pay duty & postage and can only select from a very limited selection. Great PR !!!!!","negative"
"10923","Munich to Singapore. First time flying with a baby so we were a bit apprehensive. The flight crew were fantastic making sure we were looked after, from coming over to invite us to board and making sure we have everything we need. The food service was prompt, staff came around with drinks, just before the lights are dimmed they give out water bottles. Flight left 5 min late but arrived 10 min early bags were only the belt when we got out of immigration. I was also told that from Aug 2017 the Boeing 777-300ER will be completely replaced by the A350. Only downside the hand controller stopped working to had to reach the bulkhead to change channels. As a full reset would cause issues for the row behind me and take 10 min I wasn't bothered, the staff said they would do it as soon as the others fell asleep. To their credit 6 hours later once the other dosed off the reset was done. Great flight, they will always be on the top of my list of carriers to fly.","positive"
"1152","Singapore Airline Refund I had to cancel my ticket as I had to go for an emergency to Colombo well before the date I was planning to go. I have cancelled my ticket in 20th Dec 2021 and today is 31st Jan 2022. I still haven't received my refund. When I called them they said that it will take 4 months to refund my money. Is this fair according to the Australian consumer law? Or Is Singapore airline taking the advantage of travellers like us.","negative"
"1210","My 16 year old son was stranded at LAX I always used to think that Singapore Airlines was a good airline until today. Even after submitting proof that one of their agents clearly stated that they would accept a PCR test 72 hours prior to Mt son's flight time, when my son checked in at LAX, the staff refused to let him board. They gave him a map and told him he had to get a new PCR test which meant he had to jump on a shuttle alone and find the testing station. He was charged $199 for a PCR test with a 45 minute guarantee. This is an insane amount of money! He then rushed back to LAX only to be told he was too late to catch the flight. They refused to issue him a boarding pass even though there was still 35 minutes to spare and he had no bags to check in. They did offer to rebook him on snap alternative flight which meant he would have to spend 14+ hours in the airport. Then he was told that he had to get a guardian to sign a permission form because he was under 18 and traveling alone. There was no humanity in the way staff dealt with this situation. Sll they cared about was following insane rules which ultimately made no sense since my son was only going to transit through Singapore en route to Jakarta. The fact that he submitted a voice memo of a staff member clearly stating he could definitely transit through Singapore with a PCR test taken 72 hours pretty flight made absolutely no difference to Singapore Airlines' staff. We believed that this woman had told us the truth, but ultimately my son paid the price as did I. The incredible stress and anxiety caused by Singapore Airlines policies and unwillingness to acknowledge this staff's recording as clear proof, has not only cost me financially, but emotionally and mentally. My son had to go through an ordeal which was incredibly stressful and challenging on all levels. Afterwards, I contacted Singapore Airlines asking for compensation. Several staff promised to get back to me but they never did. 3 phone calls later, I was told by Lloyd, a supervisor based in the Philippines, that Singapore Airlines would not compensate me. There was no accountability from SIA for their egregious mistake. It's for these reasons and more, that my family nor I will never fly on Singapore airlines again.","negative"
"4238","Comfortable journey It was my first time with Singapore airlines and the flight was amazing! Although we had booked economy class tickets, the seat was extremely comfortable. the cabin crew had a superb standard of service. We were given snacks, dinner and refreshments. Also, a pair of pressure balancing socks and a set of toothbrush and tooth paste. The collection of movies, tv shows and games was good.","positive"
"6093","Comfortable flying We hadn't flown with Singapore Airlines for several years due to a run of bad experiences with them. It didn't start off well this time either when our chosen seats pre-flight disappeared due to the introduction of a brand new plane. We received an advisory email but the new seats were not extra leg room and also down the back of the plane. To choose new seats cost us an extra $200+. Not good! However, on the day of departure the check-in was smooth and the counter staff member very polite, efficient and obliging. Boarding was smooth and hassle-free and the cabin staff bright, helpful, full of smiles and efficient. This set the tone for the entire flight. The seats were comfortable (something lacking when we last flew with them). The entertainment options were great, food and drink delivery super efficient and the meals tasty, plentiful and hot. Singapore actually measured up very well against Emirates and we will put them to the test again when next we fly overseas. Well done Singapore Airlines!","positive"
"3423","Nightmare experience with a flight journey operated by Singapore Airlines/ Silk Air A flight journey of 22 hrs 35 minutes involving a single stop, became a 46 hrs 22 minutes involving 3 stops eventually. Our original flight was from Hyderabad to Seattle via Singapore. * Hyderabad -> Singapore: Silk Air * 3:15 layover in Singapore * Singapore -> Seattle: Singapore Airlines Total journey time: 22 hours 35 minutes The initial flight from Hyderabad -> Singapore operated by Silk Air was delayed by more than 3 hours and 25 minutes, and hence our entire flight needed to be rebooked. No one gave us a specific reason why the flight got delayed, except the statement: ""the incoming flight got delayed"". So the new itinerary that was booked for us was: * Hyderabad -> Singapore: Silk Air * 8 hrs lay over in Singapore * Singapore -> Hongkong: Singapore Airlines * 1 hr stop in Hongkong, where we had to deplane and go through security checkin again. Hongkong -> San Francisco: Singapore Airlines * 2 hrs stop in San Francisco where we had to finis our immigration, customs, and then go through the security again. San Francisco -> Seattle: United * Here, due to the incompetency of Silk Air/Singapore Airlines staff, United refused to board us (18 passengers) as the tickets were not be ""endorsed"" correctly, even though our baggage got into transported in to the plane, and they had enough seats for all of us. Finally, some of us got rebooked to a 05:30 flight and some of us to a 06:35 flight in the morning, where most of us spent the night in the Airport.","negative"

No menu was provided for the entire flight and I did not know which champagne or wine I was drinking nor did I know what to expect for dinner or breakfast. Only for the main course (entree) did the cabin crew provide a quick booklet which after choosing was quickly taken away again. After asking cabin crew for a little help to figure out how to convert my seat into bed I was asked if it was my first time with Singapore Airlines (I am Krisflyer Gold). Cabin crew never asked if I wanted to be awaken for breakfast (which I did not). After waking me up and providing me with a cup of coffee I waited 50 minutes for breakfast to be served. Again no menu. A rather disappointing service.","negative"

I have called around 7 times to Singapore Airlines and 4 times to Virgin Australia but no budy help me. They have changed the date and timings also of my flight. I have very urgent work so I have asked to give me the flight accordingly so I can reach on time, they have flights and seats but they asking for extra money I said it's not my mistake but they said you have to pay. I have asked ok give me the flight from Perth to Singapore at 1:10 AM apart from 6:40AM they didn't give me this also, lastly I have asked ok book my seat numbers because I m travelling with kids, they said contact to Virgin Australia I said I already contacted them they said contact to Singapore Airlines.

"535","Did Not Even Try to Help My Pregnant Wife Took a midnight flight from Singapore to Sydney with my pregnant wife. During the flight, the man in front of us was very aggressive for some reason and kept on reclining his chair and rocking it to annoy my wife who was sitting behind him. As my wife preferred an aisle seat, we asked if they flight attendants could speak to the man or switch my wife's seat with someone. They attendants said that because the man was so aggressive, there was nothing they could do. So I gave my wife the middle seat instead and which made her feel claustrophobic. I asked the attendants again if they could switch her seat but because it was a fully booked flight, there was nothing that they could do. I am quite disappointed with Singapore Air because we had heard such great reviews about their service. I also contacted Singapore Air directly via phone, email and web form - all of which have been ignored.","negative"

Last time we were realy mad and told the staff to get some food from business class. They did. We are only talking about the eggs. It appeared to be exactly the same as economyclass.

"96","Impossible to talk to a human, website booking can’t be complicated but still the best in the Pacific I have been flying Singapore Airlines for 42 years. There is no question that it is not the airline it once was. However, on this route it is still far far better than any other option. Service is far better as is the food, etc than United. My last business flight with United was shocking. Service was non existant and food on the long flight was just sad. As one passenger said who had slept through a meal - “Do you just have kids food for snacks?”. Cathay Pacific was a form of torture with tight seats and flight boarding that is total mayhem. SIA is trying and still the best. I would warn you that having traveled with them after two surgeries in the past the wheel chair service in Changi is abysmal and the United Polaris clubs are nicer. SIA is also particularly hard to get a status match - even for United 1K or Million Milers. They also have a website that rejects a lot of itineraries meaning you have to book separately. Where they REALLY are TERRIBL is communication as it is nearly impossible to get a human. The chat feature proved useless for me recently, even after he forwarded an itinerary that an agent said was impossible. Very frustrating! At least United has good Milage Plus service and no PIN is needed to contact them. However, I JUST booked a flight with SIA and know I will have several more in the next year. They are the best over the Pacific if you don’t mind the nightmare of their website and customer service.","positive"

"4353","Slight let down I’ve travelled with Singapore airlines previously and it was great, with flight and service. Unfortunately this time their standard has dropped, not in service but quality of meals. You would think I’d be served with Singapore cuisine but instead served with Turkish food. Wasn’t good food. I was also slightly concerned with the landing as it was slightly rougher than normal considering weather conditions were ideal. I’m hoping it was a one off situation but overall it’s a good airline.","positive"

The delightful flight attendants greeted us with smiles and offers to help, and made sure we go to our seats (way in the back). The entertainment on the tv screen on the back of the seat in front of us was very extensive and had many choices of things we enjoyed seeing. The dinner and breakfast we were served were outstanding. Even my wife, who is very picky about food, raved about how good the meals were. The choice of beverages (especially the wines) were excellent and we felt like we were in a high class restaurant. (again, we were in the lowest class section). The hot towels before and after meals were appreciated. The flight itself was very smooth, on time, and the captains remarks appreciated.

I was at Singapur airline check in desk around 40 minutes today and my check in was still not complete. I asked the check in lady two times ... do we need to hurry up because the flight is soon leaving, right? I did not got any answer from her and trusted she will know. The fact is that 4 ladis where standing behind the desk working on one check in and could not provid proper service so I could board my plain is unbelievable?!?!?! 35 minutes before my plane was leaving they said the boarding is closed. What??? 35 minutes is not enough time to go from the check in to the gate??? Through this inconvenience from Singapor Airlines i missed my connection flights from Jakarta to Singapor, from Singapor to LA, from LA to Mexico City from Mexico City to Huatulco!! 4 flights missed!!! After complaining with singapor airlines management today they booked me the same flight 24 h later but only to LA. I am having additional expenses: accomodation in Jakarta, food, I need to pay another plane ticket from LA onward and I am missing out all my meetings in the following day. A few hours after this inconvenience I found out from my travel agency that my flight was canceled by Singapor Airlines although the plane was actually leaving from Jakarta - just without me. Very weird, right?! I am traveling all my life but such bad check in service, costumer service I never experienced before. First and last time booked with this Airline. Definitely not recommended to use Singapor Airline Service!!!","negative"

Singapore airline staff isn’t consistent, sad to say, which is why I don’t always opt to travel Singapore Airlines.

"1143","Worst Customer Service We booked flights to Thailand for 4th February 2022 for our 5th Year wedding anniversary. We checked all the Covid and travel requirements Turned up to Heathrow Airport 3hours before departure time with all the required documents - only to find out on the 1st of February the Thailand Government reintroduced their Thai Pass scheme (which was previously suspended) the Thai pass needs at least 5 days to process and they advise 7 days before you can follow it up. Therefore if we applied for the Thai pass we would not have it in time. We explained our situation at the check in desk and even showed our attendant the UK government website which states the Thai pass is not required. Our Singapore check in attendant went and showed his manager. I also explained to the manager that we have all the required documents other than the Thai pass as it was impossible to attain the Thai pass in the timeframe we had. The manager then just shrugged his shoulder and said tough luck I’m not going to let you board the flight without it. At which point I said “I understand and I really need a help to find a solution because I’m not sure what I can do.” He replied to me saying “it’s not my problem - you have to leave”. The manager was completely rude and showed no empathy towards our situation. We pleaded at the ticket desk for some help but none was available. The staff at Thai Airways showed more empathy and care to answer our questions and explain the process. We literally had to turn back with all of our baggage and get a cab home. I will never book another flight with Singapore Airlines again and will definitely be sharing more segments of my ordeal online.

His name was Shiva or Shivam, and he was most likely of South Asian descent. He kept making rude gestures to my parents and me, both senior citizens, and after confronting him, he said he had every right to do so. He kept on changing the queue and continuously harrased us. We were tired and exhausted after 10 hour flight from Christchurch which was delayed. As a passenger I have paid the full price of my economy class ticket. We deserve the same amount of respect and courtesy to be extended to us as given to those in first and business class passengers.

"1307","Trip to Australia This is a lovely airline, the stewardesses in their neat uniform cannot do enough for you, and their smiles are so sweet. And the planes are lovely too with enough legroom not to really need spending more to get the ones at the front in Economy class. We flew late 2019 so had a full flight with lovely food and snacks. My wife is semi- disabled and we asked for the full assistance, so when you get to Singapore Airport on stopover on the way out, unless you ask for it, your own wheelchair goes to the next flight with your luggage. This is ok, but, you get taken in one of their wheelchairs to a drop off area inside the vast flat very large terminal which houses all 4 terminals, and dumped. I could have gone to get coffee visit toilet etc, but my wife was stranded for 90 minutes. The nearest shops were 50 yards away, unaccessible to her. The only up side is that when its time to board your next flight you get taken by someone who knows where they're going and when you reach your gate they push through everybody else to get to the front with me following behind going, 'sorry, sorry', to people. the trick is to ask for your wheelchair back at Singapore and it arrives out of the hold in a nice big plastic bag, so you can explore the large terminal and shops to your hearts content, there is even a smoking room 'inside' near the butterfly area-which is very hot!","positive"

Never would I ever have imagined that I would be able to see them while traveling. I cried. She even sent me the photos she took. The captain had alerted her that they were visable. We were the only ones awake. I cannot thank Alyssa enough. I’ve been chasing them all over the globe. Great crew and I can’t recommend them more. Oh and she gave me 4 pages of what to do while we are in Singapore. Thanks you so much for all of your amazing service and genuine care and excitement.

I remember when it was first introduced around 10 years ago but it has never made sense. Crew have to set it up and undo it, it's hard and not long enough for someone of 195cm. I see that SQ are replacing it progressively with the more conventional format. This flight includes a very old plane which is quite worn so it may be one of the last to update alas. But crew service helped to make up. So caring.","positive"
"8975","Singapore Flight To Perth with no window on window seat. We were so disappointed with our seating as we booked a window seat. When we boarded our flight our window seat didn't have a window. It was the worse 5 hour flight of my life. I felt very like the whole plane kept closing in on me. I would never have picked a window seat if I had known this. They should have something telling you there is no window on their website letting people know this seat has no window although it is classed as a window seat. Thank goodness we had lovely people in front of us that did not put their seat back. Don't pick seat 57J and 57 k on flight SQ215.","negative"

"11213","Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Milan via Singapore. When Economy class is completely full, it's too cramped and uncomfortable. With long waits for food, drinks and the toilets, I found the flights to be very long and tiring. Having said that, I'm sure this applies to most carriers. The food however, was very nice and the extra snacks are a nice touch. Service was friendly and professional and there's a good choice of movies. Planes on all four flights seemed a little aged.","positive"
"11317","Flew on redemption tickets SQ First Singapore to Seoul and Business back from Seoul. I was very disappointed with the first class. The last time I did First was to New York about 4+ years ago on the ageing 747 that was far better an experience. Pre-flight details were excellent using the Private Dining in T3 Changi. However the food on board was terrible. My wife ordered the Japanese Kaiseki and it was not good. My Wagyu Sirloin was leather tough.However Dom Perignon 2004 did help to wash it down. Fortunately the flight back form Seoul on Business was excellent with good food. I think SQ need to re-look at their inflight food standard outbound from SIN.","positive"
"232","SIA differing customer care SIA has Customer Service Plan that states its commitment to providing airline passenger protection covering assurance of providing lowest fare through that booking channel, prompt refunds and a 24hr free cancellation, etc. All these should be basic and standard BUT THEY ONLY APPLY TO FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF US! What about a similar customer service plan for flights in and out of Singapore to ensure that its Singapore passengers are treated just as fairly? Other airlines have the same 24hr cancellation policy for all flights not just only those in and out of US which is transparent and fair!","negative"

Flew on the return leg and was really satisfied with the overall flight experience as well.","positive"
"1060","This airlines scams customers Beware, this airlines scams their customers: The airline refuses to refund my ticket. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fullfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen. If you think of buying tickets from this airlines please don't, because they clearly do not care about their customers and basically scam them of their money.","negative"

The premium economy is worth the extra money. the only minor point is the quality of the food and the frequency of meals and snacks offered. It is still good but I have the impression that SGP Airlines is on some cost saving here. Please keep your high standards and do not lower them following the competition's trend as this is for us the reason why we always will choose Singapore Airlines above the others.","positive"
"6360","The non-stop between Newark and Singapore was an expensive personal disappointment! I can't believe that I spent so much of my own money (over US$7000 RT) for the convenience of a non-stop that was so uncomfortable that I didn't get a moment's sleep (in either direction). Nor could I sit comfortably! In my opinion, the seat design is weird and requires one to twist one's body in order to sleep flat or even sit. I noticed that the leg support only supported 3/4 of the seat so one leg was essentially unsupported -- when it worked. And on my flight between SIN and EWR the leg support malfunctioned and wouldn't stay elevated. There was only one other seat to move to in that section of business class so I guess the seat issues don't seem to bother other passengers. But honestly, I would have been happier paying for United Polaris service with a stop than to be subject to these seats for so many hours!!! For the sake of full disclosure, there are a handful of seats in Business Class where it is possible to sit and lie with a straight spine. Even though I asked for one of these and they were available at the time I booked back in August, SIA said they were reserved for mothers traveling with infants. Well, in reality, on my flights these seats were occupied by businessmen who must have had greater clout than me! I was not very happy.... SIA are reputed to have the best service in the air and that was fine. But this was business class and NOT first class and I thought that this was nothing special.... The meals were ok and not great. The western dishes were almost accompanied by bland carrots and green beans which were too al dente for me to chew. I was slightly happier with the Asian meals. Further, the cabin crew made no effort on either flight to ask whether non-sleeping passengers would like any of the snack options. Nor did I see the packaged ones on a tray where people could help themselves... But what really got me is that there were no amenities to speak of on the way back to EWR whereas there was a kit on the flight to Singapore. I asked for some lip balm and was told that there wasn't any on board. I protested saying that I was given some on the flight between EWR and SIN (although I had to ask for some because it wasn't in the kit). It blew me away when I was informed that lip balm is a First Class item and we were, after all, only in Business Class. I consider that to not be a luxury on a 17 hour flight!!! And then I was informed that the kits were only being handed out in the first 90 days of service but, in fact, my outbound flight had been 3 1/2 months after the initiation of this service.... To the credit of the crew serving my area of the cabin, they appreciated how miserable I was and offered a very small service recovery gesture. It was a kind gesture and probably all they could do inflight but it was woefully inadequate considering the value of my airfare. I'm sure there are enough business people whose companies are willing to pay for the non-stop service but for me this was a SABENA (for those old enough to remember: Such A Bad Experience Never Again)!!!","neutral"
"1849","Great service We had multiple flights booked with Singapore Airlines. I had never flown with Singapore Airlines before, I was told by so many people how fantastic the airline and it is advertised as the best airline in the world! So maybe I already had too high expectations of the airline and I found them no better than other airlines I have been with in the past. Flights were a reasonable price and the service of the staff was second to none, nothing was too much trouble, the food was very average and on the plane you actually seemed very squashed in your seat more so than other airlines. It is very expensive to upgrade your seats too in comparison to other airlines. We tried to upgrade in the bid and told unsuccessful but yet half the premium economy seats were left empty. I would fly with Singapore again it was not a bad experience at all but not the excellence I was expecting over and above other airlines. I found it just the same as Quantas, Virgin, British Airways, Thomson flights I have been on and not as good as Emirates.","positive"
"10449","Copenhagen to Denpasar via Singapore. I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll. Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since ""it was not in the menu card"" I was told. Very strange. On the return flight to Copenhagen the entertainment was slightly better but the food and beverage was far below the standard you get elsewhere like Qatar Airlines. The experience with Singapore Airlines was the biggest disappointment I have had since very long.","negative"

Also take the option that SQ offers Bus class flyers in choosing your meals in advance of the flight. Beware tho you may have changed your mind when you get on board!! Not because of the food just your personal preferences. Staff are attentive but not intrusive and always helpful IMHO. The A380 upstairs has no central overhead lockers so it gives a spacy airy fell to the cabin. Great way to fly!","positive"

Experiencing SQ by myself really showed me that your airline is even in Eco a class better than others. The crew is extremely friendly, smiling and helpful. Even in the final hours of a stressful 12 hour flight. There is enough food and drinks. Also the crew was not tight on giving alcoholic drinks (this is what you want in vacation haha). Also a full and delicious meal on a 2 hour flight from/to DPS is just awesome compared to European carriers.Regarding cleanliness, I have never seen a cleaner long haul plane than this. The crew cleaned the restrooms all the time and refilled papers. Also, the crew kept an eye on cleanliness of the galley and aisle and removed papers or whatever trash was on the floor. I have not seen this before. The IFE is basically perfect. The selection of movie, TV shows and music outstanding, also the program is up to date and the touch screen is very responsive. Last but not least, the A380 is an awesome aircraft from a passengers perspective and offer the ultimate comfort for modern day longhaul trips. I will definitely choose SQ again rather than other carriers.","positive"
"8886","Premium economy fantastic! The cost of Premium Economy is more than justified once you settle into the larger seat, better foot space, lift up leg rest and ease back the armchair with more arm room also. The only downside for me was they are leather, hence slippery, seats. Otherwise, service, comfort and even Singapore Airlines way of boarding by group, and enforcing it, made our trip fantastic.","positive"
"1963","Bad service My recent flight with Singapore Airlines didn't have a happy ending. I didn't get my luggage at my final destination. I receive my suitcases three days later. I have to do some shopping because my stuff was in my checked bags. Moreover, I receive an email 24 hours before departure that I can check-in online. And when I want to check-in, it wasn't possible to choose a regular seat without surcharge. I ended up going to the airport and check-in there. The flight was conducted by SN Brussels and transfer to Singapore Airlines in Milan Malpensa Airport, Italy. Another worst scenario I've experienced, while we're already waited on the specific gate in Milan airport, 20 minutes before the boarding time, they suddenly announced that the gate number has changed. Furthermore, no headsets available onboard - I usually take my own, but I haven't thought about it. I end up watching movies without sound. Singapore used to be one of the top airlines several years ago; somehow, they're not the same anymore. Very disappointing!","negative"

The gate was opened 50 minutes prior to boarding. Boarding was smooth, on what seemed to be a full flight. Seat, and adjacent stowage bin were perfect. Bin could comfortably hold my Rimowa Attaché, but not Business Class. Took off on time, flew a different route than the incoming flight. Flew asleep, Cabin Crew gently tapped me on the shoulder, to eat. Have had ANA, and EVA let me sleep, and tag my seat returning later. Meal was good, Mushrooms had lots of flavor. Two-three rounds of drinks included. Recommenced sleep, and woke up. Cabin crew appeared taking drink orders, and brought back snacks. Crew continuously smiled, were warm, and professional, throughout the flight. They continued to check in, and ensure I didn’t go empty. Second meal served, again with endless drink rounds. IFE was not up to par, with what I’ve previously experienced on Singapore Airlines. Landed at EWR on time, with my bag quickly appearing. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"6833","Par Excellence - As Usual We've traveled Singapore Airlines almost exclusively on our long haul flights out of Australia for the past 5 years - and for good reason. Where Qantas and Cathay Pacific seem to have fallen from grace, Emirates and Etihad have stepped up but they are yet to prove their consistency. And that's the secret to Singapore Airline's success - consistency!

This makes for happy crew, happy passengers and an enjoyable trip.","positive"

"6558","Great personal service in modern suites The suites are great on Singapore Airlines, especially the updated ones on the new A380s. There is plenty of space and some of the suites can be combined when there are two travelling. The food is very good and there is loads of it. You can also eat in the private lounges before boarding or when in transit. The new planes carry up to six passengers in the suites (down from twelve in the older planes). There are two huge toilets on the new A380s and i'm pretty sure the most passengers we had on one was five, so there were no queues to use one. There are no showers on the planes, but showers are available in the lounges. Later this year we will be flying Singapore Airlines again. The first leg in an old suite and the 2nd leg we'll be trying out a 777, so just first class. It will be interesting to compare the two cabin configurations.","positive"

"4335","A long, noisy flight This flight between flight between Singapore and Copenhagen did not begin well. It was originally scheduled to depart from Changi Airport’s Terminal 3. About 2 hours prior to departure, the electronic departures board indicated a change of departure gate to a gate located in Terminal 1. Consequently, we had to make our way from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1 onboard the “skytrain”. The aircraft for this flight turned out to be one of Singapore Airlines’ older Boeing 777-300s (9V-SWF). These aircraft are due to be replaced on this route by Airbus A350s later this year. It will not be before time! Despite the fact that we were travelling in the retro-fitted Premium Economy cabin, the aircraft was certainly displaying the ravages of time. Our seats were between the window and the aisle at the rear of the Premium Economy cabin. This meant that we were over the wing adjacent to the starboard engine. Despite the fact that we were issued with Premium Economy noise cancelling headphones, the noise from the jet engine was almost over-powering and was prevalent throughout the almost 13 hour flight. We had availed ourselves of the “Book the Cook” service which is available to both Business Class and Premium Economy passengers. Unfortunately, the meals were nothing more than average in quality. As this flight departed Singapore at 11.50pm and arrived in Copenhagen at approximately 7.00am, there appeared to be an expectation that passengers would sleep most of the way. Consequently the lights were dimmed for most of the flight and services were limited to two meal services and the occasional rounds of water or orange juice offered overnight. Premium Economy certainly provided a less cramped experience on this flight when compared to the Economy cabin. However, the age of the aircraft and its noisy jet engines meant that it was still far from and enjoyable and relaxing flight!","neutral"

"3998","Our Flight Experience When we booked we had middle row window side seats, or back row middle section seats as our choice. Took window side. 24 seats all up. The good stuff. Priority check in. Ample baggage allowance which includes priority stickers, so bags usually come through more quickly. Priority boarding after Business Class. First served for drinks and meals. Menu has a starter, choice of 3 mains and a dessert, plus cheese and crackers. Limited wine choice of 1 white (Sav Blanc)and 1 red (Cab Sav), though it does include champagne. Food choices are pretty much the same as economy. Generally we enjoyed the food, but chicken salad starter had chicken so overcooked it couldn't be cut let alone eaten. The not so good. We had 2 lots of 2 x 10 hr flights and the firm seats were getting rather uncomfortable by the end of all flights. No toilet specifically for Premium Economy passengers, just use the economy ones with everyone else. Seats slightly wider with each row being 2 x 4 x 2. Seats do recline a little more than economy, but when the person in front of you reclines their seat and you are dinning, you can still end up with your wine being knocked over and food pushed on to the floor. Person in the aisle seats still has to get out to let the person beside them get out. Only the front row has more leg room. There is a box (possibly the entertainment box) that sits under all the aisle seats which limits foot room. Good variety of movies and other entertainment to chose from. We take our own noise cancelling headphones, so can't comment on the headphones provided by the airline. The crew are lovely and very helpful and the safety video is beautiful. Is it worth the extra cost for Premium Economy, possibly, but next time we will go Premium Economy on Air NZ, it's far better.","positive"

"7937","Singapore London and return After six years of my last London trip i managed to squeeze a little time of ten days to be there again. Well as usual it was on SIA again. I was happy to take the retrofitted 777 again. There was only four seats in this cabin thus assured me of more privacy. There was only two toilets which meant that i only share the toilet with one other person. Actually i love this retrofitted seat 1F rather than the normal sky suite which SQ is famous for. It was less claustrophobic and gave a nice sense of openness yet gave sufficient privacy. I was happy that even though it was a red eye flight the supper service of five good courses inclusive of that delicate caviar served on a light cauliflower mousse was excellent. The seat which can be converted to a real flat bed of 35 in by 81 in with a comfortable linen duvet really lulled me for a good six hour sleep then. As usual the crews were excellent and they anticipated my needs well. they knew my favourite drinks of a good chilled flute of a third apple and two third Perrier with two ice cubes well and my usual Kenyan coffee well. It was a pleasant flight. I as usual seldom watch any movies but the selections of classical repertoire on board was wide. I managed to read a good book during this flight.

Our original flight booking was from IAD> LAX, Los Angles with Alaskan Air(5 hours), then LAX> NRT, Tokyo with Singapore Air(10 1/2 HOURS), with our luggage checked through from IAD to NRT. 2 seats cost $1,202. Because of my recent surgery, we decided to bid $300 to upgrade to Premium Economy being notified 48 hours before the flight that we won, providing 2 inside seats on a 2-4-2 seating configuration). This gave us more seat width(as Economy had a 3-3-3 configuration, which included a double armrest solving the inevitable encroachment of an oversize passenger. Today my neighbor was a 75 year old born in Arkansas internment camp for Japanese in 1943, who returned to Japan to teach English before retiring. Premium Economy includes gourmet meal choices for lunch and dinner(if selected online before boarding), complementary wine/champagne, and even Ben and Jerry's Cookie Dough ice cream. The beautifully dressed stewardesses twice provided hot towels, and multiple drink and snack selections throughout the flight. At other times the room was darkened for sleeping where many passengers utilized the noise cancelling head phones to utilize the large seat monitors for its huge selection of movies, TV, games and music. We walked back the 2 aisles to share the ample economy restrooms stocked with mouthwash, hand lotion and toothbrushes and toothpaste.

"10224","The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom).","neutral"
"6810","A great airline to fly with but the business class bed lets them down. Having had a connection from Madrid we arrived early into terminal two and the Singapore desks were not open but the desks in front were open and we were advised to use these as they could do exactly the same as the Singapore desks and we therefore saved about three hours waiting around for the gates to open, a good tip for anyone. The lounge at Heathrow was a huge disappointment staff were more concerned about gossiping with each other than doing their jobs. Dirty plates were left on our table for an hour, the bar was often left unattended and when I went to use the showers I was shown initially into two showers that had dirty towels strewn on the floor. Checkin was quick and the welcome on board was friendly. The seat when in the seating position was the best I have flown on in business class but when converted into a bed was just too hard to get much sleep, hence the four not the five point rating. A mattress topper would have made the whole journey more enjoyable. I am 1m85cm tall and had no problem with the cubby hole space for your feet in sleep mode and this had been a concern prior to the flight. The meal service was excellent my steak from the book the cook menu was cooked to perfection for me and my partners duck was equally good. Drinks were topped up when needed and water was offered throughout the flight. Arrival in Changi was efficiency at its best. If the bed issue can be sorted out Singapore airways will become my go to airline.","positive"
"10350","Prior to flying I had a nightmare trying to rearrange my flight when quarantine rules changed. Emails were not replied to and the UK telephone line required a pin to proceed. The change I required was not possible online. I purchased an aisle seat but I was not allocated one when they changed my booking. The flight was very disappointing. We took off about 12.30pm. After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought. I was quite disgruntled so attempted to get a refund on the seats I had purchased and voice my complaints. Yet again I have found it impossible to contact them.","negative"
"26","Awful I don't expect a great deal of comfort when flying economy and in this regard the flight met my expectations. The seat was extremely uncomfortable and cramped. I am a small person and even so the seat and leg room did not afford any comfort. I was allocated a seat amongst families with three infants, which was unfair to me and the families. Service was very poor. The cabin crew were not interested in passengers and systems were disorganized. My husband was skipped at breakfast time ... simply ignored. He thought they must be serving the other row only and going to come back to him. He had to request breakfast in the end. It was difficult to get water. I booked through star alliance network which made managing the Singapore Airlines part of my journey, with seat select etc difficult. I will not fly Singapore Airlines again.","negative"
"4582","Meet expectation The boarding procedure was well organised and hence there is no bottle-necked jam. I felt there are enough cabin crew on hand to assist the passengers, hence the smooth boarding. Well, the food are acceptable. The more experienced cabin crew are able to engage the passengers and do pay attention to the passengers' needs. I only find one younger crew member that seems a little stress and she just ""shoved"" the food and ice-cream to the passengers (It was a full flight), not like the more experienced ones who seems to offer rather than just put it down for the passengers. I believe with a little more time, the particular cabin crew should be able better herself. One more thing, the safety video is very innovative and engaging. Overall, I have an enjoyable flight.","positive"

"4128","Singapore Airlines After all these years Singapore Airlines maintains it's position and well deserved reputation of ""The Airline other airlines talk about"". Excellent and courteous staff, fantastic meals and in flight entertainment made the time from Sydney to London with a 2 hour break in Singapore easy and comfortable travelling. We travelled with a child and the inflight movie and entertainment selection kept him occupied on both flights. The break at the delightful Changi airport gave us a chance to stretch our legs and grab a quick meal then board the flight to London where the cabin was dimmed so everyone could get some rest before arrival. I will definitely be flying with them again and their service is second to none for all aspects of flying. Highly recommended.","positive"
"7071","Great entertainment system, great seats (economy) Flew SQ361 and SQ362 Stockholm - Singapore - Stockholm with the Airbus Industrie A350-900. I was sitting in economy but I had reserved a seat with extra leg room as I am 6 foot 3 (193 cm). However, space was fairly good even in the ordinary seats. Entertainment system was great, large clear touch screen with over 90 english spoken movies, lots of other stuff to watch. Kids enjoyed all the video games controlled by the wire remote that is located in the seat. USB charging available. Headrest is moveable. Food was good for being airplane food, mostly asian dishes. Only down side with this fligth was the stop in Moscow where everyone including hand luggage had to leave the aircraft and pass through security. Felt like an unneccesary stop as not many new people left or entered the airplane. Stop was fairly fast, estimation 60-90 minutes. Overall, I will fly Singapore again when I am travelling to far east asia.","positive"

"2862","Only average I usually take emirates when I fly. but decided to take Singapore airlines for once to try it out with all the great reviews. I felt that the inflight entertainment was quite limiting and difficult to navigate only a small selection of new films compared to loads of old and new alike on emirates. But I would say that I enjoyed having a full HD display. I would say that the crew were above average in the terms of service and gave a hot towel before the flight which was a bit too warm for me. The food was way to salty and had only a western and Chinese options without any curry option as I guess they assume that only people whom order a halal meal like curry. For some reason they would not let me charge my phone during take off and landing. I feel that this airline is not worth the extra money over emirates. I feel some of the good reviews of this airline are from Singaporeans whom pledge loyalty to the national airline without trying out the competition","neutral"
"3947","Would not fly with this carrier again Was recommended to fly with airline but never again. There was no leg room, inflight entertainment was appalling and the meal service terrible.

On a good note the air stewards did have a lovely disposition.","negative"
"6441","First flight was the best We had 4 flights in total, and the first flight was the best, mainly due to the food being served which was to our taste. On the other flights the food had mainly Asian tendencies which were not to our taste. The staff were very good on all flights, and particularly good on our first flight when there was a family in front of us who were constantly calling the staff. Lots of choice of films etc. We were disappointed that on our flight home leaving Christchurch at midday we had to pull the blinds down to enable people to sleep, when we would have liked to look out of the window.","positive"

Although still better than Swiss Airlines, we were dissappointed by this A380 flight. Staff friendlyness was just average (in deed we saw only one flight attendend smiling, all others made a bored impression). Food was ok, but also not outstanding. Sleeping possibility was nearly impossible. As an avarage 1.8m European, I could only lay on my left side in the position like a croissant because the space for legs and feed is beside the seat in front of you. Hipps and shoulder hurts very fast in this stare ""sleeping"" position. Emirates is by far better, because their seats are able to lay flat and straight.","neutral"

The flight - best, makes economy feels like first class! The cabin noise is simply sweet lullaby for a baby. Very stable plane despite slight turbulence - was there even one? The in-flight feature is awesome, from USB charging ports to touch screen entertainment as boasted in their advertisement. Like the lightning - simply makes you feel safe and soothed to the max! Fly none other, if not, frequent this flight! Makes the flight the travel itself in the airplane. The food tastes one up, with the portion just right for each meal time. The destination doesn’t matter, is the flight that counts! Comfortable legroom and good seating with comfortable ambiance temperature. There is endless entertainment to choose from, including watching the flight path - keeping you updated on the flight telemetry. Great piloting ensured that the most important part of the journey - arriving safely at the destination! Good work captain and crew! The next choice for flight will be this airline again!

"9833","Singapore airways We have flown Singapore Air before and always found them to be excellent but we are very disappointed by the new airbus provision for economy travelers. The seats are extremely uncomfortable if you are flying long-haul. There is much less leg room and the seat upholstery is just not very good any more. Our short haul flight from Denpasar, Bali to Singapore was great in one of the ‘old style’ planes but Singapore to London was a different story. Flying out in daytime wasn’t so bad but coming back at night trying to get some sleep was difficult. Also just extricating yourself to use the toilet when the seats are reclined is very awkward. We will be looking to see if other airlines are better before choosing Singapore Air again. The on board service remains very good indeed what a shame that economy travellers’ comfort has been compromised to serve the better off.","positive"

All aspects were fast efficient friendly and professional. Economy seats on the 777 are far better than any other airline I have flown IFE was very good with a wide selection all flights on time and onboard staff very good. Quite simply I can see why they are always rated so highly.","positive"

"1266","No quibble refund after we booked direct with airline I have seen so many bad reviews on major airlines as a result of COVID flight cancellations. I can only say that I have nothing but good things to say about Singapore Airlines from our own experience. We spoke with one of their representatives on the phone after they rang us and she was as pleasant and helpful as anyone we have ever spoken too. She processed the return of our ticket costs after they had cancelled 2 of the flights without any fuss whatsoever. We were told that the refunds could take from 2 to 6 weeks before they would be in our bank account, 4 days later we had the full amount refunded. When all this horrible situation is sorted there will only be one airline we will use to make our trip to see the daughter and grandchildren. Good service earns its own rewards.","positive"

They will happily and quickly take your money but good luck ever getting it back if you are owed a refund. I have been given the run around for 8 months now. Call center is absolutely useless with no power. Refund department does not reply to emails for months. You can't talk to a real person in refunds. They don't write down your information in the call center, calls aren't logged with you information. I have provided them my contact details on 5 occasions and when i call, every time they say there are no contact details on file. Basically a fraudulent company using customers as a bank.

Jetstar could really do with taking a few pointers from this carrier. The seats are comfortable and the service is excellent. Previous experience with SilkAir was travelling to Singapore then connecting to Dublin on Emirates and they checked our baggage right through to Dublin from Darwin. The airfares were also really good value costing less for my husband and I to fly to Tokyo than for one of us to fly to Perth. We used seat guru to select our seats. We were a bit hot on the flight over to Tokyo but on the flight back we selected seats with only two seats in front of the midsection toilets. We could recline our seats without impacting anyone else, there was plenty of leg room for my husband who is quite tall and the traffic really wasn’t that big an issue.

"10089","Singapore Airlines quality has declined significantly over the years. I used to fly regularly but stopped taking it for a while until yesterday on a long haul flight from Houston. Food and beverage - Just above average. Beef bourguignon was overcooked and not tender. Chicken Tikka lacks flavor. Poor wine selection. Only one that was really good was the singaporean crab cake. Premium economy lacks leg room vs others. Pillow case is old and faded in color. Some parts of seat sides not cleaned properly. Entertainment Behind vs others. Live TV doesn’t work. Lacks in brightness and sharpness. Lack of TV series options. Worst, it was down the whole 24 hrs flight during my wife and kids travel on June 18th. They gave compensation vouchers but only for inflight shopping which lacks necessary / useful items. Wifi onboard while it’s free it lacks the speed. Amenities did not get any. Not even eye mask, tooth brush. Cabin crew no longer the proud “singapore hospitality” it once was. Some friendly and attentive, some others just wanting to get the flight over and go home. One even mistook connecting headphone to headphone jack as phone charging so she forced me to take it off during landing and when she realize she was wrong did not say sorry. During my flight from Houston on July 5th I suddenly received notice that baggage is transferred to another flight. While it’s good they notified early and they delivered to my holiday accommodation, had to wait for 8 hours without clothing and basic necessities and ended up doing last minute shopping. They acted as if it’s a normal situation. No compensation. Punctuality I have to say they still excel in this area (hence the two star). It seems likely that SQ has exercised significant budget cuts post covid to increase profitability. However, price is still high vs others so it’s time to take a reflection.","negative"

Normally I never finished my meal on board I just took a couple of bites and that’s it but not this year 🥰 it was all so good.

"6736","Great airline, beautiful airport, pathetic service. Flying to Singapore on Singapore Airlines is something people dream of. We took the flight and loved it, the airport was amazing but when it comes to security and immigration, it appalling. The airline is great, economy seats are good, pitch is perfect and a guy like me 185cm sits pretty comfortable and I did enjoy the flight. The greeting by immigration was like ""why the hell did you just arrive at midnight, I'd better be in bed"". Well, the flight was scheduled to arrive 0010. Sorry guys. Three days later we left to Hanoi, again, the security were nasty and bored, hated every moment of their job. Then on our way back with transit in Singapore Changi. Straight after landing, we disembarked to find a massive amount of passengers in front of us in a Que, wondering whats happening, we finally saw from distance what's the issue, its security checking passengers just as when boarding!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. We just landed and came out of a plane, what possibly could we have bought or manufactured on board a A330 of Singapore airlines? I travel like 6 to 12 times a year on international and domestic flights. Never ever was I required to go through security after landing, just to go again through security at the departure gate (the same terminal). We were delayed like at least 45 minutes till they cleared the 3 A330s and a 777-200 that just landed, I asked why is this check? The officer replied just a random security check! That resulted in loosing our time to go to the duty free and enjoy the airport facilities. Had to run to our gate so we won't miss our flight home. But the airline is definitely A1. The waste of time of passengers in the name of security will cost the Airport it's reputation and the duty free loosing customers like us, we were looking forward to buy few things but our time was consumed by useless unnecessary checks.","positive"
"2787","Disappointing experience on Los Angeles --> Singapore --> Delhi Flight I have flown multiple times (using a multitude of airlines) from the US to other destinations around the world. Although quirky, my airline of choice has been Turkish (due to their in flight service, entertainment and the food, which I find above average). I had to make a trip from Los Angeles to Delhi (India) and decided to check out Singapore Airlines as I had heard so much about their food and entertainment. The flying time on this sector is extremely long as the flight (SQ 11) makes a stop at Narita in Tokyo for an hour, before proceeding to Singapore. Let me just say that I was really disappointed - the food was among the worst I have eaten in economy. Bland pasta and hard fish soaked in an unappetizing sauce - really bad! The dessert was just an ice-cream. In contrast Turkish Airline's food in economy is just fantastic. Great kebabs, chicken, excellent warm rolls, tasty dessert... and the ticket costs less (while the travel time is shorter by many hours). The only saving grace was that I had pre-ordered a Hindu Non-Veg meal on one of the sectors and it was delicious. So I guess the trick is to pre-order a meal if flying via Singapore Airlines. The entertainment was lacking too - most of the 'new releases' were old and tired movies and the selection was very limited. Even Turkish Airlines offers a wide selection of movies (and they really do have 'new releases'). The FAs were great and polite - so no issues on that front. It was odd that they never offered an amenity kit to passengers (which Turkish offers to all). In conclusion, I am glad I tried it once, but would never fly with Singapore Airlines again. I am not sure how people find this airline to be good (and how has it won so many awards) - the only thing I can think of is that people haven't flown with some of the other airlines. And am now dreading the long return trip back to the US (23 hours flying time) with them in a few weeks. Maybe I will just pay for the extra-legroom seat and pre-order my meals.","negative"

"2797","Disappointing business class The lounge in Changi was chaotic and packed out, we had to climb over people and luggage at the entry and it was hard to find a seat when we did it was cramped in with a family of 4 and only one of us could get a snack in fear of losing our spot. Champagne selection was excellent though. Boarding was prompt and easy. The service on board was good, the flight attendants were professional, however being a red eye we felt like we missed out on some perks of flying business. It was midnight by the time we took off and they didn’t have a chocolate or any snacks whatsoever to have before we went to sleep, only nuts on offer. Breakfast was abysmal and on the verge of inedible so we didn’t get to have an impressive in flight dining experience. The seat/bed was hard, pillow very small and for an 8 hour flight, we just expected more. We had a better experience on Silk Air tbh and wish we had of chosen a different carrier to fly with in business for over $6000.","neutral"

Overall Singapore Airlines is a great airline to fly with and the experience leaves you wanting for more.","positive"

"6600","Great service but.... We flew from Adelaide to Rome, Paris to Adelaide and felt that the service was great. For some reason, Singapore Airlines don't have Premium Economy on the Adelaide-Singapore (and return) leg of our journey so that remains a disappointment. The Premium Economy legs were so much more comfortable and have spoilt us for travelling Economy for the long hauls, if we can ever afford the extra expense again. The food, drinks and service were great, as in a previous trip, but the IT side of the airline really needs some serious work as we had a ridiculous amount of trouble with the website time and again. So much so, that both times we've travelled to Europe we had to spend ages on the phone while we were overseas trying to sort out an issue. We really enjoyed the service and personnel, but both times we travelled the website was painful and resulted in phone calls instead. The difficulty we've experienced with the website for checking in, securing seats, payments etc, would be the only thing that would cause us to look at another carrier.","positive"
"5158","Despicable behaviour to loyal customers Are you considering Krisflyer as a Star Alliance loyalty programme? Forget it! As a Krisflyer gold member for the past few years I haven't redeemed many flights through Singapore Airlines because they make the process so complicated and tedious. Since they are gradually introducing other Star Alliance airlines to their online redemption searches - about 10 years behind other leading airlines - I decided to book a reward flight on SAS from Copenhagen to Oslo. The flight cost 12,000 miles plus US$25. But, since I can no longer travel during this period, I gave advanced notice and attempted to cancel the booking online. Over one week later I get an SMS saying that I need to call them, only to discover that I must pay a US$75 fee to cancel the flight. The only explanation is that it was in the terms and conditions. I have a Oneworld Emerald and Skyteam account with other airlines, and neither of the airlines through which I have redeemed flights in the past charge such ridiculous and unexplained fees. In fact, the entire process is automated and refunds are processed promptly, sometimes immediately. How Singapore Airlines seeks to penalise loyal members for its own outdated practices and systems is unreal. It's a complete disgrace. A single attempt to cancel a reward flight that ends up costing you 30 minutes on the phone to Singapore and US$75. That's loyalty punished right there! I plan to draw down my Krisflyer account and cease flying them altogether. I'll look into a better Star Alliance airline programme and suggest you do the same. Dreadful customer service both in flight and on the ground. Fed up of it. No more!","negative"

Crew are happy to make your seat into bed upon request. Food is very good. We normally book the cook. Wife was very impressed with lamb curry etc. Another quality about the crew is that they address you with your name. My sons, his wife, my grand daughter of 3 years, plus us two are flying to Singapore and Bangkok in business class. So you see we will happily ecomend SQ to anyone","positive"

My husband was due to fly from Phnom Pneh to LA this weekwhere I would meet him and we would then travel on to Mexico, but because of the ineptitude and attitudes of ground staff at PP this has not happened. We have been in constant contact with the airline since then requesting a refund - they refused him a boarding pass, saying because he travels on a UK passport then he is not allowed entry into the US. This is totally wrong, he only cannot travel to US if he has been in UK in the last 14 days (remember, he's been in Cambodia for the last 7 months). Yesterday I got that in writing from the US embassy in PP. I won't got into the attitude given - that's for another time and place. Back to the refund - they either want to charge us a cancellation fee, or we have to wait until they 'conduct a full investigation' before they will 'consider' issuing a full refund. This is not acceptable treatment from a 5 star airline, and far from what we would expect from Singapore Air","negative"

This leg was DPS (Bali) to CNX (Chiang Mai). Excellent service and comfort on A330 and B737. Excellent air crews and attentive service. Slightly disappointed with the Silver Lounge in Changi Airport T-2, with it's dark interior, but it's a minor gripe as we always enjoy the lounges especially as compared to other airlines/alliances.

They are polite and attentive. Just one hiccup was check in at Delhi airport. There was a quite a long queue, suddenly a staff member, stopped us where we were in the queue and told us we could go to another check in point to ease the congestion. Of course we were at the front and all the people behind us hurriedly marched along and got there in front of us! Hmmm,, disadvantaged, seeing as we were up the front originally. Then a woman in front of us was with her two young sons, held us all up for up to 40 minutes as she decided to upgrade to business while checking in. We were furious and called the manager, she wasn’t too apologetic about it. Only explained the reason, which we guessed anyway.","positive"

"10806","San Francisco to Singapore. My wife and I were planning a vacation to SE Asia, so I bought round-trip tickets between San Francisco and Singapore on the Singapore Airlines web site. The next day I was looking for tickets to Siem Reap for a side trip to Angkor Wat when I discovered on Travelocity that Silk Air had the best flights, and that Silk Air was a part of Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines website did not make this clear at all. So I called Singapore Airlines to add these Silk Air flights to my booking. Imagine my surprise and disbelief when I was told I had to pay a $500 penalty because this ‘change’ came two hours after their 24 hour change deadline. I talked to two of their supervisors, but they also insisted on this penalty. It did not matter that Silk Air was hidden deep within Singapore Airlines website. It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour ‘deadline’ Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty. Just booking the Silk Air flights separately would have cost me an extra $690. In a situation that clearly called for a little flexibility and compromise Singapore Airlines showed none. For that reason they have earned my lowest rating.","negative"

However, I recently flew their segment with a technical stop in Canberra and I was confused why they needed to have all the passengers leave the plane just to set down or pick up more passengers.

"7312","Experience wasn't nearly as good as the reviews. This airline consistently rates as one of the best in the world, but this route seems to be a red headed stepchild because there wasn't much to cheer about. --The food was fairly poor by Business standards. (better artisan breads would have saved a mediocre take-off meal) --The furniture is outdated and needs a re-do. The cabin's lie-flat beds seemed like they were from the first generation of true lie flats. You have to manually turn the back down and the average person would have a hard time putting it back up. I saw flight attendants put their full body weight on the bed to release the lock. They were actually pretty good for sleeping, but there was no opening for leg room directly in front of you to stretch your legs while sitting upright. You have to turn cock-eyed diagonal in your seat to put your feet up and twist forward to face the tv screen. --Check-in and customer service is very good and I could see here how they really shine in other ""more important"" locations. The business class lounge in Changi airport is really, really good. Really. It should be the standard for most of the other big airline lounges. Hope they fix it.","neutral"

Check in was quick and polite checking my PCR result for entry to Bali security was quick and the Singapore Airlines lounge at Heathrow was okay. Boarding was more or less on time the seat as normal on SQ comfortable for the 12 hours flight. The crew where all pretty nice although I sensed perhaps not the normal expected on SQ, the food service was just okay good enough but again not really SQ standard that said the flight was fine. Arrival in Singapore on time I headed to the lounge to wait my connecting flight which was packed with little seating although I managed a shower. SIN-DPS was on the newer 787-10 which I really enjoyed nice crew food okay.

"4842","Consistently good It has been a number of years since I last flew Singapore and the standard is still there. On a A380 so it was quiet as you would expect. The key elements of the flights were: 1. Staff were friendly and helpful 2. Seats were comfortable and a good size - slightly larger with more leg space. 3. Food was enjoyable and catered for both Asians and western. 4. Beverage - the wine list left a bit to be desired, they could improve here. Others such as Bloody Mary's etc were good. 5. Movies - there was an extensive list to chose from, however I felt they could have been better with a few more up to-date one. Also the TV shows were limited. 6. Comfort and safety - cabin was good temperature and the flight was good plus on time. Overall I was happy with the service of Singapore and will fly again with them.","positive"
"9653","Only just OK flight We have flown with Singapore Airlines several times and in the past I have been happy with the service. However this flight was not as good as the past. The newer aircraft have squeezed in more seats which makes the economy section just plain uncomfortable for the long flight. Also the seating is designed for six foot males and I am an average sized female and my feet could not touch the floor if sitting up straight in my seat. Not sure how the shorter Asian customers manage. There was a ""footrest"" in the back of the seat in front of me, but my feet couldn't even reach it. Not much point having it really. Over it wasn't too bad and the time between flights from Melbourne to Singapore, then the second flight to DaNang was about two hours, but on the way home - 7HRS IN SINGAPORE!!! Just too long so well be wary of that next time. There are free city trips for long stopovers, but we were just too late to make one of them. We were able to watch a free movie while waiting and someone told us there was a swimming pool available somewhere in one of the terminals. The quality of the food has definitely gone downhill. My food was just OK. Not what I have come to expect from past experiences. The staff were fine, no complaints, but the edge has gone off the friendly there too I feel.","positive"

Cabin staff service are great and treated everyone with polite manner and respect. Most of the people on the flight seem to be enjoying themselves, no one seem to be cranky (which usually the case on a flight) or in a hurry to get off.

"10878","Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. AMS to SIN was in premium economy on an A350. The SIN to BNE sector was in standard economy on a Boeing 777. At this stage, Singapore Airlines doesn't offer premium economy to Brisbane. These two experiences were extremely different. In Premium, I paid a little extra to sit in the front row. I was able to extend my legs fully and adopt different seating positions. It was relatively comfortable. IFE was excellent. The large screen, extensive selection and quality headphones made the flight pleasant. Food was nice and the cabin crew were really professional. Changing in Singapore to standard economy - the seat was obviously narrower and my knees touched the seat in front. I could only adopt one sardine like position in my seat. All in all, it was quite uncomfortable for me. The food and service were efficient. The tiny screen was hard to see, having to often adjust the angle and on the 777, the selection was less than on the A350. In my opinion, there is a very distinct difference between standard and premium economy and I think the extra cost if well worth it.","positive"

I remember being very impressed with the amenities then. So when I worked for a different company, the default airline became PAL mostly, and for personal flights I’d choose CebuPac. So a couple of months ago, I had a biz trip to Malaysia and I was tasked to book for my own flight. so I booked SQ. Sadly, it wasn’t that impressive anymore- from the flight crews, the cabine ambiance, the amenities, they are just comparable to any other economy flights now. In the flight back, the plane was just half full! Many passengers had the row only to themselves! The verdict- the airfare of SQ (which is more expensive than most airlines) is not worth it for me (to think that the company even paid for this trip!).","neutral"

"1168","non-existent customer service We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not China Air cramped, but certainly not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. Their customer service was non-existent. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agent's line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days! We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed, seemingly permanently. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones. When we returned we found that all they would refund were the taxes. Sent a letter by post to the corporate headquarters.

Even during the busiest periods, every move by each staff member is as graceful and warm as the Singapore summer. Cabin comfort is quite standard, as well as the entertainment and culinary options, though the service is a true benchmark to industry standards.","positive"
"6157","Expected better with their reputation All our research told us what a fantastic airline this was, so, maybe my expectations were “ too high” . As we were premium economy, we were encourage to “ Book The Cook”. These dishes were supposed to have been tried, tested and adapted for “ tastebuds in the Sky”. I honestly could not taste the difference between this food and other dishes we had been served in Premium Econy on other airlines. Quite a few customers in premium economy suffered Seat malfunctions, ie, seat would not recline and footrest would not retract back under the seat. Have to say, the aircrew lived up to their reputtation, even if we did have to ask for a second glass of wine rather than being offered - again, as in other airlines in premium economy. Have also have to point out that the seatbelts on this aircraft were THE most uncomfortable belts I have ever experienced. They were very large, heavy and cumbersome. Seriously suggest these be reconsidered.","neutral"
"5192","Easy, comfort, good service A350 seat is not optimum for premium economy A380 or 777-300 much better as leg room is unhindered. Boarding, Service, food, drinks, room all good- hard to go back to economy class.","positive"
"2891","Five star flying Once again, we chose Singapore Airlines to fly us to Italy via a stopover in Singapore itself. We flew Premium Economy for the extra room (I am 192 cms tall) and comfort of their better seats for the combined 20 hour journey. Once again, we couldn't fault the quality of the aircraft, the cabin crew and the in-flight service. They are certainly one of the best airlines in the world, in our opinion, without being any more expensive than other airlines on the same route. We wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines!","positive"
"169","Never Again Received a bottle of water at the start of the 16hr flight, and finally had to walk to the back of the plane to ask for another bottle of water, this after about 7 hrs. Food? One meal at the start of the flight, and as i sit here writing this 11 hrs into the flight, no more food, i.e. meals or snacks. Oh, no stewardesses either. I get better service on a 1 hr flight on southwest!","negative"
"11531","SGN-SIN-SYD on 9th January 2014. First leg on B770-200. Excellent and proactive ambitious and diligent staff whether old or young. Seats not lie flat but no need for a two hours ride. Lounge access food and drinks very good. 3-4 options for hot food given! The Bollinger champagne is now replaced. No cheese table could be offered. No wifi available. SIN-SYD on A380-800. The cabins provide some privacy. Beds are flat but not fully horizontal a small angle of 3-4% remains disturb sleeping and annoys. The TV screens are heavily light reflecting and are more mirrors than TVs – what a disaster as compared to the investment. The tray tables are in a funny skew position forcing the gourmand to lean sideways while eating. Disappointed by this seat furthermore its hard to operate. Food is excellent and options are plenty. No cheese table offered. No wifi available. FAs were kind caring and attentive. SQ is the only airline serving stout beer - quite charming. Wines are good and food is good as well.","positive"
"4935","Inflight service seems different The usual inflight meal service as expected from SQ. But it seems that now that do not serve the hot drink (Coffee / tea) separately from the main meal. It everything together, It used to be after the main meal is served and packed, they will go another round to ask if you needed hot beverages. Also this flight no not offer ice cream tub, what I had was just a pudding. Nevertheless, the inflight food for SQ is still nicer compare to other airlines.","positive"
"10795","Another great flight from Singapore to London. Me and my wife were sat in the upper economy deck which was great!

"749","Expectations Exceeded My wife and I recently resumed our regular trips from the USA to the Philippines post pandemic. We decided to try Singapore airlines and flew aboard the famous SQ21 flight Newark to Singapore just shy of 19 hours, touted as the world's longest regularly scheduled flight! As an aviation buff I was stoked to experience this long flight, having flown 16.5 hours I figured what's a couple more hours. First of all, there is no economy class on these flights. It's a premium economy and in price comparable to what the competition is charging for economy. That being said, the seats were so much more comfortable, larger, more room, exceptional leg room and the premium economy cabin is in a 2X4X2 configuration. Traveling as a couple my wife and I enjoyed a two seat row to ourselves, which was awesome not having to disturb a stranger to get up mid flight to use the lavatory or stretch your legs. If you travel solo they offer phenomenal single seats that come with extra inflight storage. There is an additional nominal fee for these seats if I'm not mistaken but well worth the money for a long flight like this if you're traveling alone. The food was very good for airline food. You have two options, choose from the inflight menu or log in to the website preflight and choose the ""book the cook"" option which not only gives you a choice of gourmet meals but you'll get your meal first! So take advantage of this if you fly with Singapore airlines. The Singapore airlines cabin crews are second to none! The service was exceptional, they are so well trained, so friendly, attentive and professional, we can't say enough good about them! The Aircraft itself was an Airbus A350-900 in the ULR configuration. "" Ultra Long Range"". It was a beautiful airplane inside and out. I was an aviation buff was able to appreciate the design and sound and feel of it's very powerful and reliable engines. I was very very pleased with the whole experience. This was just one of 6 flights we recently flew to and from the Philippines from Newark NJ/NY 4 of which were with Singapore airlines. I've flown aboard their competition and I can tell you Singapore airlines is the best in my opinion for long haul service US to Asia. We will be flying with them again next year for sure without question. Thank you again Singapore Airlines for the great and memorable flights we really enjoyed them! ✈️","positive"
"10366","The airline refuses to refund my ticket for May 2022. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen.","negative"

They deal with both the passengers and their follow crew with courtesy and with the attitude of willingness to serve.","positive"
"4395","Excellent Have just written a review for the Heathrow Singapore leg as I was not impressed . However to be fair this leg was excellent . Clean, modern everything worked .

"10455","Bangkok to Singapore was the biggest let down. Okay food but they ran out of certain dishes during the first service run. Service on this flight was understandably rushed due to its 2-hours duration. But it was also terrible. I ordered post-meal drink and notes were taken but they forgot about me. I requested the drink again, but was told too late the bar is closed. We pay premium for business class partly to enjoy the amenities including F&B. Running out of certain dishes and forgetting to serve a drink renders this as a wasted expense and for that we currently do not recommend this airline.","negative"

Seats were in 1-2-1 configuration with aisle access to every passenger in business class. The food, as expected, was amazing; keeping in mind that we are in a pressurised cabin 30,000ft up in the air and our taste buds go nuts. Seats were comfortable; better than the 2007 business class version. Lots of thoughtful storage spaces. Managed to get 5 hours of sleep in the flat ""bed"".","positive"
"7161","A good airline with great service I actually booked my ticket through Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) but the whole trip was operated by Singapore Airlines. This carrier comes with a very high reputation and it is deserved. The cabin staff go out of their way to make the journey pleasant. The planes are well maintained and cleaned and the seating is excellent. The beds require a fairly simple action of folding the seat back down and rolling out the bedding. This gives a better bed than the fully reclining seat. My schedule meant that i had a journey of breakfasts. More thought could be given to those passengers, like myself, who were making an almost 24 hour trip. We arrived in Brisbane at 7.30pm. I had eaten nothing since the breakfast i received 6 hours earlier. Better food service would have gained the fifth star.","positive"
"10240","This was a very bad experience, as the service quality of Singapore Airlines has noticeably declined. I couldn't understand why the flight was delayed for 40 minutes due to late passengers. While Singapore Airlines uses environmentally friendly cutlery on its short-haul flights the quantity of food served has been reduced. The unbearable thing for me was that I am a Gold member of Star Alliance, but on arrival to Denpasar I had to wait for 50 minutes for the priority baggage of this flight. The plane arrived at the gate at 21:07, but it was already 22:00 when I got my luggage. Finally, although the entertainment system interface was very nice, there were not many good movies and music options for me.","negative"
"8117","Fabulous Every Time Flying can be a very uncomfortable experience but Singapore airlines have changed all that. Their attention to detail, service, comfort and dining experience was exceptional. This long haul flight is a killer usually but travelling Singapore Airlines, and yes I am lucky to be able to afford to fly first class, is like being in heaven. I don't want to sleep the in flight entertainment and service is just so good ! Caviar, Dom Perignon Champagne, (or would you rather Krug) is flowing followed by fine dining all the way. When I finally sleep my bed is made up and the size and comfort of this flat bed experience is so comfortable I'm asleep before I know it. The sleep attire is comfortable and cosy as well as smart and the bathroom although not as big as some airlines ( you could improve on this Singapore Arlines) are clean and have plenty of Lux toiletries. I'm traveling again next week back to London and cant wait to do it all again ! Highly recommend this delightful spoil with this fabulous Airline.","positive"
"10599","The Melbourne to Wellington flight is an early morning flight, arriving in Wellington in the afternoon just in time for most hotel check-ins. The short-haul international flight serves one round of meals with 4 options for mains available. I went for the cheese omelette and it was great. Cabin service was exceptional as usual. However, the aircraft itself is very dated, especially the seats. The seats are in a 2-2-2 configuration, and it's not the best Singapore Airlines Business Class seats. It's okay for the short-haul flight, as they turn into flat-angled beds. There's lots of leg space and decent width. In-flight entertainment technology was dated, but the content is good in terms of library and variety. All in all, it's definitely the best Melbourne-Wellington offering (when compared to narrow-bodied aircrafts of Qantas, Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand), but it's not the best SQ offering.","positive"
"4245","Super Flight Excellent flight, very polite friendly stewardesses - paid for extra legroom, which was great - food was good the service very attentive, lots of overhead room, and the 13 hour flight passed away so quickly - boarding & disembarking went without a hitch just smoothly & well oiled - what a difference efficiency makes - very pleasnt journey - highly recommended","positive"
"10102","Singapore Airlines never fails to deliver on its excellent inflight service. On this 16 hour flight, I booked the cook for the two meals - baked lobster for the first meal and chicken briyani for the second. Both meals were really delicious . The movie selection was extensive. I watched the latest Mission Impossible movie on board after the first meal. I managed to sleep for a continuous period of 6 hours before waking up for the second meal. Free wifi was available throughout the flight and was of decent speed. Cabin crew were very helpful and helped to convert the seat to bed mode for sleeping. A special shout-out to LS Jim for his personal care and service.","positive"
"11534","MEL-SIN Business in December. I was surprisingly disappointed on this trip aboard their 777-300ER aircraft. Granted the newer Business class was not yet installed but overall I wasn't all that impressed with the quality of the seat which looked rather tired. The lounge in Melbourne is barely comparable to a domestic Virgin Australia lounge since they have split it into Business/First and had a very poor food and beverage offering. Despite requesting not to be woken for breakfast service during the flight to maximise sleep I was. Not a picky traveler and not a regular Business traveler either but found myself a little disappointed at the offering considering the hype.","negative"
"7180","Never again Damaged baggage, Singapore Airlines refused to acknowledge the damage along with there local handler Menzies. Tried leaving messages but there mail box was full. Sent emails, response was to call if no answer then leave message. After multiple email exchanges was advised they will refer to head office. Head office responded with a flat decline and refused to acknowledge the attempts made at contacting them. More than the damage to the luggage the experience of trying to justify to incompetent staff at Menzies and staff at Head Office who don't understand plain requests in English is better left unsaid. When it comes to professionalism and handling customers concerns Singapore Airlines STINKS. NEVER AGAIN. Buy a cheap ticket a crappy experience is expected but with SA it gets a lot worse especially post travel.","negative"
"9048","Perth to London flight Apart from having extra legroom and the seats being roomier, the food was no different to what one would have received in Economy class. As I have severe allergies to certain foods, my agent noted this on the booking (and I saw her duly note these allergies)., Unfortunately Singapore Airlines said they had received no mention of this and anyway they could not deal with specific allergies which I find very hard to believe. ((Fortunately I do carry an EpiPen with me at all times, but I always hope thatI will not have to use it!)","positive"

"10442","Los Angeles to Colombo via Singapore business class. Left on Jan 27 2020 from LAX and returned Feb 21 2020. At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called 'book the cook' which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX. Sorry Singapore airlines you are no longer the top 'dog' in the business. I will think twice before going with you again.","negative"
"7656","Best Airline I have travelled with major airlines but Singapore Airline has always been my favourite. For the courteous service and pretty much on-time departure and arrival.

"5440","Very Disappointed Flight from Perth to Singapore was comfortable even though I am tall, Singapore to Vietnam,(HCMC) was comfortable, HCMC back to Singapore also okay, but the flight from Singapore to Perth was absolutely dreadful. The plane must of been the oldest in their fleet, felt like I was sandwiched between two people, I had a problem reaching down to get my glasses out of my bag and I am not overweight by any means. I was very disappointed with the airline considering its high rating. If and when I ever fly with them again I will be finding out which plane I will be flying on. I was sent a survey but I wish they had of sent me one for the flight from Singapore to Perth","neutral"
"9314","A little Disappointed I have alway quite liked Singapoer Airlines so was looking forward to our trip to Europe. The first leg of the trip (Akl - Sin) was in fact code share with Air New Zealand on one of their 787-900 aircraft. This sector was great with Air NZ performing to their normal high standards. Sadly the net leg on Singapore itself was less than acceptable. Premiunm economy on this aircraft was frankly poor. The seatiing was below par for this class of service and the food was very poor. The flight crew were not at all friendly and the service slow . I thought this may have just been a one of but when we returned (6 weeks later) the service, food and comfort was virtually identical. I do not recommend the Premium Economy product from this airline. Its not worth the money.","neutral"
"692","Not what it used it used to be...shame shame Singapore used to be one of the best but has been going more and more down. Tickets are sold a fortune but the food and service are only going down. Luggages upon arrival wasn't there, got it next day, ok can happen, but I have learnt since then that Singapore airlines has actually been bumping luggages every day for a while and passengers each and every day are missing their luggage upon arrival (same thing happened on the same flight to a friend of me 3 weeks later and other 20 passengers, my flight we were about 15 not to have it) This is not acceptable at all Food who used to be good is very average to not good at all now..... I couldn't even eat breakfast last time as it was really bad. And when you want to change ticket, they are trying to force you to pay the highest rate and the rates are insane. I don't like to travel with them anymore...it's really a pity. Speaking to other passengers from other destinations and they told me also they this airline has been going way down and they do not wish to travel anymore with them. See the only thing they want is to make money on the back of the customers..... Get a hold of yourself Singapore Airlines....we are not money machine","negative"

Delicious food and a lot of options are available to suit families dietary requirements. Good hospitality and the Info/Entertainment system keeps updating every other year I travel in this airline which is a plus. Fresh fruits and other snacks/drinks are available upon requests anytime during the flight, which is very convenient. As we fly long hours of 10 hours and more, we get served two big meals. In-between the meals the movies/music would keep the travelers entertained and won't feel bored. Headphone jackets do not need a converter which is an added advantage. Some flights do come with USB outlets for charging devices and Wifi for an extra fee.","positive"
"4016","Business Class Singapore to Perth Booked a J Class flight back from Singapore to Perth using United Airlines MileagePlus points. Didn't need to check in as had done it at Penang. Spent a few hours at The Jewel after especially coming back through Immigration. Went through to the BC Lounge and had a snack. Lounge was quite comfortable although somewhat crowded. As the flight was to Australia, final security was at the Departure Gate which gave me a bit of a scare as the Duty Free Lady was late (probably because the gate was changed). She arrived just as final boarding calls were being made. Flight to Perth was uneventful and reasonably enjoyable. Unfortunately the A330 had one of the old seating arrangements and was not a true lie flat but angled so that you continually feel as if you are sliding down to your feet. At times I found I got better comfort by propping my feet up against the back of the shell of the seat in front (being a shell it is independent of the seat so you don't annoy the passenger in front). About time that SQ finished their upgrade of the seats or retired the aircraft. It certainly isn't up to scratch and detracts from the reputation of the airline for quality.","positive"
"4112","Excellent once again I have been lucky to fly with Singapore airlines on several occasions. I have also flown with other big name airlines to similar destinations and quite simply Singapore is easily the best. This flight 13 hours from the UK to Singapore was unfortunately delayed about 3 hours. We were given a £15 voucher to spend in the departure lounge during our delay. Not great I know but last year we’re suffered the same fate with a different big name airline but received nothing. The flight itself was as always great. Good food, snacks in between, and good service from the cabin crew. The toilets must have been regular restocked and cleaned as they were of a high standard throughout the long flight. The Economy seats are good with a decent amount of room with plenty of pillows and blankets provided. The entertainment system in the seat back in front of you is good with a large selection of films, tv shows, games and music. The only negative I have is that I am still waiting to hear from Singapore airlines about my claim for compensation around the delay as I missed my connection meaning I was significantly delayed to my final destination. Under the EU laws this claim should be straight forward but Singapore seem to be dragging their feet a little. Regardless of this issue I would always travel on Singapore if possible.","positive"
"8409","Singapore Airlines A 380 Business Class from Singapore to Sydney From Check in at Changi Airport to Kris Flyer lounge to boarding the aircraft was seamless. My wife had walking disabilities and nothing was too much trouble for the ground staff and also the on board staff. After a meal the cabin crew showed my wife all the features of the Lie Flat bed, TV controls and kept checking on her health all night. Then at 5-00am in the morning for our 48th wedding anniversary a special cake and Teddy Bears for us. On arrival in Sydney the cabin crew ensured my wife was able to get from the aircraft to the wheel chair and right through immigration and customs!

"359","Flight from Dublin to Brisbane The first leg of our code sharing flight from Dublin was cancelled at the last minute to Frankfurt. Got an email short time later from Singapore Airlines saying we were booked on an Emirates that night. Retrieved our luggage from another terminal and waited at Emirates counter for over 3 hours until their counter closed as Emirates said they never received authorization for our alternative flight tickets. Told to go to Swissport in Dublin who were great and arranged a hotel for the night. After getting to the airport hotel at 11-00pm we rang our travel agent back home shortly after who said she had to converse with Singapore Airlines for over 2 hours to arrange alternative flights. Finally got another flight home later the next day which went off without any problems albeit a day later. Our previous experience with Singapore Airlines has been great but this flight was incredibly stressful and we had a feeling of abandonment in Dublin due to a lack of communication from Singapore Airlines. Hopefully just a one off experience.","negative"

The food was better then any I have had on a plane and the service was great. They gave us an eye shade, socks, tooth brush and great service for the entire flight. Returning from Singapore to San Fran was a totally different experience. Food was not eatable, no mask or socks, when they served the trays stayed for a very long time and you could not move. Seats were ok, but seemed to be better on the outgoing trip. The air craft was different on the way over. Nothing better then our normal flights on Delta.","neutral"

"10678","Last time I flew with Singapore Airlines two years ago I was really impressed so I was excited to travel with them again. We boarded in sections efficiently and were warmly welcomed on board. The seats are smaller and the pitch tighter. We departed on time and as soon as airborne the teen in front of me reclined her seat the screen was a hands length away from my face. Shame that this more expensive airline has effectively negated the positives of flying with them. Yes you still get hot refresher towels and the entertainment choice was pretty good. The food was okay, nothing special but adequate if you like beef. We were seat 45, and the only option left was the beef. The toilets were kept clean and we arrived into Changi on time. However it is the tight seats at premium price I have an issue with. I am divided as to whether I’d recommend, it’s safe and reliable so I’d say yes. However do not expect anything special.","neutral"
"7490","Read this first before booking Singapore hotel package by Singapore Airline or Changi airport SIA operates a great airline, but they don't do hotel packages very well. We recently book a Singapore Stopover tour on the Changi website. SIA is a partner of Changi and put together this package which include a hotel, SIM card, transportation to a hotel and breakfast a a fast food outlet, Ya Kun. Getting each of these was like pulling a tooth. Information desk at Changi airport had no information when we arrived. UOB bank was charged with dispensing SIM which they ran out of. The hotel asked for a voucher which was not in the email. And Ya Kun at the location on the voucher had no idea what the deal was and refused to honor it.

"8904","Not worth paying extra for those seats with extra legroom June, 26th; seat number 47H. Extra payment after I booked already another seat. Not worth spending the extra money. Those seats with extra legroom are very close to the lavatories. and very close to the seats of the staff. You will be constantly disturbed. No need to stay that SQ-airlines are among the better airlines I have flown with during 50 years if traveling. But save your money for something else, don't pay for those seats!","positive"

"7371","No standard food Is not 1st time taking SG, their food standard dropped really bad, even bread also hard & cold. This time lucky only 4hrs, dont eat also doesnt matter. Last flight from SG-NY 20+hrs didn't eat. Now you know why people taking long haul need to eat instant noodles. Although I did call for instant noodles, but can SG try to improve the in flight meal standard. Economy also need to pay extra, next time maybe taking budget better. At least don't bother can sleep through whole journey","neutral"
"4035","Sadly disappointed We have flown Singapore Airlines before and been very happy with the service but we were very disappointed with this flight. From Colombo to Singapore we flew with Silk Air (booked Singapore) the plane seemed very old, with no screens, the service was very average and staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful. The flight from Singapore to Melbourne was better but still the staff weren’t the usual helpful friendly staff we are used to. My husband also was quite sick when we got home and we think it was most likely the airline food. We pay a bit more to fly a non budget airlines expecting to get a bit better service and facilities. Very disappointed and I don’t know if I would fly with them again.","neutral"

The stewards and stewardesses are handsome/beautiful to behold with smiley, welcoming faces. Our seats were just by the entrance to the plane and next to a galley. The standard of service was exceptional. Nothing was too much bother and the food was wonderful and plentiful. My only criticism was that my husband was served his special meal ( he is diabetic) first and I was served last of that sides service. Surely it would not be too much to serve a meal to the accompanying passenger at the same time.","positive"
"1225","Ridiculous Customer Service ""Enjoy complimentary rebooking for ALL TICKETS issued up to 31. December 2021"" . This is what Singapore Airlines advertises on their website. Well, it is not true ! When we changed (online not possible! ) our return flights (same flights, only 2 weeks earlier! ) and originally booked online with Singapore Airlines, we were charged extra. Asking why, they explained it with a different booking class..., on a flight to Singapore that was after all only about 10 % occupied, connecting flight from Singapore about 30 % occupied. After extra payment, new tickets were issued with a lower baggage allowance. Had to call them again, but you must know: The customer service is, if at all, almost not reachable by phone. On top of it, one suitcase did not arrive on time with our connecting flight. Overall: Quite unprofessional service and defenitely one way to loose customers for the future. Bye Bye Singapore Airlines.","negative"
"9182","Excellent airline Singapore airlines are probably the best airline in my opinion for service and politeness nothing was any trouble I asked them for more leg room as my wife suffers with cramps in her legs it wasn't a bother to them I witnessed one passenger get angry at them because he had a meeting the plane was delayed due to incoming connection flight being delayed so they had to wait for those passenger they never lost their composure if it were me I would have the man was totally out of order then when we were boarding he refused to get on but they talked calmly to him he eventually got on even while on board they were amazing on passenger kept asking for food every hour and they were greeted with a smile never an issue I highly recommend these top class service","positive"
"399","Disappointing After flying a few times with Singapore Economy Class I decided to splurge and try Business Class, but I was disappointed for one main reason: I remember the slogan for Singapore Airlines used to be, 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', and this is one of the rare cases of 'truth' in advertising and one of the main selling points and points of difference for Singapore airlines. But obviously, this slogan is not very PC or woke, and is no longer used because of those reasons; but that does not mean it isn't true or effective marketing. But worse than that, the Business class cabin was staffed by way too many male flight attendants; and even worse, the 'team leader' for all the flight attendants on all Singapore Airlines fights I have experienced (business and economy) was a man! So, Singapore Airlines have gone from 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', to way too many male flight attendants and not even a Singapore girl or woman being the the boss of the inflight cabin crew! That is extremely stupid and disappointing! For Singapore Airlines to relinquish one of the best and most truthful slogans in airline marketing history because of woke or otherwise pressure is political correctness and 'equal opportunity' gone mad! Isn't it funny that for years women strive for equal opportunity to no avail, but when whining men cry for the same it is instantly realised to the detriment of everybody, including an airline's effective marketing slogan. The vocation of flight attendant is a 'care' vocation, like a tour guide, like child care, like elderly care, men should not do it. I will avoid Singapore Airlines in the future for this very reason: 'Singapore 'Man', you're NOT a great way to fly.","neutral"

"10788","Flew return from Singapore to Taipei. Flights were a very reasonable hour; early morning departing and early afternoon returning. The flight out was probably only 65% occupied, which contributed to the overall sense of wellbeing. Flight was on the A330 series, with 2-4-2 configuration. If travelling as a couple or pair, taking the window/aisle seats definitely gives you a sense of your own space, so this was a big plus. Legroom was reasonable. Service was up to the usual standards, although the most senior crew were sometimes a bit unsmiling. Food was average to good, depending on your choice, and the AVOD although not spanking new, was sufficient to entertain most for this 4 hour flight. The airplane is probably beginning to show it's age - it was a bit creaky and rattly on takeoff and landing, but everything is well maintained and perfectly comfortable. Singapore Air may transition some flights to the Boeing 787, and many suggest the 3-3-3 economy seating is a nightmare for economy travellers.","positive"
"11540","SQ976 to Bangkok from Singapore: okay service on 20 December. SQ981 came back to Singapore from Bangkok: much better service.

Lived up to expectations in terms of service and staff which was great and up there with the other good airlines we have used. Had Airbus A380-800 on the Sydney - Singapore legs and Boeing 777-300ER on the Singapore-London segments. The Airbus is far superior, larger and newer with better legroom for us.

"4254","Food not the greatest We have flown many airlines around the world and was looking forward to revisiting Singapore airlines as they had a new plane now in service from Adelaide. The staff are lovely, there is no fault there. As we were placed down the back (if you didn't pay extra to pick your seat on this already overpriced fare, being school holidays, the back is where you get placed) by the time the food got to us the best choice had already been taken and the only option was a fishy pasta with the most chewy, rubbery prawns I have ever had, which was disgusting. I know airline food is not always the best but for the past 3 years of flying Qatar, Qantas, British Airways, American Airlines and more, this would have to be the worst. My son was ordered a kids meal but was given an adults meal, which we didn't realise and then had to ask for his meal. There is not too much leg room as with most planes, but the seats and entertainment were good. On the flight coming home, it was supposed to leave Singapore at 11:10pm but was slightly delayed leaving. They don't serve you anything, you have to press service to get drinks throughout the flight. About 4:30am in the morning they wake everyone to eat an average meal. The last time we flew with them (13 years ago) we were given a toothbrush, socks etc but nothing but a blanket and pillow this time. If I was going to Europe again, it wouldn't be with Singapore Airlines.","neutral"
"1776","Multi city stop, each leg of the flight great! Flew sydney - tokyo (stopover in changi airport) - hong kong - singapore - sydney with singapore airlines the whole way in business, loved all of it, the staff on each leg of the trip was really helpful, especially on the sydney to singapore and singapore to sydney flights, with the flight attendants assisting with luggage without being requested too, chatting to not just me but other passengers in the cabin asking about their day, talking about the movies they love that are on the inflight entertainment ect. The food was really good, from the starters to desert i ate all of it. The seat was very comfortable even seated upright, the leather was comfy and felt nice to the touch. I had no issues with my baggage, or any of their staff at check in or boarding. Even the safety video for this airline is one of my favourite to watch, as it shows the great sights around singapore. I would love to fly with them again soon.","positive"

Its our first time flying to Singapore Air and it really amazes me because the seats are very clean, wider spaces compared to Cebu pacific and lot of choices for entertainment, as they have monitors and free earplugs (though same with emirates). I am really happy that even Avengers Infinity war is already there. We flew August 2018, and movies and songs are updated. Food are exquisite, really like the red wine and white wine ( to help me sleep). What I don't like is the connecting flight wherein we need to flew first in Silk Air. The space is too narrow, I felt sorry for the couples with babies because only few babies have there bassinets, though its only 3hrs flight, still they need to work on there spaces. But in general, Singapore made us very comfortable and would look forward to book there again.","positive"

"5877","Not good for travel to Singapore and beyond from New York City Years ago Singapore Air had a direct flight from Newark/New York to Singapore. It was great! But they stopped that fight when they got rid of those planes. Now if you fly from New York to Singapore, you have to deplane in Frankfort, wait, and then get back on the plane AFTER going through German customs! A real pain. Last time flew I was flagged for drugs on the way home to New York. I am a photographer and had lots of equipment with me. They tore me apart, opening and emptying every bag of photo and computer stuff, making me remove every piece of equipment I had - only to realize that my sleeping pills were showing up as drugs. They were beyond nasty... And Singapore Air's Frequent Flyer department is terrible. I wanted to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business. I was told to transfer the miles and it would be done closer to my trip.The part of my trip from Bangkok to Singapore and back was upgraded, but the Singapore/New York portion was not. When I got to Bangkok from Laos and tried to do the upgrade, I was told that it had to be done in Singapore. When I got to Singapore, I was told that it had to be done in Bangkok and they wouldn't do it.There were plenty of seats available in Business. I lost 40,000 miles because they wouldn't accommodate me! I haven't flown them since. I used to fly them on a regular basis.They lost a good customer! P.S. I traveled before 2018, but had to put a date on this review.","negative"
"11197","Singapore to Dubai, and overall, Singapore Airlines lived up to expectations. Hot refreshing towels served followed by some drinks and then our meal. Was slightly disappointed with the meal, it looks unappetizing. Also, was slightly disgusted that the cup holder was stained and the stains were easily removed when I scratched it away with the towel. The compartments around my seats were pretty dirty, namely the earphone compartments, cup holder and magazine holder. I believe this does not reflect on all Singapore Airlines aircraft. Service was very good. We had socks and eye-mask for the flight. Toilets were equipped with mouthwash, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and cups to ease washing up in tight space. Cabin crew were polite and presented themselves very well. As a Singaporean, I am very proud of our national airline.","positive"
"10993","Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor - Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit. The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy.","negative"

Had all the hype Singapore Airlines using new planes but were surprised to get onboard, be offered no drink, only hot towels, and then lights were turned off very quickly. First time have experienced this happening. Normally get on board. Offered a drink(s) and a meal. I was travelling with 9 members of family, and it was lucky they were not relying on a meal. Are Singapore Airlines cutting back? Forgot to say my grandaughter is a vegetarian and was not amused with the breakfast she was handed. Have flown with Singapore Airlines many times, but will not be in a rush to do so again.","neutral"

"358","DIFFICULT TO CHANGE FLIGHT DATE BY PHONE We had a booking for 06 sept to fly to Paris and return to Melbourne from Rome. We needed to change the first leg Melbourne to Paris via Singapore date which you can only do via their call centre. It took approx 1.50 hours to change the date. The first person couldn't understand what we wanted so after 1 hour trying to get it sorted we hung up and called back again - different person who grasped what we wanted and sorted it out for us. The first girl wouldn't transfer us to anyone else and said there was no supervisor we could speak to - very poor service and I'd think twice about booking through Singapore airlines again - changes are just far too difficult.","negative"
"8088","Cabin crew attitude My wife and me travelled from Auckland to Singapore on Singapore Airlines ( SQ 0286 ). on 5th November 2018.It was a very pleasant flight even in economy class with the cabin crew attentive and friendly and service the promise of Singapore Airlines. We returned after our Asia tour ( Singapore/Bangkok/Seam Ream Cambodia/Ho Chi Min City ( Saigon ) on Singapore Airlines (SQ0285) also in economy class. Our seat numbers were 61F and 61G which were at the rear of the aircraft.There was nothing wrong with the seats and were quite comfortable. However the cabin crew for this section of the aircraft left a lot to be desired.Either this cabin crew were new or they were just not carrying out their duties with the high standards of Singapore Airlines.The aircraft was delayed on the runway because another aircraft had broken down in front of ours and we couldn't take off.There was cold air blowing on my wife's head and I stood up in front of my chair to see if I could shut off the flow of cold air.This male cabin crew sitting in his crew seat in front called loudly"" Sir please sit down"". I can understand him doing his duty but we were stationary for many minutes.I immediately sat down. A short time later a passenger stood up and started removing something from his hand luggage fro the overhead locker. Nothing was said to him. At both supper and breakfast which were both unappetising I had to make a special request for salt and pepper. Is Singapore Airlines cutting cost on this basic items? Overall the service was poor and substandard not with what Singapore Airlines prides itself.","positive"

Plenty of leg room, great in flight entertainment, Cannot recommend enough compared to all other airlines flown in the last ten years. On return trip, we experienced a delay in Beijing which meant we missed our flight on home to Brisbane. Flight made up for it with plenty of wine and beer, and on arrival in Singapore at midnight, the airline called us up by name and put is up in Changi Airport Crowne Plaza Hotel in a hotel for 7 hours all paid for (with breakfast though we missed it). Very very impressed.","positive"

"3932","You get what you pay for. I haven't reviewed Singapore Airlines in a while. I recently went on a business class flight to Tokyo and back from Singapore. The flight was almost 7 hours long. The cost of the flight is not cheap in comparison to other airlines but SQ offers much more. Their seat size is huge compared to other airlines business class. This trip I found that SQ has removed all their novelty gifts for business class and first passengers. I actually enjoyed receiving a little gift from them even though its probably already paid for in the cost of your ticket but it was nice to receive a perfume or something or rather. They have just removed that element completely. My husband who is a frequent flyer says they removed it a while ago. I also found service was just average. The staff on the airline I went on on both ways did their job as much as was required from them. I didn't get the extra conversations, the small talk that I used to get on their airline. When I entered the plane, the staff who I passed greeted me and I went to my seat. After that I only saw staff members if it was time to serve a drink or dinner. I remember a time when a staff or two will strike a short conversation with you making you feel a lot more welcome. Maybe it was just my luck, but I felt you can take service to a whole new level with a bit of conversation.","positive"
"3525","Sheer disappointment We have flown with SingaporeAir many times over the years. They have always been a pleasure to fly with, until now. Firstly the Changi airport experience is very good. Other airports could learn a lot from them. Boarding is easy. My first complaint is that they have removed footrests?? On a long flight they are necessary, and because they were there on last flight I didn’t take my portable one. This was a full flight in the a380. In March this exact same flight was a pleasure, the reason we paid the SIA, price. So why the changes? Lights out for most of the flight? Only two meals in 141/2 hours! Food nigh on inedible. No pre meal drink. Crew little in evidence. Regret to say true “cattle class”. We had superior service and meals on the Silk Air flight to Phuket, shades of how Singapore Air used to be. All very disappointing.","neutral"
"3475","Hanoi to Singapore on SQ187 This was the return leg of our family trip to Hanoi in July. Totally full flight. Operated on an A330. Mediocre food on this flight segment.

"3263","Reasons why Singapore Air is #1 Trip started on a bad note with a vehicle incident on the way to airport . Airline very accommodating and rebooked for following day and waived change fee. Flight from EWR is SQ's longest so it's almost impossible to say one is happy spending 18 hours in PE. Over the years I have probably flown several million miles and this was one of best flights on any domestic or international carrier. First, chose PE over business class for price only. Could not justify additional $3,000+ price difference at time of booking. Food was adequate even though I lost my pre-flight menu selections due to rebooking. With 2 full meals and availability of snacks throughout flight, you will not be hungry. Movie selection was not very impressive. Good music selections. The recline feature on seats is great. If passenger in front fully reclines, they do not end up in your lap. Last...the crew was fantastic. Pleasant, professional and totally accommodating. Couldn't ask for better crew interaction. Definitely the #1 airline for a reason.","positive"
"10103","Flew from SIN to MNL on Business class and the experience I had with Singapore airlines was an overall pleasant one. Check in staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The SilverKris Lounge at T3 was phenomenal with amazing wide selection of food, relaxing ambience and the one thing I love most is the private nap room. I took a shower which they had facilities in the lounge. The T2 SilverKris lounge looked dated and the food presentation could have been better. The overall ambience, furniture and interior of T2 SKL felt that it did not fit the branding of Singapore airlines and it just felt crowded and not luxurious or relaxing at all. Flying back to Singapore I took SQ business class while my parents were in economy. I was very disappointed because since two weeks prior to the flight I was not able to select seats for my parents who wanted to sit as far up in the forward zone so that I can assist them asap when needed. I even tried reaching out to Singapore airlines but to no avail and I felt like they had little to no empathy in understanding the situation. At one point while using the live chat on the SQ app, the representative was sarcastic which made me feel so disgusted. I also understand that Singapore airlines also does allow us to do online check in up to 48hrs prior to departure time but for some reason they were already allocated seats even before the check in time. The SQ app nor the website didn’t allow us to purchase seats for them and this was very disappointing. Nevertheless, the staff at Manila airport T3 were very friendly too and the SilverKris Lounge at Manila could also have a better range of food selection. Majority of the food there were just quick bites and I felt there should have been rice made available at least. The whole boarding process for my flight SQ919 seemed pretty messy with no staff managing the crowd properly as well in which I don’t entirely blame SQ but blame the airport management for it. Overall the onboard experiences were good and catering was not too bad as well. I just don’t wish for anyone to experience what my parents and I experience when it came to selecting / pre purchasing seats prior to the flight, it was truly not great experience but an inconvenience we will never forget.","positive"
"6670","Enjoyable Night Flight We flew the night flight at 22.05 to Singapore then onto Adelaide....which I would really recommend if you all want to pass a few hours by sleeping...after about an hour we were served a meal..my husband had a veggie meal and I was surprised he ate it as he is so very fussy. The lights dimmed and we all settled down..me hubby and 14 year old...I bet we slept 5 hours. I wore a simple black eye mask and I really think I made a difference...we had cushions and blankets and were quite alright to say it was a economy. On waking we all just started watching the movies again and this passes time. The crew are friendly and are passing thru with water and juice. I did go up to the galley and they greeted mw lovely and offered me goodies...crisps,, chocolate bar , apple and more juice. we looked forward to breakfast as we knew we were nearly at Singapore....then we were all prepared for our onward journey to Adelaide..which at just 7 hours flew by..again with Singapore Airlines. Would fly with them again.","positive"

Feeling like a cocoon, it is very private, entertainment system is really great, enough space to store your book or headphones, seat is comfortable, without the Z on bed position which i think is a real improvement However, the only small negative point is that the seat is a bit narrow with small arms rest during take off and landing, you can push it down during the flight so not a real issue. Aircraft is great even if i was expected a more quiet environment, compared with the A350 for example. I didn't mention the service and the food which were amazing.

We are paying customers too! However that was only on one(and the first) of the four flights we took, and on reflection it did look like the lady stewardess was very new. Everything done very just so. The other flights were fine. The last flight on the way back from Singapore to Heathrow afforded us the wrong menu, so food was not as advertised, and pasta starter dishes for both meals, both very dry and unappatising. Comfort wise the extra space and leg support made the word of difference. Noise cancelling headphones as standard in PE were a bonus.","positive"
"3477","Comfortable non-stop flight Great that SQ added the non-stop flight between Singapore and Seattle. Judging from full flight, it must be really popular and there is a demand for it. Whilst the premium economy seats do not recline fully, it was great that I had the first row (row 31) where there is ample leg space. Food wise, no difference from economy other than having option for champagne and a 3rd food choice. I like the fact of not having a layover.","positive"
"9722","Newer planes are better. After 4 consecutive flights with Singapore airlines, we came to the conclusion that their Airbus 330-300 was the better of them all, as it had a better degree of comfort, and bonus, a touch screen for your entertainment during your trip. Something I had trpouble with on the other flights we took during this holiday. But, oh dear, them earphones are a right pain! Surely modern airlines can do better than give one 20cents worth of technology as you enter the plane and look forwards to up to 5 hours of bum numbing entertainment as you catch up on the movies you missed last time around. Ok, the service was good and prompt, the food was average but a good standard, and you even get an ice cream afterwards if you still have room. Loved the touch screen windows which now replace the shutters which seem to annoy the cabin staff every time we land and they are down. Why one asks? Does it make for a smoother landing you wonder as the sun streams into your eyes! Smooth ride Singapore, thank you.","positive"
"7746","Flying with Singapore Airlines was Great trip, cabin Crewe attentive, food good, inflight entertainment good. The flight was at all times tranquil and relaxed. Singapore Airlines is our first choice for this long haul flight, we have used them many many times and always had excellent service.","positive"
"3852","Disappointing After leaving our cruise ship in Tokyo, we flew to Melbourne via Singapore on Singapore Airlines. I had flown with this airline many years ago and thought that it was good, so I was disappointed by our recent experience of it. The Premium Economy seats were tighter than I expected them to be and, on one flight, the seat in front of me showed signs of poor upkeep. The meals served ranged between poor and scarcely edible. The attentiveness of the pleasant staff was the only saving grace. It will be a long time before I think about flying Singapore Airlines again.","negative"
"4564","How to avoid the bus to Sydney to catch the Singapore plane if you live in Canberra Singapore Airlines gained a fifth daily flight from Sydney to Singapore and Canberra received a daily service when SQ introduced the “ loop “ SQ288 flight of Singapore to Sydney then back to Singapore daily . Being a “ loop “ flight it has only the one flight number instead of the “ even “ one way and the “ odd “ the other way . A cunning move . My poor wife , who suffers dreadfully but silently from the auto-immune disease Rheumatoid Arthritis, not to be confused with the common Osteoarthritis, dreads the sub zero mornings that Canberra endures in May to August when daily maximum temperatures may reach only into the low teens . I had promised last year that as I had enough points I would take her to Singapore for 3 weeks in June/July to escape the cold , which I did . SQ 288 starts by departing from Singapore at 10.30 am , arriving in Sydney just after 8 pm , sits there for 1 hour 10 minutes to let Sydney passengers off , collect new Singapore passengers then flies on to Canberra to arrive at 10.20 pm , disembark those returning to Canberra and then taking on Canberrans before flying directly on to Singapore at 11.15 pm , but late this time , arriving at 5.15 am Singapore time , making up time on the flight . A Loop . We flew Business 17D and 17F in the usual super-wide SQ seats as Business cabin is a 1-2-1 configuration. Everyone has aisle access . I always feel I do not get full Business benefit with night flights and this one is no different , a one course main meal straight after takeoff and a light breakfast or a snack straight after takeoff with an American Breakfast in the morning before landing , at around 3 am on this flight . I chose the latter , nothing to write home about . Also , Singapore seems to loose it’s normal “ different to other airlines “ claim by following their lead in the absence of service during the night flight . No staff in sight for hours and I dislike pushing the call button . Despite the large but hard and angled full recline seat I cannot sleep on aircraft and so hang out for the appearance of a flight attendant from whom I can request a drink . Only managed two drinks for the whole flight . I felt short changed as I am not a passenger who becomes rowdy after a few drinks . The cabin was quite hot also , so dehydration may have started . Individual water bottles had run out and no offer to top up was made due to staff absence . On time arrival in Singapore then an easy taxi into the Orchard Road area . The taxi at 32 dollars for an around a 20 kilometre trip was a bargain . With only one flight a day into Canberra , SQ does not have it’s own lounge but Business/First travellers can use the Virgin Business Lounge . Virgin also has dedicated check in counters for all SQ travellers . Passengers who have just boarded in Sydney get ushered into the Transit Lounge at Canberra after just 30 or so minutes in the air on the way down from Sydney. We await the dubious pleasure of the Sydney transit lounge on our flight back . There is a VERY limited Duty Free shopping facility in the CBR transit lounge . This new service is obviously a great benefit to country travellers wishing to avoid the trip to board in Sydney for travel to Singapore, not to mention having to find a car park and/or find accommodation in Sydney . Also , as the flight arrives at 10.20 pm at night Canberrans can avoid the morning jet-lagged car or bus trip back to Canberra after an overnight return flight . If enough passengers would justify a Sixth SQ flight into Sydney early am and then on to Canberra to collect morning passengers , that would give Canberran and country travellers the possibility of over and back daylight flights , not to mention the ability to connect with onward daytime flights to Asia, Europe or London . I realize that old age and deteriorating health , spinal operations for us both , are probably making us more critical but we could only manage a 7 out of 10 for SQ on this leg . Hopefully the daytime return will win us back","positive"
"9612","Very good Had never flown Singapore Airlines before and when looking on Skyscanner had the cheapest flight Wellington to Melbourne at short notice (9 days out). I was impressed with the leg room in economy - you could actually stretch out a bit. But the seats were a bit hard on the neck. Ask for a pillow! But the service and food was great. A hot face towel for everyone (even in Economy!) before takeoff. Food was nice. Enjoyed the flight. Flew home again with them as well which was also very good. Would recommend Singapore Airlines and would definitely fly with them again.","positive"
"4558","Plesantly surprising experience We travelled economy class on Singapore airlines to Shanghai as part of a tour package and were pleasantly surprised at the level of service and facilities offered. The hot towels and menu offerings were well received and the service was everything one could expect. Flights departed and arrived on time at the nominated terminal and checkin staff were always helpful and courteous. We would recommend Singapore Airlines as a memorable travel experience. The AirBus 350 seems a more spacious plane than the Boeing 777 while the AirBus 380 is a much noisier plane but all were clean and well presented including the toilets.","positive"

"11078","Singapore Airlines was always noted most for their cabin crew attentiveness, you read it still in their proud history in the inflight magazine. I think the slogan was 'Singapore girl, what a great way to fly'. Nowadays if you are lucky enough to be in business you will still come across one of these amazing women. However, you are more likely to get the totally uncommitted new fleet of cabin crew in economy who view the public as a bit of a nuisance and eye contact has gone. Tragedy that whoever is in charge of training cabin staff for this airline is doing a terrible job and losing loyal customers. On my flight, SQ217, Singapore to Melbourne, 10.45 on July 7, I had a rude male steward ever who did not smile once. Back to Qantas for this frequent Australia to Europe passenger.","neutral"
"8251","Foods are plentiful I took the direct flight from SF to Singapore. We took off around 11am local time and arrived in Singapore 7pm local time as well. So I think it was around 16 hours. I know it sounds a Long flight but I did not feel so. The business class seat has a big enough space. I spent my times reading couple of newspapers and magazines. Continuing my readings on my kindle. And watched couple of latest films as well. I slept around 6 hours during the whole flight. The bed was nice. But I do not like how it is slanted. The flight attendants are also friendly but professional. The foods are amazing. Sometimes I felt they are a bit too much. Between the first meal and the second meal there are quite a big gap in term of timing but you can always ask for a nice warm noodle to the flight attendant. I would not take the business class if it was a personal trip though. It can cost you up to 4 times of the economic class. I know it is cozy and all but it does not really worth it.","positive"
"3408","The Best Outstanding legroom. They fly a 747 american configuration, not the cramped 747 Asian configuration. The American 747 configuration which also allows greater hip room. Amenities are nice, and it seems that they are much better at staffing aboard the plane.","positive"

"11112","Took this flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on a business trip. Nice and real business class in a bit of an older style. Service was great. While service and the cabin crew were nice, I was quite unhappy with the cockpit crew. Upon departure the pilot talked about fair weather conditions, nothing unusual. He did not mention with any word that we need to be seated for 2 hours and being shaken around in turbulence. It even got that bad that the captain got the cabin crew seated because he said it is too dangerous for them to walk around. But 5 minutes after that, the captain comes out to go to toilet? It is not a shame to tell passengers that there may be turbulence en route.","positive"

"11265","After more than 4 years since I've flown with SQ, I continue to be impressed with their high level of service and quality. Despite the aircrafts being one of their older ones in their fleet, it was well maintained and IFE worked perfectly. Their ground service was also really good - I was 10kg over my check-in baggage limit but SQ was kind enough to waiver 5kg of that so I only had to pay the excess for 5kg. Already looking forward to my next trip with them.","positive"
"3808","Great service and friendly cabin crew Return from Bangkok yesterday evening .No complains about our friendly and helpful cabin crews on board the flight. Excellent service. The only problem about this flight was the air-con doesn't seems to be working well. Initially, I thought it was me but the others (70A. 71 A, 72A) who was seated behind me and a few others on other rows also complained about the aircraft air-con. Hope Singapore airlines will look into it and do something about it. Thanks.","positive"
"981","Disappointing I knew SG airlines are considered the best out of all but it was rather mediocre or sub par actually. Food was rather bad and they never heat up bread so it was always cold. The stewardesses seemed annoyed when I asked for a beer or any other additional small service. One girl didn't even understand the word ""butter"" and when I made a gesture of spreading on bread and she thought I was after jam and told me ""bread already sweet enough lah""and walked off I wasn't angry or anything and took it as it is what it is but I was a little surprised. Well COVID changed everything and this probably is new normal. At least all my 4 flights arrived on time and I safely returned.","negative"

The business class hardware is solid but not extravagant as Qatar or Emirates- its the service and food standard that still gives them an edge","positive"

"4106","Excellent flight experience from CGK - EWR/EWR - CGK with ordinary meals and service... Both of me and my wife decided to have a flight experience, with Singapore Airlines, in their longest route (SIN - EWR) during 3rd week of May - currently SQ holds world record for longest flight. We both were glad to have such experience while we could. To make the whole journey more pleasant, we both were able to secure bulkhead seats in all flight sectors which definitely made us fresh once we stepped out of the aircraft even after being in the flight for more than 15 hours. Although it was not our first experience taking a direct flight for more than 15 hours but we both still got so excited. Our 1st experience took place several years back when we both flew BKK-LAX/LAX-BKK route which took approx. 16~17 hours one way. This time, we decided to fly and spend time traveling to East Coast and North East Coast of US during our 21 days' trip. That's one of the main reasons why we decided to fly with SQ to EWR this time. In this trip, we both decided to take the 1st flight from CGK-SIN where we arrived in Singapore in the early morning where we had enough time to explore the city before heading back to Changi airport slightly before 7:00 pm the same day. We decided doing so because we tried not to sit too long in the aircraft and got tired/bored. By spending time in Singapore, we did some exercise (walking) and we tried to make our body a bit exhausted before we both boarded the flight before midnight. Our 1st flight (CGK-SIN) was leaving on time : Our flight touched down in Singapore slightly earlier than its original schedule. We spent more than 10 hours wandering around both in the airport and in the city before heading back to airport later that evening. Once we returned back to the airport, we both decided to enter Krisflyer Lounge and spent few hours there : We were resting a while inside the lounge and had light meals while enjoying the lounge's facility. Our 2nd flight was leaving slightly behind its original schedule but we managed to arrive in EWR almost an hour ahead of its original schedule. The flight experience was as good as we both expected with few notes. The following conclusion is my personal judgement on Singapore Airlines after flying with them for more than 35 years now : Without any doubt, they operate one of the youngest and most modern aircraft's fleets in the world. They also have one of the most entertaining IFEs among airlines in the world, one of the best seats we can find among full service airlines in the world and the list goes on. However, up to today and despite their competitive advantage as described above, I strongly believe they're still lacking particularly in their in-flight service performed by their flight attendants. I carefully evaluated how they all performed in many long haul flights and so far, they were doing average at their best. In my opinion, their in-flight service was not the best one as many passengers had claimed. There are other airlines that have much better work performance than SQ. For instance, Thai Airways, JAL etc to name a few. For me, most of their flight attendants tried to rush their work and which was good sometimes when we flew short distance such as CGK-SIN. However, in many cases especially in longer haul flights (> 2 hours), I felt I didn't get a good quality level of service as they supposed to perform. Second finding : SQ really needs to rectify/step up their food quality. We both flew in premium economy this time (they only offer 2 classes in this particular flight) and I really felt none of their meals they served throughout our flights was outstanding. They were rather ordinary as we could easily find in other flights operated by other carriers. I have flown with Singapore Airlines many times in the past in routes such as CGK-SIN, CGK-CAN, CGK-PVG, CGK-HKG and in longer route such as CGK-LAX and that's what I had observed. Our return flights' experience were more or less the same with our outbound flights with the difference we were landed in Singapore almost 2 hours early than its original schedule although the flight took off, from EWR, almost an hour behind its schedule. This condition gave us 1 1/2 hours extra to spend in Singapore (total 4 1/2 hours layover in SIN). Once again, being able to access Krisflyer Lounge really helped us a lot in getting the much needed rests. One note : SQ only provides lounge access to their business class passengers and Star Alliance Gold card holders. In EWR, they directed us to visit Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse (lounge) where we spent time a little over an hour before heading to the gate for boarding's preparation. Will I fly with SQ in the future ? The answer will be yes since they still have one of the best IFEs and airline seats in the world. As for their service and food quality, it's really not a big issue that makes me stop flying with them.","neutral"

The inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies. I tried to upgrade my seat on the return trip, got a confirmation, but when I went to check in found that the seat had changed to a worse seat then I had originally picked (middle) .

For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets. I would not be flying Singapore Airlines again.","negative"

"10312","Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice.","negative"
"7643","Overall a Very Good Experience Travelled from South Africa to Bali. Duration of flight 10.5hrs to Singapore and then 2.5hrs to Bali. Slight flight delays was experienced due to bad weather but the captain made it up in the air. Planes are old if compared to Qatar or Emirates Airlines therefore the leg room is less and the economy class movie screens are smaller. A plus is that there is onboard WIFI available which was stable for a good few hours into the flight but it is rather expensive. Service by airhostess was excellent, very friendly and always willing to help. The only downside is that they will wake you from sleep when it is time to eat. I would much prefer to sleep and eat when ready.","positive"

I was pleasantly surprised by the service and meals. Booking in took a bit longer and the Singapore airline app takes a longtime to do something. From there on everything was great. Helpful hostesses were on hand for people having difficulty with ridiculosly big, heavy carry on luggage. (I think the weight restriction is not a good idea. People should have to lift their carry on luggage above their heads by themselves). The meals provided were very good, in fact too much. But I guess they have to cater for people who dont like a particular dish. There is a menu and a choice of 2 dishes. The leg room was sufficient. There is also a video screen with your choice of movies or just look at where we are with the GPS. All in all, it was very pleasant trip. A little bit more expensive than some, but by no means exorbitant. Recommend it and will go again.","positive"

"6358","Good service - tired planes It’s been a few years since I last flew with Singapore Airlines and I have to say I noticed the difference. Tired and old planes have the overall experience a bit of a dampening. I felt the food served was also a bit tired and lacked imagination. The staff were excellent as always and the checkin - both online and on the ground at the airport - we’re both excellent. Overall - an OK experience","positive"

"1684","Nice sized business class seats The seats were a nice size with ample storage, service was good and we were well looked after. the one critisiem I would make is that being 6' tall the leg space to lie down flat was off set which for me made it slightly uncomfortable on a 14 hour flight. However much better than some other airlines.","positive"
"488","Flying to Europe, 1st leg Brisbane to Singapore - Always good service This is the 3rd time we've flown with Singapore airline and we still enjoy their service. The flight out of Brisbane was on time. We didn't have reserved seats and were given 67J&K and we didn't have anyone else in our 3 seat row so we spread out which was nice. The service by the crew is always professional. They served the meal then the lights were dimmed. They constantly bring water and refreshments around so we kept our fluids up and didn't get dehydrated. The Kris inflight entertainment system is great with heaps to chose from. They have some of the latest movies out so it was nice to watch them. It was only a 7hr flight so nice and short for the 1st hop. The plane landed on time in Singapore to a warm barmy night. Cant recommend Singapore airlines enough.","positive"
"2447","Superb Flight was great. Service excellent. Stayed over in Singapore for 10 hours and made use of the free sightseeing trip of Singapore and the SD20 voucher - which we used for the lounge - which was magic and great to freshen up before the long leg home.","positive"
"9913","From Perth to Hanoi in comfort What can one say about Singapore Airlines but give them the praise and accolades that they deserve. From the time one checks in their baggage , the service attendants are so courteous and helpful, to ensure our mind are at ease and to ensure our comfort on board will be enjoyed to the full. The on board service hostesses are the best, very attentive and nothing is too much trouble for these beautiful ladies to do for you, as well as all the other on board staff. I will certainly be e using Singapore Airlines in the future whenever possible.","positive"
"11279","We travelled on April 26th Brisbane Australia to Singapore then onto Paris. Came back Munich to Singapore Singapore to Brisbane.

"4258","Long haul As most Aussie’s who have the fortune to fly know, the long haul to Europe is a teeth gritting and keep smiling until it’s over affair. Singapore Airlines makes this just more enjoyable and endurable. Comfy seats, excellent and efficient flight attendants, frequent fluid offers, and ok meals make for a comfy journey. Efficient boarding schedules and kiosk checkins all contribute to an excellent service. And the hot face washers are sooo refreshing. I was extremely late for a flight but they still managed to accommodate me and my luggage without any fuss. Great service and can only highly recommend","positive"
"1966","Space between seats. Flew on the new airbus A350 from Singapore to Jakarta and felt like I was on a budget airline because the space between the seats was so tight. The screen on the back of the seat was right in my face and I had barely any space left to breathe when I put the tray down for food service. This is a disgrace especially when you pay a premium price and have to be crowded in like sardines. Normally fly premium economy or business and had no idea things were this bad in economy. Seems like the Boeing 777 had more space in economy. Will definitely not use this airline if they are going to try to squeeze so many seats onto their new planes.","negative"
"4403","SQ38 Great Experience SQ 38 on 9th July 2019 Great long haul flight. The crew were fantastic. So welcoming and professional. They are always ready to serve and constantly looking out for our needs. Indeed best airline. The flight was smooth despite some bumpy times but the seats were so comfortable that you can just sleep over the turbulence. Put down the back rest and sleep with the bed. The biz class is so spacious. Well done Singapore Airlines.. and thank you. Looking forward to our return flight.","positive"
"7279","Fabulous Airline I have flown Singapore Airlines in the past and been very impressed, but this was my first trip on the double decker. My expectations were more than met. The staff is professional, immaculately dressed, and willing to personally assist as needed. The food was excellent from start to finish, including presentation, taste and variety. I especially appreciated the fact that they didn't over use seasonings. The cabin had tasteful holiday decorations. The bathrooms were well equipped and clean.","positive"
"10885","Frankfurt to Singapore was my first trip with Singapore Airlines and the journey was flawless. The staff was nice and helpful, on ground and in the plane, the flight was on time. I had a Boeing 777 on the way in and A380 on the way back, and, since that was my first travel with the A380, I'll focus on this one. First of all, this plane is awesome! It's so massive and super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn't find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion. Seat was ok, I could sleep without too much discomfort, entertainment system was fine, no complaints about it. In the end, I had two nice flights, I really enjoy them but, I didn't find that the Premium Economy in a 5 stars airline was much different that a 4 star one. So, I'd recommend Singapore Airline, but, if you find the same seat category for less money in a less prestigious airline, I'd switch for the second one.","positive"
"10085","Just arrived today Jul 31 with SQ892. Flight full, Krisworld connection Wi-fi Inconsistent.

"1519","Great trip from Male to Changi Having had a ghastly flight from Changi to the Maldives on SilkAir two weeks earlier, I was dreading the return leg however it was 100% different. I'd booked a legroom seat and the helpful attendant said that the whole bulkhead row was free if I really wanted to stretch out, which was great not only for me, but the couple on the front row next to me. The flight was great with good food and super staff.","positive"

"8870","Good Good flight. Midnight one with children aboard. They are obviously very tired at this time and one fully screamed for nearly 2 hours. Once fed, he fell asleep with not a peep heard. Got a meal at around 1am. And breaky close to landing at Frankfurt. Same boring movies as the previous flight .. food good but even dinner was eggs. Better selection for vegetarians..","positive"

"5937","Let’s get the food varied a bit! Started in Colombo Economy. Food was very ordinary, especially the tuns and coleslaw (bit like cat food!) chicken with creamy mustard sauce bit rubbery. Service was fine. A group of us were then continuing to Melbourne Premium Economy. Imagine our surprise to get the same menu of tuna etc. Wasn’t good the first time, didn’t want it again within 24 hours. Come on Singapore surely there could have been other food options, VERY disappointing.Once again service good, food very poor.","neutral"

"7369","Questionable service Prior to my flight, I was so excited to be flying with the world’s number one airline. But boy was I disappointed! Hubby and I asked for a drink soon after takeoff, which was not served until well after dinner despite numerous reminders to the cabin crew. Dinner was served on time, but the trays weren’t cleared for the next 45 mins for any of the passengers. Some people made their concerns known, to which the senior cabin crew advised they were working with a new crew and trying something new. But at the expense of the comfort of the passengers? Is it worth it I ask?","negative"

I'm reasonably tall (5'8"") with long legs, but I had plenty of seat room. Service was exemplary, and I liked the extra touches of menus and the little convenience bag, containing socks, toothpaste and toothbrush, and an eyeshade. Food was pretty good, and the entertainment choices excellent. Despite a tight connection in Singapore (50 minutes) I still had plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.","positive"

"11089","Singapore to Yangon with Singapore Airlines and they did not disappoint. Always friendly crew, food was ok but breakfast is not my favorite anyway. The IFE in my opinion had good selection but I think they need to upgrade the moving map, perhaps it is different in a long haul sector but I am not sure. They flew a A330 which was bigger than I thought. Check in was swift and flight took off and landed on time.","positive"

"9599","Very well organised service although I think I would have liked another stop over Well organised flight. I was very impressed with how organised they were with boarding and having flights leave on time. The meals were quite nice - I had Indian vegetarian, although I would say that the food was nicer on the way to London then on the way back. The staff were pleasant. I was also impressed with cleanliness. I'm sure the toilets for instance were cleaned a number of times on the flight. The in-house movies were pretty tired and ordinary looking though. The flight is a very long one so I would like to see an option to have another stopover. I should also say that it was nice that the airline was able to have my baggage put right through to London instead of having to pick it up at Singapore and put it on for the next flight.","positive"

We were lucky to bid and be accepted for an upgrade on our outbound journey to Premium Economy, this was excellent, great seats, entertainment, the cabin crew were attentive and their service exemplary. The meal - beef and black bean - was the best thing I have ever eaten on a plane - exceptional! On the return journey we were in Economy but the service levels were no different. Excellent airline, many long haul providers should take note!","positive"

Despite changing three times on the headphone, problems still reflected on the sound output system in my seat. While I was about to gave up enjoying the entertainment, Mr Heidizayat and his team patiently searched from empty seat to seats, tested on the audio system till perfection before guiding me to the new seat.

"10075","Singapore Airlines continues to provide consistently high quality on-board service. Cabin crew are always polite, friendly, helpful and professional. Seat design varies according to aircraft type and route. Some work better than others. Lounge quality varies - especially when not operated by Singapore Airlines. Food and beverage quality, choice and delivery remain a very high standard. Cabin service runs like clockwork and team co-operation works well and this shows. IFE was excellent. Priority tags sometimes don't work in that priority baggage arrives anytime - not always first.","positive"
"5328","Not as good as Air New Zealand To me the benchmark for business class is Air NZ, and Singapore Airlines has a long way to go to match the service experience they offer. The seat is large, but the lie flat bed is awkward and not as comfortable. Crew onboard were not that friendly and it did not feel like a premium experience.","neutral"

"11310","We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore.","negative"
"5716","Excellent Airline I had never flown with Singapore Airlines before now, but i can say its one of the best. The cabin crew were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble.

"5076","Flight service Touched by the service of SQ flight stewardess en route to Yangoon. One of the stewardess addressed me by my name without introduction.

"2069","Comfort and service 1st half I had a great first flight from Amsterdam to Singapore. The plane travelled in had more legroom than usual and seats more comfortable, the crew were constantly around with trays of water or juice. Each time I got up for a stretch I returned to my seat loaded with snacks which really helped the 6 movies go by. Flight crew were all lovely and extremely friendly, would fly with them again. Main meals were very good. Second leg not so great, legroom almost nonexistent and the seats were nowhere near as comfortable, while the service was still good, this crew were not around the cabin as much and this really let them down, meals very ordinary. Nowhere near as good as the first flight, hence I am giving 4 stars instead of five but overall not too bad for a fully packed plane.","positive"
"1442","Dismal hotel arrangement when Singapore airline bump your flights Our flight was bumped by a day, I had to call 4 times before hotel accommodation was finally given for the extra lay over (was supposed to be only a 3 hr stop in Singapore). The customer server rep insisted it was only a 3 hr layover and we had to keep pointing out the date has been pushed out for a day. Wait time for each call was at least an hour. The voucher given to us stated the hotel was $242 USD/night, but it's only listed for $120 on hotels.com. The hotel smelled like wet towel and tobacco, walls were very thin and we could hear next door coughing non-stop. There were food container trays in the hallway. We were told this is the only hotel available, but there were plenty much nicer hotels available. We ended up moving to Marriott (out of our own pocket) down the road, at least 2 stars higher and much cheaper than the price quoted on airline contract. With so many good and available hotels in Singapore there is no excuse for what they put us through. Quite disappointed.","neutral"

When we are about to land, a passenger went into toilet, the Male Flight attendant asked him before he went in “can you hold ?” The passenger shook his head &’went in, subsequently the flight attendant talk to us (all the passengers), this kind of people caused landing to delay. After a while the flight attendant went on to knock on the toilet door & shouted to ask the passenger to come out quickly. Moscow - Singapore 2 Jan 2020. The question is that does SIA inform their passengers how much alcohol they can consume ? I heard a female flight attendant said “he has drank a lot” in Mandarin to another flight attendant. Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said “this is a plane not a bar”, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol. SIA has to make a decision, either no alcohol, limited alcohol (informed passengers before booking of tickets) or free flow, find a way to handle it instead of being rude to passengers.","positive"

"5845","Don’t buy Premium Economy for the food Departure from Singapore for Melbourne was on time, however boarding was chaotic. Premium Economy seat was more comfortable, wider and apparently with a greater incline and leg room. I had traveled all of the previous night with a 7:45am boarding in Singapore and the only option on board was a continental breakfast; 5 cubes of fruit, a small burnt croissant but a very nice muffin, inadequate! For lunch I chose oriental style pork: tasteless pork with a very thick sauce, well-seasoned rice and steamed unseasoned vegetables. The sauce (being kind) was so thick it could not be incorporated with any other element of the dish; it was a separate unpleasant gelatinous ‘entity’.","neutral"

"2908","Singapore hype didn’t stand up to scrutiny I had read so much about how good Singapore Airlines was, however the reality was somewhat different. We flew Brisbane - Singapore- Kuala Lumpur in Business class and I have to say it didn’t meet my expectations as I have flown on many different airlines. The meals had a very limited choice and my daughter’s pre ordered special meal didn’t arrive at all. This wasn’t just a glitch as other customers made the same complaint. The lie flat bed was uncomfortable and no seat covering was offered. On the Singapore to KL leg no alcohol was available for the short 35 minute flight. The Lounge in KL was extremely underwhelming to say the least, it is about the size of a large home lounge room and has one toilet per sex with no amenities. The meal choice in the lounge is very limited, and no champagne! The staff didn’t seem to be in any hurry to clear plates which made the cramped space very untidy. Overall I was disappointed.","neutral"
"6911","Tight space, attentive service Overnight flight in an huge Airbus 380 aircraft. However, boarding was orderly despite the large number of passengers. Singapore Airlines offers an attractive alternative to Lufthansa on this route. The flight continues from Frankfurt to Singapore. I was going to Frankfurt. A dinner is served -- a menu card provided. Two entree choices -- no vegetarian option. A small amenity kit provided. Early morning light breakfast provided. Alcoholic drinks complimentary. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the easy to use TV consoles on the back of seats. Power outlets available. Ear phones provided. I was surprised at how cramped the seats were. Should the person in front recline his/her seat, you can neither read, eat, or watch your show. In fact, while serving meals, the flight attendants constantly asked the passengers to get their back seats pulled forward. The plane was late in taking off due to weather problems but arrived on time. You can earn miles on Star Alliance for flying on Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"4833","Great flight I flew a late afternoon flight to Singapore and it was good. I was lucky enough to have an aisle seat and it had a decent amount of leg room. The seats were comfortable and certainly wide enough. The inflight entertainment had a very wide range of viewing options, ranging from the latest movies to BBC comedies and documentaries. A lot of Asian and Indian content too, so more than enough to keep you entertained on the flight. The cabin crew were superb (As always with Singapore Airline). They could not be more helpful, cheerful and efficient. A big thumbs up to them. The food was certainly a highlight of the flight for me. I was lucky enough to have, I think it was called Bombo chicken with rice. It was an Indonesian meal and was superb. I mean really tasty and well cooked. For desert was Mrs Beer vanilla ice cream which was certainly a high grade ice cream. The flight was smooth and certainly could not be criticised in any way or form. I will definitely be flying with Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"7037","NOW MY NUMBER 1 heres why * Having flown with middle eastern airlines the last 2 years I went back to Singapore for a try. Well I found the business class product better than last time A HUGE IMPROVEMENT! The staff were great, the Sin - Per aircraft was updated from the last time I flew this route 787-10 now. I wanted to fly the A380 from LHR- Sin but was full due to time of year (Chinese new year) so was a bit worried as last time I flew singapore the aircraft was dated and tired looking . However this was one of the updated planes and it was fantastic- I'd say it was one of the best flying experiences in my 30 yrs of travel (incl first class) . I really enjoyed the flight which at 13 hrs is a big plus. The chair was full flat as expected and very comfortable. The ife and The Movies were not as expansive as Emirates but I had work to do so could live with that. The screen was NOT touch screen like the 787-10 which was a pain , I think this has been upgraded now on alot of long haul flights ? I think this is the only let down at the moment they should try and get some more blockbuster New release movies and shows.... Food was top notch I booked the chef and had the lobster (famous for SINAIR ) it was delicious. The wine was good, with Charles Heidseick flowing nicely but I did have to ask when boarded as it wasnt offered with the initial drinks. Had a few hrs sleep no problems and the staff onboard were great with my little kid. The wifi was complimentary but did drop a fair bit but I managed to get a bit done. 5 stars - I'm now won back over, sorry emirates. I will be flying Singapore more often now. WELL DONE on a great product. Singapore lounge is one of my favourite- see my review of it. 5 stars","positive"
"9530","Singapore girl....what a great way to fly. Had heard a lot of hype about how good this carrier was and it turned out to be true. Cabin staff very attentive and helpful and the cabin space was comfortable. Good range of tasty meals and drinks to help the time go by.","positive"
"3995","Suggestion: Please provide bottle of water to economy passengers. Everything was good....the food, service and entertainment. A major disappointment: they do not provide water bottles to economy passengers on long haul fights. Every time you ask they pour around 100 ml water in a small glass. By the time I reached Melbourne I was dehydrated and fell sick post the flight. I would suggest to buy your own big water bottle before boarding economy to avoid getting sick. Dear Singapore Airlines, you could have reduced some of the so many snacks, instead a good bottle of water would have been appreciated :)","positive"
"4392","The most Airline we used for traveling SQ is one of the best Airlines we use to travel every time we go overseas. Why?? The most important is always on time. Even though the price is a bit higher than most of the airlines, but we feel it’s worth it. I am also a member of Kris Flyer. The process of check in is very easy n comfortable. The plane, the food, the service are good. SQ is a very recommended airline.","positive"
"3045","Attentive staff make long haul comfortable Check in was fast and efficient and loaded passengers from the back of the plane first. This lessened passengers waiting time to get to their seats while others were stowing their luggage. Much more logical. Attendants regularly came around offering water - not all airlines do this. Economy seats were a little larger and comfortable than others we have experienced. And they still bring the hot towels to you!","positive"
"853","Fraudulent Charges on my Credit Card I book 2 tickets in expedia for S$ 1248. Expedia charge my card S$ 624 per ticket and total sum of S$ 1248 but then Singapore Airlines fraudulently charges S$ 1248 again. I called UOB Bank and bank staff Sanju who was handling fraudulent transaction help line tells me that I need to ask Singapore Airlines to send the message to not to charge this amount. I just hope Singapore Airlines stop this policy to charge again for the booking not made on their website instead made on OTA website. Singapore Airlines can contact me on +65-91808379 to resolve the issue and arrange the refund for the amount not charged or authorized on their website.","negative"
"480","What is all the fuss about. Disappointed with this flight. Thought Singapore Airlines was the gold standard. It was just ordinary. We took off on time which was great as it was a late night flight and arrived ahead of schedule. Premium economy was a small cabin (24 seats) but there was not much to suggest this class and the massive upcharge over economy. The seat recline was quite clever (A350) in that on full recline it slide so as not to encroach too much on the passenger space behind. The noise cancelling headphones were effective and the entertainment screen was larger than in economy with a very good selection of films, music, TV etc. but there was not other amenity except a bottle of water. You could 'book a cook' which expanded the food selection considerably (mainly Asian cuisine though) but nearing midnight, who can face a meal? There were two full service meals. We only had the second one and it was acceptable. The cabin crew did the bare minimum and hid away for much of flight. However, when called, they responded quickly and politely. The wearing of masks did not help their cause, it was difficult to understand them and it felt like a medical flight! The lavatories deteriorated over the length of the flight and things like paper towels etc were poorly managed. I always thought BA were poor but they aren't that bad having now flown Singapore Airlines.","neutral"

"81","Disappointed We recently traveled on Singapore airliner on an 17 hr flight to Asia. With its ticket price I expect a better service than its competitors airlines but am surprised that it has been reduced to average. Other than the hot tower that still remains, the food is average and there is no offer of any snack between meals and very infrequent offer of drinks and no more choice’s of drinks other than water. On the return flight there was a rush to serve meal just before landing.","neutral"
"6543","Best & Comfortable travel so far Singapore airlines is one of the best and well known airline in the word.. We had a great and comfortable experience with it while travelling with a kid (2.5yrs old).

My parents also travelled to Perth with SA & had a comfortable flight. I always recommend SA to everyone 🙂","positive"

"6222","Not as expected I was looking forward to flying with Singapore airlines. Boarding was ok and the plane was older but clean. The seats were good but expected a bit more padding on the seats given the price. Legroom however was good. I had a special meal which was served an hour before everyone else which was ok. The flight itself was quite turbulent. Some of the flight attendants were polite but others were not. They did offer frequent drinks and kept us hydrated. Why do they insist the window blinds be kept down nearly the whole flight its beyond me. Arrived on time. The experience was good but did expect more from them given they were the best voted airline. Hoping my return journey will be better","neutral"
"10443","Flew Singapore Airlines Jakarta to Singapore and back. It’s still a great airline to fly. Seats was still 9 abreast on 777. Food was great. Entertainment was great, but it’s limited compared to Emirates or Qatar Airways but still acceptable. Price was expensive a bit but still worth it. Return flight in the A350 was more greater than this flight. Overall a great flight with SQ and will fly with them again.","positive"
"3645","Lapsing sometimes into the ordinary. I can't remember the flight number, but it was the 0720 from Changi. It didn't start well after the Terminal of departure was changed from 3 to 1. The big problem with this terminal, is the gates have no bathroom facilities once you pass security. As we are Kriss Flyer Gold members the boarding was fine and we were soon seated in a new kind of economy seat. They don't seem as deep as the previous ones, but in my opinion, were quite comfortable. An added trial for the crew was the persistent turbulence for the first half of the journey and having to deal with passengers that think the seat belt sign doesn't mean them. This despite the entire crew being strapped in! The meal was adequate and quite tasty, but due to the conditions, the tray remained on your table for a long time. The meal on arrival has really deteriorated into basically a pie! Nothing else but a drink to go with it. Looking around the plane, there were an awful lot of them refused or left. I don't think it is adequate to dish up a dry pie in a cardboard box! It smacks more of Air Asia than a Premier Airline. The crew were courteous and efficient, without being over friendly. Perhaps this is how they are told to behave. Singapore Airlines is still one of the best, but cracks are beginning to show on some flights.","positive"

Very helpful, helped me with carry on luggage, attended to my requests, meal was tasteful. I would certainly travel with them again.","positive"
"10548","Mumbai to Singapore. Great Flight, departed/arrived on time. Excellent service. The hard product was the older seat which was significantly worse than the newer ones. This is because the A330s will be retired soon and replaced with Boeing 787 and A350s. I would advise that if possible you catch the A380 flight which leaves around the same time as it would be a better choice in my opinion especially if travelling in business class. Paid roughly 470 SGD for a return ticket which is a great price.","positive"

"897","You pay $10,000 for a flight on ANY other airline and … You are on board 45 minutes before takeoff, you are settling in either to do work or to go to sleep because you have precious little time, and you are not besieged with a fully mask policy. Not here. And you are suffocating with masks in a stuffy hot waiting area (and on board). These non-N95 masks do little to prevent anything (half the meetings I just had in Singapore had locals who were suffering from COVID, but I it had been a while since someone in my US world was sidelined). Further, do the epidemiological work of looking at how hyper clean airplane environments provide cleaner air than anything, except perhaps for 100% wearers of N95 masks—and even that is not clear (and, BTW, look around at all the people who are constantly pretending to eat and drink to avoid wearing a mask—who then really believes that masks are doing anything). This is probably a good—maybe great—airline for coach. But for people who pay premium, LET ME OUT of the COVID theater that somehow forgot about the people who pay a little bit extra. And BTW, I am a liberal Democrat who happens to be a fact-based scientist who realizes we need to find a balance between living and an hyper-controlled environment that has kept me from even getting a common cold in the last 3 years.","negative"

"9006","Making a trial bearable It's a l-o-n-g way! After doing the trip on Emirates economy last year, I thought that there had to be a better way. SAL economy plus was a great improvement. Even with the occupants in front trampolining on full recline for most of the trip my (6'1"") knees had some space. Baggage drop off and boarding were so much better, too. Food was varied, hot and ample, whilst Catherine looked after us in a personal way and made excellent Singapore Slings. The other cabin staff were pleasant and helpful, particularly the manager. The seats, unsurprisingly, became harder by the hour, whilst the economy plus cabin was remarkably quiet, though full. The Airbus on the second leg was much more pleasant than the Boeing 777 of the first leg. On that, all that could be seen out if the window was the wing and, being located near the engine exhausts, the noise was bad. The Airbus seating was in front of the wings and engines. I don't dread the return trip like I did last year.","positive"

"3895","unbelievable ,extremely poor service when asking for a quotation. my wife and i are planing a trip to melbourne in march ,we were also going to visit family in new zealand for a few days but as it became apparent singapore airlines could not offer any flights to or from wellington ,they said that they had no partner airlines and no code shares so we would need to make our owm arrangements from wellington to melbourne.we were very keen to fly with singapore airlines and especially in the wonderfull suites and keen to book with only one company we decided to drop the wellington part of our trip and simply fly london to singapore, stay at the fullerton hotel for a 3 night stop off then go to melbourne for 18 days with friends then back to singapore for 4 nights at raffles , then back to london. the problem started when i telephoned singapore airlines and passed on my itinary, the chap that i spoke to obviously had trouble understanding what i was trying to say , and i really struggled to understand him. i was put on hold a number of times and when i suggested that he lookup the details and call me back , he said that it was not possible .when i received an email it had not included the hotels that i had requested ,so i sent an email to ask why, I was told that singapore airlines could not book the fullerton hotel so i would have to book it myself ,i then asked to stay at the manderine oriental hotel and again i was told that i would need to book this hotel myself as singapore airlines did not offer this hotel. i m not sure if that is true or if the person dealing with my enquiry just could not be bothered,but i was sent a link to a list of hotels that i could choose from.i was astonished as all of the other airlines that i had sent the same information to had replied with no problems, and because we wanted to travel on a single booking i did not want to book a separate hotel.i sent a complaint to singapore airlines and not only did they not take me seriously but if anything the service got even worse.each time i emailed it took at least 2 days for them to reply ,even though they sent an immediate acknowledgement. when they did reply it was as if they did not understand that all i wanted was a quotation that included the items listed on my enquiry . finally after 9 emails i received a telephone call from a member of staff who seemed to imply that it was probably my misunderstanding before hanging up just as i started to speak. i have sent a follow up email stating that i feel that it was probably time to move on and spend my £19,000.00 with another airline, but i have received no more correspondance . it is a real shame because as i explained to singapore airlines on a number of ocasions, we were both really looking forward to traveling in the wonderful suites.","negative"

I arrive in Singapore where I have to get a boarding pass. Cathway Pacific couldn't print it for me. I go to the transfer desk and show the lady my passport, and ticket information from Cathway Pacific. She informes me that I need to pay for one of my bags, the ones that are already checked all the way to Johannesburg. Not wanting to argue I say sure and pull out my credit card. She then informs me it has to be cash. 150 US dollars, well I don't have 150 cash on me. When I travel I use credit and carry very little cash on me. So she tells me to go to an atm, or go out and clear customs and security. Which is a real hassle in of its self. So I leave and clear customs, and security go all the way out to the ticket counter. I arrive and hand the lady my passport and Cathway Pacific paper work just like at the transfer desk. The lady asks me if I have 2 bags, I reply yes ma'am and she prints my boarding pass. Just like that no mention whatsoever about a fee. The fact that this lady wanted cash and only cash makes me think she is scamming customers who fly with Singapore airlines. So be warned if you are transferring through Singapore.","neutral"

I travelled on a B777-300ER outbound and Airbus A350 for the return, both in economy and found both to be clean and in good order. The cabin crew were friendly, professional and attentive on both flights. The only real change post covid-19 was the food was not as plentiful as before, and no hot towel was provided. In particular on SQ221, the overnight return SIN-SYD, it was annoying that only dinner is now served - they used to also serve a light breakfast prior to the arrival into Sydney - even a coffee would have been better than the nothing which was provided. While they are great in the air, they are horrible with customer service over the phone to organise/manage bookings. I was making another booking and there was a website error, and when I called the Australian call centre, they wanted to charge an extra couple of hundred dollars or so than the price the website was displaying, saying their system was what mattered and it didn't matter what the website was saying. Isn't advertising a price and then not honouring it illegal under Australian Consumer Law? As I was in Singapore, I was able to visit them in person, and there thankfully they were sensible and realised I should be charged the price the website says even and were able to override their back-end system which said no availability at that price-point. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to visit in person though; I probably would have referred them to Department of Fair Trading or the ACCC or similar for advertising a price on the website as being available, and refusing to honour it when you get to the very final step of payment.","positive"

Less understandable was the disorganized response, which included vague instructions on updates, a lack of transparency on continued delays after weather cleared. The flight departed late and I was told that my luggage would be on my connecting flight, but when I landed in HKG it was not. When I contacted SIA they refused to offer me any compensation for my delayed flight, and asked for an e-ticket number for my original Scoot ticket (e-ticket numbers are nowhere to be found on Scoot ticket receipts or in the booking on the app, which disappears after your flight date). Everything they did to help was simply a deflection of responsibility.","negative"
"9043","Nice flight from HKG to CHC We recently flew to Christchurch, New Zealand with Singapore Airline with a layover in Singapore. The flights were good across the board. Flights were booked online at the Singapore Airline website, email confirmations were received in a timely manner. Check-in at HKG was quick and easy. Our first flight between HKG and SIN departed and arrived on time and was comfortable. In-flight meal was ok, movies and other entertainment fine for a 3 hour flight. Layover at Changi Airport was as good as it gets. This is a great airport when it comes departure area and in-transit experiences. Orchard gardens, butterfly gardens, koi ponds, Osim chairs and other comfortable seating throughout the various terminals makes for a relaxing place to await outbound flights leaving Changi Airport. Our second flight from SIN to CHC was really good. Departure and arrivals were on time. Seats comfortable with plenty of leg space, allowing decent rest during the long flight. We slept surprisingly well during the flight. Meals served were decent, in-flight entertainment was sufficient with a good mix of movies and TV shows. Immigration processing was quick in Christchurch, luggage was received no longer then 20-25 minutes after we had disembarked, customs were cleared and we were picking up our rental vehicle in no longer than 40-45 minutes after arriving. Overall, this was a seamless and good overall flight experience with Singapore Airline.","positive"

Foftunately only paid for the upgrade on the leg from London to Singapore ( which is 14 hrs ) so got it at a lower price. The premium Economy was only 3/4 full yet the Economy was full tells you something.Also costs to pick a particular seat in economy was also too expensive if you wanted to do it early.

"4368","Very nice flight Had a great flight. Everything on time and the staff were very helpful. The plain was nice and clean & legroom good. Food was above average - I don’t really like Airline food but this was nice. Served with a choice of drinks plus beer or wine also. Will definitely use Singapore Airlines again.","positive"

Boarding friendly and efficient, departure on time, very modern and immaculately clean aircraft, best legroom, excellent on board entertainment system, cabin crew were friendly and efficient, good menu, excellent drink selection, smooth flight, arrival on time. We would highly recommend.","positive"
"9862","A better than average experience check in was very good, had a stop in Singapore and had to change terminals, very easy and well marked. Seats ok but not as comfortable as I expected and legroom a bit tight however a huge improvement on economy. Premium Economy still have to share toilets with Economy. Staff could have been more friendly. However polite just a little aloof. Would definitely fly with Singapore again.","positive"
"353","Lovely staff but take some food! On a 13.5 hour flight we were only fed twice: breakfast at take off and supper before landing! No snacks brought round except water! The food was nice when it did come. Otherwise lovely staff; pretty standard cabin leg space, film choices etc. Singapore airport is very pricey! Most expensive pack of mints ever bought from WHSmiths!","neutral"
"10841","Singapore to Bangkok return. Staff are friendly and helpful. However on this flight, service seems rushed. It felt that they were rushing to complete many tasks. Although it didn't affect me, their stress didn't give me a very relaxed feel. Knowing that this a short flight, I can understand why they were rushing to complete tasks. If they can mask that stress, that will be perfect. This was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was a bit dated. It didn't bother me much as I had my own book to keep me occupied on the journey. Overall, it was a good flight.","positive"
"7650","Great Service! Staff cannot do enough to help you. We did have a problem with a headphone connection and they couldn’t do enough to make us happy. Always feel safe on their flights as their service record is good.","positive"
"7036","Attentive Cabin Crew My wife and I were on our way home from a 6 week cruising vacation to Indonesia and Australia. We now find that we need to have Mobility Assistance when we travel and we were looked after very well from check in to the lounge. Whilst the food was not particularly to our liking in the lounge it did not bother us too much. At an appropriate time we were collected and wheeled to the A380 aircraft departure gate and onto the aircraft; all this went very smoothly and we were welcomed aboard and looked after. The seat arrangements vary so much on different airlines, especially when the seats are converted to beds and this is where I had a problem. The 'cubby hole' where my feet would reside when laying down was too small for me so was a little uncomfortable but suited my wife very well. It is a long flight and food and entertainment was very acceptable, but that is what I have come to expect from this airline. On arrival at Heathrow, we were dealt with very proficiently by the waiting PRM service and soon gathered our baggage from the carousel. We have always rated this airline and continue to do so after this flight.","positive"
"11370","SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.","positive"
"432","Outstanding service Very good comfort and exceptional service served by the professional SQ crews onboard. Foods quality is not bad but sleeping on the bed during the flight is nice. Enjoyed seating by the window. Enjoyed Singapore sling and lamb chops. Mee Siam is ok but needs improvement. Was hoping to book the cook - hainesese chicken rice but heard from friends that it's just average. I wish to let you all at Singapore airlines know what can be improved for hainesese chicken rice - apparently more flavour? 🙏😃🇸🇬. The SIA lounge at terminal 3 was very good and got a lot of food choices to choose from. I would definitely recommend to anyone to try Singapore airlines as it's unique air experience. I have been flying with SIA quite a lot and will still use this airlines at some point in future.","positive"
"2951","A350 uncomfortable seats Airbus A350 economy seats the hardest and most uncomfortable I have ever had to sit in. If Singapore Airlines staff read this, I suggest they travel economy on an A350 and see for themselves. Of course, when they travel, they fly premium or business so would have no idea. I will never in future travel on a flight using A350","negative"
"10616","Singapore Airlines lived up to its incredible reputation. The flight attendants, especially the purser, were fun to interact with throughout the flight. The beef rendang choice I had was delicious and the wine and champagne served was truly in-flight dining at its best. The in-flight entertainment had quite a selection of current movies, so we had plenty of options to keep ourselves entertained. We were staying overnight at the Aerotel and the purser gave us some water and slippers for us to have on our journey. Although the cabin was pretty full, the cabin crew made us feel like we were on our own private jet. I'd highly recommend Singapore Airlines, based on this experience.","positive"
"2370","Premium Economy Used SA flying to and from Amsterdam/Auckland. We were quite happy with our choice (Pre,ium Economy. Lots of free leg space and very relaxed (2 window seats). Very nice personnel and good food with very nice selections (mostly rice/Nasi). We loved it. Frequent visit by cabin crew with additional food and drinks during the 4 flights (forth and back). We will definately choose for Premium Economy again next time when flying long distances.","positive"
"5671","Singapore Airlines: Simply the Best!! 3/31/19 we flew Business Class on Singapore Airlines Flight 31, an Airbus A350-900, nonstop from San Francisco to Singapore. At check in, the agent stepped from behind the counter and greeted us warmly. Check in was a breeze and we were soon on our way to the United Polaris Club at SFO (No Silver Kris Lounge any more at SFO). I took a hot shower, changed into comfortable clothing for our long flight, and joined my wife for breakfast. We were greeted at the door of the aircraft by the very friendly Singapore flight crew who escorted us to our seats in the beautiful Business Class cabin. We soon had a welcoming drink in hand (a mimosa) as we explored our seats and the extraordinary variety of entertainment options. The cabin is very comfortable and quiet. Within an hour after takeoff from SFO, we were served our dinners which had been pre-selected through Singapore's ""Book the Cook"" option. The appetizer, entrée (NY steak with asparagus, carrots), and dessert (a wonderful mango pana cotta) were all delicious. Mid way through the flight, I had the Chinese chicken stir fry (again, delicious). Finally, prior to arrival, a final light snack was served. This was the longest flight we've ever taken anywhere at 16 hours 45 minutes. But throughout the flight, the attentiveness and kindness of the crew made every minute of this epic flight most enjoyable. This is what an airline should be. We can't wait to fly with Singapore again some day.","positive"
"8896","One of my favorites Everything about SA is well done. On time service, quality of the airplanes, meals (!!!), and their personnel. Really a great airline, probably one of the 3 or 4 best in the world.","positive"
"3393","A great experience We took the flight from Delhi to Singapore and Visa-Versa. Both the time it was a great experience travelling with Singapore Airlines. From ground service till Cabin Service it was simply best. For us, the seats were comfortable. They provide all kind of amenities like a blanket, a pillow, earphones, earbuds etc. Cable staff were friendly and welcoming, and always ready to accede to your requests. Inflight entertainment was also excellent. As it is a Full-Service carrier, they offered complimentary Food and beverage as well. We got the option between Indian and Continental meal. I will suggest, post-booking the tickets, please update your meal preference so that they can arrange the same accordingly and you can enjoy your meal. They have multiple food options. Few suggestions for Airlines. 1) Please make the TV screens angle adjustable so that any person can adjust the screen as per his/her need. Also, remote buttons are hard to press. Please replace those faulty remotes. 2) Add more collection in the Indian movies sections. 3) I have booked 4 Indian Non-Veg meals, but both the time received only three as it was finished. Please have sufficient meals at least for those passengers who pre-booked their meals. Rest it was very good experience travelling with Singapore Airlines. In future, we would love to fly again with them because of their great hospitality.","positive"
"5301","Going on holiday As usual Singapore Airlines service was flawless, from check-in to baggage claim. We had great seats in the exit row. My least favourite thing was the food. It could definitely be better.","positive"
"2034","Great planes - quiet and we are tall and seats had good space to stretch Their plans are nice and quiet and good leg space and actually comfortable seats for such a long journey. Actually first time I and my wife have slept for more than a couple of hours (seven) due to cramped conditions or hard seats. Service is exceptional on this airline and staff very nice. Not a lover of airline food but some dishes were very nice but to avoid jetlag we normally only eat very small amounts.","positive"
"10298","Check in was quick and efficient as expected with Singapore Airlines. Lounge access was the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to SQ passengers. Lounge service was excellent, with a good selection of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing. Overall a very good flight","positive"
"10239","Despite some allegations of cost-cutting measures surfacing across the internet and social media, Singapore Airlines is still unequivocally and undeniably the best in its class. In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless. Flying in Singapore Airlines on a premium cabin is truly and quite literally a heavenly experience at 40,000ft in the sky.","positive"

"5857","Awesome flying experience Singapore Airlines... Enjoyed the service... air hostesses are so humble and down to earth... Singapore airlines allowed to choose our seats as well as suitable food through online. Loved the atmosphere... Individual LCD screen display movies, cartoons with different languages... Rest rooms are neat and tidy. Announcements are clear. Toothpaste, tooth brush, socks and blankets are provided. Singapore-Melbourne-Wellington service is started operating four times per week as SQ247 started from 3 May 2018. Return services operated as SQ248 on a Wellington-Melbourne-Singapore routing. Flights are with 266-seat Boeing 777-200s fitted with 38 Business Class seats and 228 Economy Class seats.","positive"
"401","Not what it used to be We have used Singapore Airlines many times as it flies direct out of Adelaide. Our flight over was fine even though the food was truly awful. On our return flight our bag was being transferred from a connecting flight from Vientiane for our flight back to Adelaide. We made it back fine but no luggage. Our bag has not yet been returned even though I have an air tag inside it and I have provided Singapore Airlines with a photo of where the bag is located in Changi Airport. It is so frustrating to know exactly where it is and has been since we landed there and yet still get the standard line...we are still trying to locate your bag. I wonder if any one actually looks? Our positive view of the Airline has collapsed as a result.","negative"

Not only were we able to score some pretty cheap airfare, the service was amazing. The service began at the check-in, where the employees were very respectful and helpful. Once the flight began, they offered hot refreshing towels. During the flight the team members were very receptive to customer requests and they served 2 meals, one right after take-off and one before landing. Free beer and free wine as well.","positive"

"10074","It was actually my first time going to Auckland in a A350. My Sister's TV screen was not working and they immediately fixed it. This is what I call efficiency. When we took off, about half and hour later, the cabin crew started breakfast service. I chose the nasi lemak and orange jucie. Very good! Only downside was that it was supposed to be fried chicken but the chicken was breast meat. But I don't blame them for that. Cabin crew were extremely friendly. Food was very very good too. I definitely enjoyed the flight.","positive"
"6829","Somehow disappointed on the leg Singapore to Auckland , but quite Happy on Singapore to Paris Singapore is supposedly the best airline, We had 2 connecting flight Paris to Singapore and Singapore to Auckland . The set up of the planes are unusual . The service on the first leg was excellent , and on the second leg it was not as good. The food is good but nothing more. . This was a round trip and the the checking on the return ( from Auckland) was poor with a person who hardly spoke English and not sure about what she was doing.","positive"

"9087","Overseas Travel The flight was very nice and considering the time on the plane, the attendants made it quite bearable.

"6226","Stingy Rich Asians-lah We booked award travel tickets using Kris Flyer miles. Afterward we realized there was another flight available for award travel which would be a better fit for our schedule. Within an hour of original booking, we called Singapore Airlines to request that we change the booking to the more convenient flight. Even though only a short time had elapsed, the airline demanded $50 per person change fee. We asked for a supervisor to reconsider, but the supervisor also refused to waive the change fee. This airline offers a good in-flight product, on par with regional rivals EVA and Cathay Pacific. However, when it comes t extracting fees from travelers, they are just as smarmy as any other carrier. Be careful here, if you make a mistake you will pay for it. Lah!","negative"
"9485","Great flight Always like flying with Singapore Airlines. The staff are very nice, and you usually take off on time. This time I found the meal service just a little chaotic, but otherwise nothing to grumble about.

Not sure about those served by the trolley. After everything is cleared, the cabin lights were dim. Time to sleep. Aircon is just of the right temperature. Slept through till about 2 hours before landing, we had breakfast. Warm eggs with vegi sides & buns. Enjoyed the night on the plane.","positive"

"41","Nothing premium about premium economy I booked premium economy as I wanted more leg room and a foot and calf rest. I have a disability and need to be comfortable. Staff were excellent on boarding and I was shown to my seat. Leg room was good and seat seemed comfortable. However there is nothing premium about premium economy. After takeoff we were given a snack, but nothing to drink. I asked if I could have a drink and was advised that drinks would be offered later. Why would I want to eat a snack with nothing to drink. I waited and waited. There was no bottle of water in the seating area which should have been there. After 1 hr and 20 mins finally it looked like drinks were being offered. Juice or water only. Me and my husband were missed out. We thought they would realise so waited patiently. Staff had got to economy when I got up and asked if I could have a drink as we had been missed. After waiting nearly 2hrs we finally got a drink of orange juice. Another round of drinks was offered later again juice/water tea or coffee. After nearly 5 hrs we were again offered juice or water. I asked for wine by that stage as sick of juice. To the staff members credit he got it for me. Dinner was offered with a bottle of water only. Once the trays where cleared about finally the drinks trolley with champagne was offered. My seat did not recline correctly and my TV froze twice. The staff are all lovely but there is nothing premium about premium economy. Not enough staff and very slow service. They clearly do not want to offer more than 1 alcoholic drink on an 8hr flight. The seat eventually reclined with the help of staff and was comfortable. Will never pay the cost for premium economy. As no premium food, service , and dirty toilets. The foot rest is poor and the calf rest only very minimally offers support. Emirates premium economy if far superior.","negative"
"10820","Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.","negative"

"10196","SQ227 in Economy. Booked in April. Fare was Starting at $1600.00USD, luckily I was able to use my mileage for this trip. Gate opened right on time, with Cabin Crew going through Security after me. I boarded last, and was welcomed aboard. Crew made comments on my Attaché, saying ""You look like 007"", and other nice touches. One asked ""I like that! Is that A Rimowa?"" Nice to see SQ crew attentive, with small touches. Cabin jammed, Had to go around to get to my seat. I sat 62G, and had no Overhead Bin. So I had to use another one. Throughout the flight nobody disturbed my stuff. Luckily my Attaché fit under the seat. Also there is only 1 Lavatory in the rear of the Aircraft. We got served a lovely dinner. I noticed one of the Female crew members, was in a Suit. Flying with SQ since 2008, had me pondered. After the meal I engaged her in some conversation. She said ""I am a Flight Auditor. Do you have any Feedback Sir?'. I didn't tell her about the appallingly horrific SQ check in at FRA, but maybe I should have. I settled in to sleep. One of the Cabin Attendants asked me if I wanted an aid to cover my eyes, but I said no, and I flew asleep. Woke up 90 minutes out, and was served refreshment. Multiple coffee rounds commenced, with crew approaching sleeping passengers for Refreshment. Landed MEL, with announcements on Luggage coming out late, however no SQ Ground Staff at the Luggage Carousel. If I go to Australia again, I would definitely fly Singapore Airlines.","positive"
"4085","Disappointed with ground arrangement! We were being informed that flight delayed due to technical issue, without estimate time to resolve. Told them we need to catch next connecting flight but no arrangement being made, just asked us to wait. Fine. What i am disappointed with SQ is that they did not prioritize on travellers with kids, i pity the lady travel alone with his son (around 3-4yrs old) and with language barrier being unattended even though she had attempted the staff numerous times to ask for status, she even video call her husband to speak with the staff but still no staff trying to help her. Next, the person in charge even asked all the staffs to leave the station by leaving all the frustrated passengers unattended (refer to the picture, no staff at the counter). I am really surprised this happened to SQ, one of the best airlines in the world. Disappointed..","negative"
"9598","Long Haul Flight 13hrs Heard many great reports for this airline, but not as I expected on such a long haul flight, only glad I was not sitting in economy.

"605","Damaged luggage Service on the ground and in the air good but planes and seats very dated. Leg room ok but design of seat still old style - legs have to be curved to one side when lying flat. On arrival, one of the wheels of my 4-wheel checked in luggage had fallen off. Didn't have time to report the damage as had another connecting flight to Europe. Took photos and when we got to Europe put in a claim to the airlines. Despite numerous emails (each time received an automated acknowledgment) chasing after the claim and making new claims, nothing has happened. Even rang SIngapore Airlines in Singapore and spoke to customer service. Put in more applications and still nothing. If you look at Singapore Airlines' sites in Australia and SIngapore, they are designed not be contactable. Many of the phone numbers are out dated and ring out. They don't want your opinions. They are not interested in what you think. I had a similar issue with a third rate airline many years ago and had the same issue of no follow up after numerous emails and phone calls. I thought SIA is a first rate and premium airline. Most disappointed. It's just another airline with poor customer service. If this is how they approach customer service, how do they approach airline safety?","negative"

Imagine someone says to you, have yourself a duvet day, don’t worry about what to eat or drink, we’ll bring you anything you want to drink including champagne and some lovely food at well placed intervals. iPad charger, vanity light to top up your make-up is at hand as is the remote to watch films, tv programmes you may have missed or listen to music. Adjust your reclining chair into a bed when you want to sleep and snuggle up in your duvet. The delightful and exceptionally efficient staff will see to your every need as though you’re a vip and then when you finally reach your destination they bid you farewell as though you’re a personal friend. What’s not to love about this first class airline.","positive"
"11240","Wonderful service, hot towel and welcome drink for every passenger. In flight system is ok, new movie and TV series. Food is good, I had three choices of main course.

Wi-Fi is available, but very expensive.","positive"
"1160","No enough food served in long flights Over an 8 hour flight, food served once within a couple of hours of taking off and then nothing at all. In the past, I was never hungry after arriving in Singapore airport in the past but this time was very different. Arrived around 10 pm and needed to eat dinner. Airlines did not serve dinner, and no good restaurant or café is around in Singapore airport. I had 22 hours transit and desperately needed to eat good food but nothing is available in Singapore airport. By the way, paid twice as much for the tickets, was hungry on the plane and could not purchase any decent food in the airport. Never again with Singapore airlines and never go via Singapore airlines if there is a long transit.","neutral"
"189","Good service I was very happy with this airlines for my honeymoon. We left shortly after the passengers were loaded meaning we got off the ground ahead of schedule and landed ahead of schedule.

The crew was very friendly and helpful.","positive"
"738","Bad customer service/ good inflight service I have a mixed review for SIA. The inflight service was excellent and the staff on the both to and from Kuala Lumpur were excellent. However, the customer service in Changi is terrible. Our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore was delayed by 50 minutes and SIA had changed their schedule, so we had a 10 hour stop-over at Changi. Our request for a meal vopucher or the use of a lougnge was refused. Apparently SIA no longer provides meal vouchers. This came as a bit of a shock to us as we have been flying with SIA since 2008, sans the Covid years, and they were well known for their customer service then. Not anymore.","negative"

It’s a nearly flawless, well-priced, high-quality offering, from the personalized greetings, through the expertly designed space with ample privacy (even technically without a complete enclosure), to the hard-working, well-presented attendants who don’t look like someone’s grandma (many US airlines should really learn from this) One would only wish they offer more 5th-freedom routes like this that connect the US and Europe.","positive"
"10689","Bangkok to Singapore. Among all the times I have flown with Singapore Airlines, this trip did not feel like Singapore Airlines at all. Firstly, there was a slight delay and the ground staff did not provide any information whatsoever. A bad start to the journey. After boarding the plane, I could feel that the cabin crew lacked warmth and hospitality. Shortly after takeoff, the cabin crew came round to serve the children first. They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn’t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy! When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked ‘stew or chicken rice?’. They didn’t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the ‘superior quality’ Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that. Disappointed with Singapore Airlines this time round. The only good point of this trip was that we could fly in their new Boeing 787-10 with improved amenities. But other than that, this flight could not be recognised as from Singapore Airlines!","negative"
"108","Comfortable Flight Pleasant flight for both of us seated in 46D & 46E. All efficient and friendly at check-in which helped us oldies understand new systems in use. Efficient boarding and on time departure. Well informed during flight. Enjoyed our meal and drinks. Very good selection of movies and music. WIFI available. All good.","positive"
"3063","Cramped Seat What a difference to our previous flight. We were seated in 44H and J on the B787. Now I'm on the larger size and I cannot recall ever experiencing such cramped seating on a flight. Legroom was not a problem but the space between seats was. I could not fully deploy the table for the meal service, a half table had to suffice. When the passenger in front reclined the seat, it was very uncomfortable. We did enjoy the services of an excellent cabin crew, a delicious meal served, quality amenity kits distributed, and juices/soft drinks/water served at regular intervals. Felt safe throughout the flight although there was heavy turbulence on occasions.","positive"
"4718","Outstanding customer service!!! Singapore Airlines certainly know how to do customer service and I felt looked after from start to finish. Hot towels, snacks and decent food made this one of my more memorable flights of recent years and is now an airline I will definitely use again and recommend to friends. Singapore Airlines well done on a great job!!!","positive"
"6815","World's best airline... sometimes, depending on where you are going! It really depends on where you're going. No complaints on the European sectors of our trip - the planes were new and clean and everything was great, definitely a great experience. The Australian sectors however seemed neglected. The planes were old with a grubby, tired interior, uncomfortable seats, outdated IFE technology (no touch screens... on the world's best airline... in 2019!?), and even the food was noticeably worse on these sectors. It's also the only full-service airline I've flown that doesn't serve dinner at the beginning of an overnight flight to Australia - there was only a small greasy pizza snack, making it seem very ""budget airline"". Boarding was efficient except in Sydney. The staff were great on all flights, always friendly and helpful. The drinks services between meals were few and far between however and some flights didn't have them at all, which is another thing many other airlines handle much better.","neutral"

"8425","OLD FRIEND Revisited Been awhile since we flew SIA and our entire family decided to fly it when we went for our holidays, Everything went well from the time we arrived at the airport counter until we boarded our taxi at Changi. Service was courteous, efficient and seamless that other than our grandson's ears popping upon ascent and descent of the plane, we had another pleasant trip. The only thing we noticed was the quality of the catering has diminished. Thanks to everyone who served us.","positive"
"10147","Booked a wheelchair service from Milan to Bangkok. Apart from a slight mishap in Singapore this was one of the best flights I have ever had. The quality of the service was outstanding. Crew worked throughout unlike many European airlines, with great attentiveness. I know because I never sleep. The quality of the food was superb. From my experience both Singapore airlines and Thai have the best training I have come across. Very good entertainment system with many choices. As a yearly flyer there is nothing better than having a long flight where everything works smoothly and people care about you. I can only say thank you. I appreciate your hard work. I will be flying with you again later this year.","positive"
"10997","London to Singapore return, and the Premium Economy experience was very poor. Despite booking some months in advance, they neglected to allocate us any seats together and our party of 4 was distributed throughout the cabin. The seat configuration is 2-4-2 and there are no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. Rather than a separate cabin curtained off, Premium Economy is just the front section of the economy section. The seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than Air NZ. The food was terrible. We used the ""book the cook"" option on the return flight and this was no better, though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group. The staff were unfriendly and snacks on the 14 hour flight (2 meals were offered, the second 6 hours before arrival) had to be requested via the call button. The flight arrived early and the plane was quite new but would not fly Singapore Airlines again long haul.","negative"
"10175","I am submitting this review about a terrible experience with Singapore Airlines wherein my family were subject to a 5-hour delay which then caused them to miss their connecting flight and extend the delay to 30+ hours. The delay according to Singapore Airlines was caused by traffic control between Guangzhou and Singapore and the plane had to be diverted to Kuala Lumpur to refuel for more than 2 hours on the tarmac. We missed the connecting flight SQ38 on August 9th to LAX as a result. We were placed in a hotel by SQ adjacent to the airport for a sudden 24hour plus layover near midnight with a ""food coupon"" that we had to fight for as we were starving due to the long delay and no food service on the plane. After arriving at the hotel we found out that those food vouchers were not even valid according to the hotel, Capri by Fraser, and no food service was available. Capri by Fraser's on duty manager in Singapore apparently said they don't take ""food coupons"" from Singapore Airlines for emergency layover guests and that this was a miscommunication with SQ. At near midnight where nearly all restaurants were closed and Capri is far from the city center, how were we expected to get a meal after being misled by Singapore Airline staff at the airport about the availability of food and their miscommunication? What if we were first time guests in Singapore with no knowledge of the local language and not able to navigate the situation? This is a complete failure from a management perspective as logically delayed passengers who miss a connecting flights after a certain time should at least be informed properly if not put in a hotel with 24 room service/dining options in or nearby and given the courtesy of not having to worry about starving on top of rearranging travel plans etc. For an airline with a world class reputation where one pays a premium for the service this just is not acceptable. I submitted a complaint to Singapore Airlines but their complains team threw a response back at me: “as much as we acknowledge the inconvenience you went through as a result of the delay, as an industry practice, and in line with our Conditions of Contract and Carriage, we would like to share that airlines generally do not compensate for consequential losses or inconvenience arising from flight delays.” However, I know international passenger rights stemming from Article 19 of the Montreal Convention. When I brought this up to an SQ customer service supervisor after spending hours on call trying to reach someone who I could speak to about this, I was shocked and concerned to find out that not even supervisor level reps knew about one of the most important international passenger rights conventions. SQ repeatedly mislead and misrepresent int'l passenger rights trying to brush me off. Currently they have ceased responding to my emails and appears to think that ignoring the issue will fix it. I don't know what more I can do at this point but I hope this review will serve to shed light on the holes in SQ's 5 star service and World's Best Airline reputation. I hope no one has to experience what we experienced during that disastrous layover in Singapore.","negative"
"8009","Very Disappointing We flew from Melbourne to Singapore Business Class on SQ218 which was and A380. Very disappointing, when you book and pay for business class you expect a certain level of comfort and service. It all started at the Lounge in Melbourne - small and very average food and amenities compared to what is on offer in Singapore The plane was old and tired. My seat didn't work to recline properly. The food was very average and so was the service. The flight itself was good with not too much turbulence. The in flight movie selection had very few new releases","negative"

"1951","PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE We have travelled many times to Singapore over the years and always with Singapore Airlines. In September 2019 we had the pleasure of travelling Perth/Singapore/HoChiMinh and SiemReap/Singapore/Perth Business Class and it was everything we could have wanted. Our flights and lounge visits exceeded our expectations and we have again booked Singapore Airlines for May 2020. We received the most amazing customer service from every staff member but the highest credit must go to Patricia of the Singapore Airlines Business Class Lounge in Singapore. Patricia observed that my husband was unwell and a little concerned about the distance from lounge to gate. She used her initiative and went above and beyond by arranging transport for us, and kept us fully informed which was greatly appreciated. Patricia has definitely made an impression on us and we hope to see her again in May.","positive"

"6321","This has good reviews and they are well deserved! We were so fed up with substandard travel we decided to try Singapore Airlines even though it meant travelling to Manchester. Incredibly it was cheaper even after paying train fares and one night in an hotel! The booking system was easy and straightforward, the checking in on line the same, and choice of seats was so easy for us. Once we got to handin in our luggage the staff again were so helpful and made the suggestion to change our seat so we would have three seats to use for the two of us. Passing through security and into the departures was a cinch, We were welcomed on to the aircraft by beautifully turned out crew, who were so welcoming and helpful. The plane was clean and smart, the entertainment system easy to manage. We were offered water/orange juice so regularly throughout the trip, and the food was glorious, a choice between European and eastern. Nothing was too much trouble and they remembered everything they said they would do. I can't recommend them enough, and will be flying with them in the future, wherever possible.","positive"

Such a shame and waste of money that people just don’t have to throw away. And all for what? To line your pockets some more.","negative"
"3138","Worst airline I traveled with this airline numerous times and I have never had good service. They are expensive, the luggage allowance is less than other airlines and the food is horrible. On one flight the staff didn't even serve me food. I was a breasfeeding mother at that point which also meant my baby had less to drink that day. When I spoke to customer care they played it off as me being fussy over the food and dismissed my email. Hard to be fussy if you arent even served. The check in staff is rude and don't seem to know what they are doing. When I asked the flight attendant for warm water to feed my baby I waited 15min and she returned with unwashed bottle and ice cold water. Everything seems to be to much effort for them. I am so tired of flying with an airline that treat you like they are doing you a favor. They seem to forget that their customers pay to be on their airplanes. Avoid them if possible.","negative"

"7404","Istanbul to Singapore: SQ391 Cashed in some SQ points to travel in business class back to Singapore from Istanbul. Operated by a B777-200ER but still quite comfortable. Food and service were both very good. Perhaps I enjoyed it all the more as this year I've been taking a lot of flights operated by Budget airlines. Arrived 15 mins early. Only negative was the lounge at Ataturk airport which resembled a zoo - far too many people crowded into the Turkish Airlines lounge. One can only hope that things improve once services are moved to the new airport. Otherwise no complaints.","positive"
"7845","Whats-not-to-love ? SQ, everybody loves Flew on SQ21/ 22 EWR-SIN, long-haul 18 flight-hours. I can't say if I like it better than flight with layover. During transit, at least I can do ""my business"" and stretch out a bit, since I am only flying Premium, not Business- bit time to stretch is definitely help. And if you're claustrophobic, that layover might help a bit? But on the pros- you get to your destination 2 hours faster. But other than that... SQ non-stop service vs. with transit, same quality, superb service as always. Price-point of this P-Econ is good value for the money. And the hours are good. I'm from Indiana, so I can catch early flight to EWR and catch the flight in the AM. Arrived in SIN early AM then continue on with the journey. Return trip was also good. Arrived in EWR in the afternoon, plenty of connecting flight to take me back to IND. Service was exceptional, as always. Meals and snacks were meh. Entertainment choices were awesome. So all in all, good flight. After towel service, was served meal as soon as we took off. Throughout the flight, we offered drinks and refreshments. Second meal happened about 11 hours in. Then provided boxed-snack before landing. That last bites could be better. Felt that 7-11 snacks were actually better. I know... what can you expect from airplane meal. But then again, on flights with layover, from US to SEA, we get 4 full-meals total. We should get at least 3 full service, right. But that's okay. SQ is still one of my fave. Recommend it to everybody!","positive"

When I told them I wasn't going to make it, they changed my flight without charge. In San Francisco, they went to great lengths to help me with my ESA dog and seating. Ended up with whole back row to myself and Rousey. Flight attendants during flight were very helpful. Would recommend for anyone needing to travel with animals.","positive"
"3899","Great airline We flew to and from Bali with Singapore airlines flying from Tokyo/Japan! It was so nice getting the hot towels to freshen up and the meals were delicious and very filling! On our way to Bali the flight from Singapore to Bali was short and sharp the flight attendant was rushing we felt sorry for her! Then on our way home we got the partner airline silk air to Singapore this was a little disappointing as there wasn’t any entertainment but it was a short flight so that was okay. The flight was delayed I think due to Bali airport but the airline gave us a little food voucher to use in the airport at Singapore while we waited for our new flight that was rescheduled (3 hours was all we were behind so not bad) and then from Singapore to Tokyo was amazing the best plane we had been on! It had nice TVs with very recent movies and it was a great experience to finish our holiday on! The options of food were amazing again and the flight attendant was so kind he gave us a few fizzy drinks and topped us up rather then just 1 cup like some airlines! Would definitely recommend Singapore airlines to people! Thanks so much for the great experience!","positive"
"1360","Excellent service, especially good for the disabled We’d flown to Singapore on Thai Airways, but decided to use Singapore Airline for the return, to avoid a long wait in Bangkok (Thai cancelled a good connecting flight). We were much happier with the precautions against Covid-19 in Singapore compared to Thailand. The flight was very comfortable, and we had adequate space in our seats. There was plenty of TV entertainment, but the earphones were cheap and nasty (not as good as on Thai). There were adequate toilets, and we didn’t have to queue for more than a minute or two. I do wish airlines would state the number of passengers per toilet. I’m disabled and this is very important for me. When I checked the seating plan, I thought there were inadequate toilets, but there were more toilets than the seating plan showed! Toilets and the whole plane were very clean throughout the trip. It was a night flight, and we were offered drinks when we were awake on many occasions. The food was tasty, with a choice of Western or Eastern meals. The plane was modern. After using Thai Airways, I was very impressed with the standard of care I received as a disabled person. We were greeted when we entered the plane, and escorted to our seats, the stewardess carried our cabin baggage for us, and stowed it in the overhead locker. Before landing, she came to our seats and explained the procedure (we stay seated until other passengers have left the plane). She then came when the plane had emptied, collected our baggage and escorted us to the exit. We’ve flown with Singapore Airlines repeatedly, and once again felt we had an excellent flight.","positive"

My transmitter that enables my wireless headphones to connect, doesn't always work on left and right. No problems on this flight. Power outlets for mains and USB. The best boarding process I have used, why don't all airlines do this? After showing boarding pass and entering the gate lounge, we were seated in boarding groups. Then each seated are group was called up in turn. Much more efficient than calling out the number of the boarding group and hoping every one has heard and no one tries to queue jump.","positive"

I then hear over a loud speaker my friends name and then mine , to go to baggage services and I then had my doubts confirmed by a member of staff that our bags had not left Frankfurt to make the connection to Singapore then Brisbane . I started to panic as I had medical stuff in the bag that I desperately needed and no matter how I tried to explain my situation . all I was told my bags would hopefully arrive the next day , I was told to make a complaint to the first Airline I was on Lufthansa , then Singapore , but no real comfort was ever given or I felt from any of the Airlines, it was a case of no bags made there connecting fights .

They will send an email to your spam folder, tell you that you didn't see it and it isn't their problem. Horrible company will never deal with them again.","negative"
"9810","Premium Economy 13 hour flight First time I used the Premium Economy class on Singapore Airlines, chosen due to the long flight and me being not well suited to the small economy class seats for such a long flight. The seats are a luxury compared to the economy class seats but still far from business class. As the trays are not mounted to the seat in front you could remain reclined whilst food is served and could remain asleep in requested. Good leg room and the seats reclined back more than economy. Bigger tv screen and you get your own arm rests so no need to struggle with your neighbours. I upgraded to premium economy from economy class. My employer allows me to claim back economy flight tickets so I only personally paid the cost of the upgrade. For short flights of less than 6 hours I personally wouldn't bother to upgrade but the long flight made a world of difference. It's by no means anywhere near a business class flight experience but better than economy. Just depends if you feel you can justify the extra approximatley 30% higher price.","positive"

Now asking for refund, it just reply me with check and get back to me, after 2 weeks still no reply yet","negative"

"7249","Spoilt Now I've flown Business Class on other airlines and have been reasonably satisfied, however I'm afraid Singapore Airline is a different class, no wonder their always up there in the ratings year on year. The only problem? Next flight I'll know that I'll be disappointed as I'll be comparing it with this airline.","positive"
"10151","Flew on A52 from Singapore to Manchester on the 10 January. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent in providing outstanding service.

Very highly recommended.","positive"
"9093","BEST Airline in the world - Everytime again I have flewn many times already with Singapore Airlines and I don't have made any negative experience so far. The cabin crew are making their outmost to give you an enjoyable flight, no matter the class you booked into. The food is everytime very delicious, which you can't say often from other Airlines. The uniforms of the cabin crew is very stylish and sexy and they even sell this uniform design on different merchendise (Bags, Books etc.) Entertainment is very well choosen and there is a huge range of movies, music and games. Seating rows got enough space inbetween especially when flying the A380. I would fly Singapore Airlines everytime again.","positive"
"2248","A cut above the rest... We recently went to New Zealand and travelled from the UK going west throughout, with the leg from Auckland - Singapore being with Singapore Airlines (the other three legs being with Air New Zealand, see separate review), as the two airlines share this route. We were in Premium Economy (due to a deal from our travel agents - Trailfinders), and the extra cost involved was money well spent in terms of space, entertainment, service, food and drink and general ambience. I've rated it 5 out of 5, but Singapore does not quite measure up to Air New Zealand in my book, and with the choice of more ratings I'd go for 9 out of 10 - don't misunderstand me, it's still very, very good and thoroughly recommended.","positive"

"10055","Outstanding service from the cabin crew, who made passengers feel welcome with every interaction throughout the flight. They have been very well trained in hospitality. Food and beverages were plentiful and tasty, and passengers were free to get snacks from the galley (even in economy class) in between the 2 main meals served. The range of options for movies was impressive. I would go out of my way to choose this airline in the future, even if it meant paying more compared to a competitor.","positive"

The service on the airline was great meals were good, service was great. The staff were friendly and professional as always. My cabin crew attendant was friendly and professional at all times. She had no issues with any of queries or request for food and drinks. She was also happy to have a photo taken with me too. I would recommend this airline company to everyone.","positive"

"7344","Full flight, yet not bad experience I had travelled with Singapore Airlines business class before and this time on economy they still did not disappoint.

"5426","Pleasant flight - Comfortable We were boarded efficiently onto the Airbus. However, the seats that we paid extra for, were not as we saw in the original seat map. The flight was not full. We brought the seat issue to a member of the cabin crew. She took our boarding cards and then a male cabin crew approached us. He offered us seats at the very back of the plane. Totally unsuitable and worse than our current seats. However, another female member smartly diffused the situation with a move to bulkhead seats. I think her name was Audrey (I think). She was professional and efficient. No don't get me wrong. We were not being awkward. We had ten flights to take over a three weeks with a four year old child and our seats were chosen with that in mind. Anyway, the plane got away five minutes early and arrived 11 minutes early in Shanghai. The flight was comfortable. The cabin crew were courteous and the food was good.","positive"

Arriving at Changi, we were carted off to catch our flight and was told our luggages would unlikely be on board but would arrive at a later flight. At our destination, we went to the luggage counter to explain our situation and we were asked to fill a form and a compensation of $120 US were provided for the inconvenience. Our luggages arrived few hours later at our hotel. How awesome is that!","positive"
"3090","Not enough water Great flight. Staff, friendly. the food was good can't really complain. My tip is take some water on board as is gets dry in the cabin. i asked for some socks which they provided thank goodness as it gets cold flying at night. Wear noisecancelling headphones for crying babies and snoring passengers.","positive"
"11137","Hong Kong to Auckland via Singapore. Hong Kong to Singapore final call was made 30min before departure time but flight departed 1hr late to schedule. Crew were nice and helpful. IFE system was user friendly and had a large screen, flight map didn't work when landing. Movies were available in different language subtitles but more different types of movies could be included. Meal was delicious with decent amount. Paper menu was distributed before meal. Flight landed in Singapore 45min late which made our transit time a bit tight. Next flight was the same plane. Crew were polite and helpful. Hot towels were distributed. Legroom was decent with a footrest. Amenity kit was distributed. Two meals were tasty. Drinks and sandwiches were given between meals. Flight arrived in Auckland 5 min early. Singapore Airlines is worth it's 5-Star rating.","positive"
"5263","My first ever flight is INTERNATIONAL flight!! It's my first ever flight and I was so very grateful that it is INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT and I am going to a very famous country which is SINGAPORE. I always watched videos in YouTube what to do when you entered ""airport"" and what to do when you ride in a ""plane"". But I think you don't need to watch anything because every airlines have their own video to teach all of us what to do when riding in a plane and all we need for our safety. SQ will give you so much satisfaction when it comes to your flight. They will help you throughout the flight, they will give you what you need and also they are so very approachable so you will not get shy when you talk to them. My first check-in and for the baggage I don't know what to do but they assist me. I feel so comfortable in my seat even though I am not sitting beside window. And also the food in the plane is good. If you're traveling and you will go to Singapore, you must choose SINGAPORE AIRLINES. If you are first timer like me you must choose it more because you will love your first flight when you choose SQ for sure. Maybe soon I will travel more but SINGAPORE AIRLINES is the best so far!!","positive"
"11115","Sydney to Milan via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. A waste of money! Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline. I take 3-4 long haul trips between Australia and Europe per year and will never fly Singapore Airlines again!","negative"
"7084","The best cattle class Singapore Airlines flies with the modern Airbus A350-900 between Amsterdam and Singapore. These aircraft are brand new, consequently in good repair and offer a spacious impression. But it is still cattle class, so the seats are cramped and the aisles narrow with the 9 in a row layout. However, the friendly cabin crew, a trade mark of SIA, the extensive entertainment possibilities with the large screens in the back of the seats and the palatable food (palatable for airline standards) are the positive points. Singapore Airlines is to be recommended, even for the cattle class on a 12 hours flight.","positive"
"6143","Comfort and entertainment in SQ’s new B787-10 Flying economy on the new B787-10 from SIN to BKK was really great! The seat is wide, foot length is pretty good and the entertainment option is one if the best. The TV screen is easily 19 inch! The head rest is adjustable as well so it can slide up and down to fit your head whether you are tall or short. There’s a small insert underneath the Tv screen where you can place your smartphone in while you are charging or maybe texting on it with the onboard wifi.","positive"

We were scheduled to take off 7.55pm but due to late passengers, were only wheels up at 8.20pm. Still landed punctually at 11.55pm. Great entertainment, ok food but class service even in economy. Love all treated well regardless of sex or race. Kudos SIA!","positive"
"8490","Comfortable flight Excellent service. Great food menu. Friendly staff all the way. It certainly makes a huge difference on such a long flight. We were fortunate in being upgraded from premium economy into business class for both legs of the trip. Being able to stretch out makes a long journey far more bearable.","positive"
"8770","The best AIRLINE till now I have been flying with Singapore airline since I was a little girl. . Their aircraft well maintain and always replace their aircraft earlier than any other airline that I have been flying with. All their crews are well groomed and polished , speaks multiple languages. You do not see any sour face or attitude come from them even though they have been serving you in a long flight. During night time, in one incident a child was screaming, they were gentle to let the parent know to get control and help them as they can to make the child to settle down. ( the last thing we need on the long flight crying and screaming, I have daughter that started travelling since she was 2 years old that I would make sure that she was quite). There is an airline that the crews just let the children running up and down during the night time, very inconsiderate to other passengers. This airline is the compatotor of the Singapore Airline. Their aircrafts also considering luxurious but STILL far from Singapore Airline in service.Singapore Airline invest well on their Crews educations, even if you seat at economy class. This is your hard earned money and you deserve courtesy as you give them a business regardless which class you seat. Just think , if nobody seat in the economy the airline will not survive.","positive"
"6809","Long haul flight, Istanbul to Brisbane and return Have used Singapore Airlines on a number of occasions to fly to Australia, good service all round from check in to arrival. On board service excellent, cabin layout much better than similar airlines. Food and drinks service and selection well above average. Singapore Airlines also offer stopover breaks of varying lengths in Singapore which are excellent value for money, had a six night break on last trip, absolutely first class experience.","positive"
"329","Great service; not so great comfort Service was impeccable: my wife had hurt her knee not long before we flew and found walking any distance difficult. Before we even reached the check-in/baggage-drop desk, SIA had offered to get her assistance. This carried her right to the plane's door - where a squad of stewardesses positively fought over who would help her onto the plane itself. And then the same on arrival. Outstanding customer care. Food was good. Music choice was not quite as wide as I expected but ok: the headphones were good. (Can't comment on film choices.) Business flat bed - well, it's true that it lies flat, but you end up lying diagonally and your feet are in a little cubby-hole. I had several bouts of cramp and can't describe it as comfortable, although admittedly this 777 was better than the A380 on the return flight, which was just simply uncomfortable - far too firm, as a seat and a bed.","positive"
"884","Sneakily booking people on Scoot I'm so angry, Singapore Airlines used to be good, but when booking a ticket to Vietnam, they sneakily put you on Scoot - for an 8 hour flight! I paid for a full price, full service ticket - they clearly must have put operated by Scoot in very small writing somewhere, to say I'm upset is an understatement. I could have booked a Scoot ticket for $200, not the $800 I paid to not have to sit for 8 hours on a horrible plane. My whole trip is ruined, I've been having a really hard time and now I'm stuck on what is going to be a miserable flight. To cancel costs half the ticket price. The same has happened for my return leg! Shame on you Singapore Airlines, this is the last time I will ever book with such an unethical and untrustworthy company! Thank you for ruining my first holiday in years!","negative"
"9238","Honeymoon and not a drop of gin to be had! We didn’t go solely for the gin! But it would’ve been nice to have had the choice... Honeymoon trip to Australia - we were so looking forward to the flight (especially as Singapore Airlines has such a good reputation) as it marked the start of a two month tour. Soon after take off we asked for a pre-lunch gin and tonic but were to there was no gin on board! Unbelievable! They offered us a tiny plastic glass of warm sparkling wine and a celebration cake, which wasn’t at all what we wanted. We found it disappointing. The staff seemed stretched and stressed, and the service was not as good as we expected (and we are undemanding travellers) We felt we were being penalised for travelling economy","neutral"
"8602","Singapore airlines I fly to Singapore every year and also use their associated airline SilkAir for any onward flights needed. I always book directly with the airline and early booking produces very good prices. The aircraft are always well presented both in cleanliness, facilities and aircrew.

There was blood on my olive-green jeans that was very obvious. The staff of the flight gave me a dress to put on and then proceeded to clean the blood off my jeans. They did and then gave them back just as it was time to start preparing for landing. Who on earth would do this? The flight attendants were just so lovely and discreet. i cannot commend them enough for this as I had another 5-hour flight to go in my journey. Thank you ever so much Singapore Airlines, I highly recommend this airline for travel, economy was still very comfortable and we did no go hungry.","positive"

"6161","First time We chose Singapore because it had the friendliest flight times. It was a flight of two halves, SQ51 Manchester to Singapore was great with good service and good food. SQ245 Singapore to Brisbane was rather chaotic with haphazard service and yukky dried up food. How does that happen with the sane airline? Both planes were relatively new, very spacious and comfy.","positive"
"733","Nowhere near the calibre it used to be We have flown SIA in Economy for years and years. The friendly service and great food is what always brought us back. On our most recent flight on 31 August 2022 from Brisbane to Singapore it was so different. The staff were surly and had a particularly poor attitude towards caucasions. They were friendly enough towards their fellow Asians. We have never experienced this before on any airline, but found this particularly surprising in an airline like SIA. We did a further flight in early September in Premium Economy from Singapore to London - see separate review. Lift your game SIA. We won't be back. We did not feel welcome.","negative"
"211","Mediocre service in Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines Oh how the Premium Economy (PE) service has dropped on Singapore Airlines (SA) - not good compared to other PE serviced airlines. In PE you pay extra (a lot extra) this normally includes individual welcoming, a hot towelette and in many cases a drink prior to takeoff. None of this on SA it was an extraordinary amount clutter and confusion through out the PE cabin. One alcohol drink prior to meal service with there wine pours being half a small plastic glass , no offered alcohol drink at meal service, meals through ""Book the Cook"" were not good at all but oh offered plenty of glasses of water throughout trip. Come on SA what has happened to your past extraordinary service that was legendary. Folks if you choose to have a little more comfort and service, choose another airline as Singapore Air has chosen to be a just another mediocre airline.","negative"

The embarking process is interesting as I thought it would ease settling in. However, I had a window seat but found people already occupying isle seats. When flying long haul its always important to wear comfortable shoes and clothes and keep warm. If you don't have the airline provides slippers and socks on request as well as blankets and pillows. They also have tooth brush for those who don't have in their carry-on luggage. Water is always avail for the dry throat.","positive"

Fantastic experience to check-in your luggage early through the Jewel and you can enjoy spending time inside The Jewel. Again, the baggage claim is quick and seamless. The seat is tight like all economy flight.

"731","first time but not the last First time flying Singapore Airlines. The plane was an Airbus; good leg room in Economy seating; the free headphones were much better than the ones on other airlines. Entertainment selection was good - listened to a BB King album, then George Michael. Didn't watch any movies because it was a short flight, but there was a pretty good choice in different genres.s The lunch was tasty - rice with ginger pork and chocolate ice cream for dessert. Gate and cabin crews friendly and efficient.","positive"

I first used them two years ago when I went UK - Auckland return and at that time I could not fault them in anyway this time my experience was different. The food was awful I'm not a person that's fussy about food but every meal was awful. The staff as always were great but you have to ask for everything now that's not standard such as a beer! Don't get me wrong they will get you one but you have to ask before they would ask you. The pillows were dirty god knows with what but you wouldn't put your head on one. I cant put my finger on it but the planes all four were tired. Maybe just a case that they are cutting back the same as everyone else but to me there's no excuse for such poor meals. 3 of us travelled and all of us thought the same.","positive"

"378","Singapore airlines poor communication being trying to get a refund/credit for an unused flight for over a year! I can see from the reviews that Singapore airlines is not what it used to be in terms of customer service and communication they are atrocious! been trying to get a refund for over a year since March 2022. 1st of all they changed my flight so I said i can not use that flight tried several times on the website to comminicate about it and it was so difficult and response times up to 15 days! finally I had to go to Jakarta to a Singapore airlines office to speak to someone. They acknowledged and accepted my claim but said I can just call to make a new flight resevation at a later date. During that time trying to speak to someone over the phone was impossible. Huge wait times I mean over an hour. I gave up. This year I requested a refund and I received an email saying I would get the refund within 6 weeks? this is after a year had gone by. Still waiting for the refund 6 weeks late no confirmation it had been refunded. I wrote again notifying the airline my email address had changed which I did through the Singapore airlines FF portal on the website. you have to go through a security text message to verify its you to do this. Then I get another email saying they need to verify who I am and I need to send all the information again. OMG sooo Frustrating! Still waiting! I am wrting this review because of my frustration. I will not use this airline agian and want to warn others about my experience. This was business class flight & I am a Gold star alliance member. This is totally unacceptable as an airline and if there is a consumer complaints portal in Singapore I would love to know who to submit my complaint to about Singapore airlines.","negative"
"8170","Wonderful Flight to Singapore Very quickly the aircraft was loaded and we were taking off before we knew it. Very efficient number loading made this easy and no fuss. We were only in the air a few minutes when the hostess bought us a lovely warm face washer to refresh us. Then we had constant attention with meals and snacks with any drinks we fancied. We arrived into Singapore after a 10 hour flight feeling refreshed. The best flight we have ever had. Thank you.","positive"
"9547","Good flight - shame about the check-in We had booked this flight through Air New Zealand many months prior, because of the excellent price. Three of the four legs on a round trip from Auckland NZ to London LHR were with Singapore Airlines. Unfortunately this meant we were unable to select our seats on any of the SA flights. One leg I was in a separate cabin from my husband (Some might say this was a good thing!). However, the check-in at Heathrow on the way home was a nightmare. We initially tried to go to a manned check-in desk but were told by attendants to check in at the self-service kiosks. This was a complete failure as the system simply kept asking us for our passports, regardless of how many times we scanned them. Eventually we gave up and went back to the attendants who reluctantly sent us to stand in the (by now) enormous queue. The queue was encompassing passengers for all the Star Alliance airlines (at least 6 others), and we shuffled along for nearly an hour before finally reaching a lovely lady at the check-in desk who explained that the kiosks for Singapore Airlines do not accept Air New Zealand bookings - but nobody else seemed to be aware of that fact. The rest of the flight - seats (together, thanks to the nice lady), food, drinks, comfort etc - were all fine, but the check-in experience left a nasty taste in the mouth, and we will probably not be flying SA again. Baggage claim was also less than perfect: one bag came through quickly but the other took another 20 minutes to arrive. Always a gamble, but disappointing at the end of 27 hours long haul.","neutral"

"2562","No hassle flight. Both legs were hassle free. The slightly more generous pitch gives enough room to be comfortable and although I can't sleep on planes I did manage to doze. This trip I broke the flight with a night layover in Singapore and a good night s sleep made a world of difference at the other end, suffering merely a body clock issue not being over tired. The cabin staff are always friendly and helpful and the food is ok (you don't expect luxury in economy) which is fine as I am not flying for the food! The film selection was not great but the number of to series has increased so I found enough to watch.","positive"
"6599","Service During the flight from Zurich to Singapore, we had already cancelled our selection of seafood for our meals on board. This was because during the flight from Singapore to Zurich, we ate the seafood meals and was not really to our liking. So we decided to select from the menu during our return flight. During the meal time, to our horrors, the service crews just passed us and continue serving the guests. I thought what had happened as people are getting the food but not us. I finally asked the steward why are we not served? He was shock that they have missed us during the serving and apologised profusely. He asked us what we want to eat and we told him any food is fine except no seafood. To our horrors, he mentioned there are only seafood left and do we mind taking it. I told him why we do not want anymore seafood. He mentioned he will check and see what can be done. After a few minutes a stewardess came back and apologised and asked us to take the seafood. I told her that we specifically don’t want seafood meals and would have got the other choice if they have not missed us during the serving of meals. She said she will check what can be done. After a few minutes, a senior Stewardess came and enquire on the issue again. She said she will see to it and left. She came back with a plate of mutton stew with rice for me and a plate of pork chop and rice for my Wife. I believe it’s from the other class. She apologised for the lapsed. I would have been very angry if they would force me to accept the seafood. Luckily the senior Stewardess resolved the issue. I am not happy with the chances to get me to accept what they have left which in the first place they should not have missed us out. At the end, I could say besides this issue, the flight and service was fantastic. They handled it professionally even though the lapsed should not have happened, being a reputable airline. I have been using Singapore Airline for a Long time and in fact have already confirmed my flight to Perth in May and Bangkok in August with them. I will still recommend to fly with them.","positive"

"9963","Now a lost airline I had traveled on Singapore airlines for my honeymoon for my first visit to Singapore and had a fab experience With the same hope I travelled Singapore airlines this time with my wife and kids Service has gone bad Courtesy extinct Smile is there but forced Service in flight pathetic is the word did not even serve a cup of tea don’t know why Cleanliness of the seats average as if the seat covers have not been changed for last so many years All in all disappointed as I had traveled twice before on the same airlines with better experiences Think they are going the cheap way cost cutting 😓😓loosing the charm","negative"
"5612","Great staff, good food and drinks At the gate before boarding started, I asked about upgrades. Decided it was not worth the money. But, they did move me to an exit row (I had not asked for that, but glad that they did) in coach so that I would have extra leg room for the 13 hour flight. During the flight, I asked if I could try a Singapore Sling (never had one before). So, they made me one to try. The two meals were average airline food. However, I was surprised that one could get extra food (snacks) at almost anytime.","positive"
"7385","Disappointing business class Very disappointed as expensive compared to other airlines. No champagne offered had to ask every time also no toiletries bag and told “no we don’t have them” with no offer of anything - even an eye mask! Simply not acceptable for business class. Also no dedicated business class queue in Singapore stood at the end of economy. Really did not feel worth the money at all. Could not care less attitude by staff. Strange seat configuration had to sit diagonally. Old and shabby between Singapore and Perth.","negative"
"7285","Singapore Airlines - The Only Way to fly To Singapore. We had seats 51J & 51K, to be honest, I would buy Premium Economy when next we fly. Food was good & although they ran out of one meal that I preferred, they gave me one from another area which was appreciated. Staff were great & the entertainment of variety of movies, music etc. was very good. We have flown Singapore Airlines to Singapore a number of times & like their service plus on long haul flights a stop-over especially to not get jet-lag on the way back to Sydney staying in Singapore for us for 4-5 days is ideal. If you find nothing to see in Singapore, then you are not looking, so stay a while & enjoy such a lovely country to visit.","positive"

"7174","THE MOST DREADFUL AIRLINE BREAKFAST EVER While not expecting haute cuisine, the breakfast aboard SQ295 was just inedible. It consisted of a very highly spiced chicken sausage, greasy roast potatoes and a dish called bread and egg pudding with Swis cheese that had the consistency of rubber. There is no excuse to serve such poor quality food. To their credit the airline staff were charming and attentive and gave me a ham salad bun which was tasty and fresh. We booked early and were able to secure seats of just two but this was an older plane and the seats weren’t particularly comfortable. Sadly I don’t think Singapore Airlines is the airline it once was.","negative"

They have like most airlines reduced costs and it shows.","positive"
"1882","Don't be fooled they aren't that great...

Sorry to say any domestic carrier exceeds them without the fake smiles.","negative"
"4836","SQ Ultra-long flights SQ38/37 I was a bit apprehensive about taking these flights due to the length (15 hours outgoing & 17 hours return) as I have major difficulty sleeping on planes (even on flat beds), but the promotional offer that they had beat the next best fares by US$700 which made this a no brainer. I made some adjustments for this trip and bought a neck pillow (firm as opposed to soft) and took a sleeping medication which I usually avoid. Check-in and boarding was quick and easy as there were only 160+ passengers due to the configuration of the A350-900ULR aircraft. Bio-metric boarding was used in both Singapore and Los Angeles. Once settled in after take-off, drinks and dinner were served. Those who reserved their meals using the ""Book The Chef"" were served first, and I finished omg meal before the rest of the other passengers were served their meal. On the outgoing, I ordered the roast chicken rice and considering that Singapore is their home base, I was disappointed with both the quality and the portion. I was left feeling hungry. There were mid-flight snacks available later but it was western biased. I brought my own instant noodles (comfort food for many Asians, and SQ should seriously consider making it available on the flight - and I was not the only one on board who brought my own instant noodles). The 2nd main meal which was first served about 7 hours into the flight has now changed to 2 hours before landing based on passenger feedback. I agree with this change) and I ordered a nasi lemak this time. Again the quality and portion were disappointing. On the return flight out of Los Angeles, I ordered the prawn sambal rice and dim sim, and they were much better and portions were slightly bigger. The crew were excellent and were proactively going round to ensure we were well hydrated, and happily prepared the cup instant noodles when asked. The seat was comfortable. I was able to select the individual seat at the back which had its own hand luggage compartment. I was not disturbed by anyone else. Even the single seat in the last row was able to recline to its max and was not hindered by the wall behind. I was able to get about 3-4 hours sleep on the outgoing and about 6 hours on the return, which was a first for me. This was definitely helped by the A350 carbon fuselage technology which allowed a higher cabin pressure and more humidity compared to the traditional aluminium fuselage. I felt more refreshed and less tired compared to 8-hour flights in conventional planes. Flight was on-time on the outgoing but was delayed on the return due to a passenger fainting in the cabin during boarding. This delayed the flight by an hour but it was not the airline's fault. The captain kept the passengers informed on the progress during the delay, which was good. The only negative was that a number of fellow passengers were more keen to take photos/videos of the incident and blocking the passageway of those who were trying to help (cabin crew and other passengers). I would definitely consider SQ's ultra long flights as a serious option if I were to travel to the USA.","positive"

"4082","A Wonderful Experience On June 30th I flew long haul from Hanoi to Dublin and travelled the first leg of my journey with Singapore Airlines. The flight was on schedule, the check in and boarding was painless and the cabin crew were most attentive and pleasant. I had never flown with Singapore Airlines before and, I must say they lived up to my expectations and well deserve the good reputaion they enjoy.","positive"
"7564","Always impressive The service from SQ is so overrated and over-priced, I restrict myself to redemption flights these days. This was a return flight, which I can change the timing of, as it's a redemption, and I did need to do this. I called a week or so to move the return leg 2 days back, and was told this would cost $543. I explained it was a redemption flight, I was using air-miles, but the day I was returning was apparently popular, for no reason they could tell me, so that was it. I said a new flight is only $150, so how can I need to pay that for just moving the date?? But you can't argue with SQ, that's not what customer service is for. SO I booked a new flight with Scoot, just $120 for the new flight. I asked SQ to cancel the return leg and refund the points, which they refused to do until I had taken the out leg, so I called after that, and they cancelled the return leg and kept the air miles, to cover the ""admin costs"". Unbelievable. The cabin has that 1990s feel, with remote controls (no touch screen) for the TV fitted in the side of the armrest panel so your thigh constantly hits the buttons and interrupts the film. The cabin crew, as usual, refuse to smile, and avoiding eye-contact in case you asked them for something. I had to pay extra for the exit seat that has enough leg room for a westerner, but the recline button wouldn't lock after it released. I used the call button, and eventually someone came and cancelled that whilst I was watching a movie. When I was told just before landing to ""put my seat upright"", I said ""I can't, it's broken"", the reply was a predictably curt ""just make sure it's upright for landing!""","negative"

The second meal I had was beef served with the same steamed rice, the same beans and the same carrots, again with no salt and pepper. Again, the cup of tea was given without sugar, but upon request I was given sugar. The best thing I liked was my Krisflyer reward which I collected on board. The meals were the least liked part of the flight.","positive"
"10672","Travelled from Singapore to Auckland on the 10.25pm flight. Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing.","positive"
"7906","Falling Standards Singapore Airlines or Krisflyer has been a preferred airline of mine for sometime. I always delight in Changi Airport, and decided to extend my transit stopover by 4 days.....Heading home after a great few days, the namesake airline of Singapore is only now a sad reflection of what it used to be. Even the friendly attitude of the onboard crew is, while efficient, now clipped and minimalist. There is NO personal connection....now it's just a job. Sad. The food quality was the poorest I have experienced. On the 3 meals served, there was at least one or two items missing each time, and the food arrived barely warm. No longer my preference.","neutral"
"435","Thank Goodness for the Free Seat Even though it was a double-decker Airbus, boarding and disembarking where both pretty efficient, which is always a boon. Seats and legroom pretty good for Economy, but I do feel that we won the cattle-class lottery by getting 3 seats between the 2 of us - I'm not sure how well I would have coped with 12+ hours in a full row. Unless you can afford an upgrade, I doubt that you'll do much better than with SA.","positive"
"10825","Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 5'3 female. Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic “western style” of whatever meal selection chosen. I would’ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew could’ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. I’m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. Be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs.","negative"
"7258","Awful journey We didn’t eat at Singapore airport thinking our £900 fare One way each would include 2 substantial meals. Took off. Got a sandwich and coffee. Maybe a bowl of tiny fruit. 8 hours later a small hot breakfast. Worst catering for a long haul. The seats are so cramped and when the person in from reclines it’s game over for any kind of comfort. Crew lovely but working with a bad service. A few safety concerns such as blankets left on floor around exit door during landing (trip hazard in evacuation). Crew talking during take off and landing (should be focussing in their safety drills in case of sudden emergency). Toilet doors not locked during take off and landing. Also too many announcements which could have been all done at once instead of the constant interruption. Never again. Singapore have lost my vote.","negative"
"10011","My connection in Changi was just over an hour, which meant power-walking through Terminal 3 like I was in a fitness ad, but I even managed to window-shop before heading to the gate. Boarding the A380 was the highlight, my first time on the superjumbo, and honestly I get the hype. Quiet, smooth, roomy, and with pillows and blankets already waiting on the seat, it felt like flying in a moving library. Turbulence near Taipei thanks to a hurricane reminded me we were still in the air, but otherwise it was ridiculously comfortable. Seats had generous pitch, adjustable (if slightly stiff) headrests, proper tray table design, cup holders, USB ports, and power outlets. The IFE had a bigger screen than the short-haul jets, and it was slick to use. WiFi was patchy, but that is more politics than technology when flying over certain countries. Meal was chicken egg noodles in honor of SG60, tasty enough to not need extra seasoning. Toilets definitely showed their age, but the crew were absolute stars, friendly and attentive. Bonus points for baggage arriving in Shanghai without drama, plus app tracking so I did not have to play “Will my bag make it?” roulette. If the A380 is a dying breed, I am glad I caught it while it still shines.","positive"

"2133","Just ok Have travelled business with Singapore a few times and the service was exceptional. This time my family flew a mixture of Premier Economy and Economy to Perth. I have to agree with other reviews you don’t get much extra with Premier economy. Having said that you did get a bit of extra seat width which is the biggest benefit. We paid for extra leg room for our Sons in Economy and they had great seats when flying in the A380. I think paying for extra leg room is very good value for money on these trips to Australia. However they were not at all impressed with the food offering and snacks. All very limited, unless you like Asian food, you will be disappointed. Also if you happen to be the last to be served as we were on our leg to Perth or as my Sons were on the return today to London, food choices ran out! That’s not acceptable when so much money is being paid. Overall I’m not saying I wouldn’t fly Singapore again, but I’ll be looking at other airlines next time I fly to Australia or that part of the world before I make a decision. As an aside, I also think Singapore IT platform needs updating and spending up. The site is clunky, slow and the app isn’t much better. Look hard at your options before booking.","neutral"

The same was true of the short flight to Bali and I was impressed that I also got a meal on that flight.

"816","Downgrade service of the airline after Covid situation My route is flying back to the US using SQ from Bali, and transit in Frankfurt. Bali to Singapore operated with their low cost airline, scoot. Very basic service like the other low cost airline, so I cannot command much. Singapore to Frankfurt, 12 hours flight: terrible Meals, no snack in between this long hours flight, no in flight meal purchase option despite their terrible meal option. So basically you stuck with their horrible meal and other amenities. Cold bread, no salad or fruit, and very poor meal selection. No game in flight as you need your own device, poor selection of movie. The only thing they offer I observe during my total 20++ hours flight back to the states is WATER. Frankfurt to NY, 8 hours flight, another horrible experience. Same movie selections from the previous flight (Singapore to Frankfurt), the meals option is even worse as the flight attendants refer this as not a long flight despite it is 8 hours flight with no other option of their poor meals and limited entertainment. 1st meal is maincourse, second one is a very basic pork/vegetarian sandwich. The flight attendant mention ""we don't have in flight purchase meal or snack for passengers, whatever we have we will give it to you."" However, they do not have anything to offer to you. Comparing to my experience with SQ before the covid situation, flying with them in the same economy class, they used to give you warm towels after you boarding to the airplane, and before each meal, warm bread, fruit or salads in every meals, ice cream in between of the flight hours or different variety of snacks, eye masks, which I refer it as a great memorable experience with them. With my recent flight with them, I don't have any good thing to remember during my flight from Bali to NY beside a boring long hours flight. Based on my recent experience with SQ, I don't think this airline deserves a 5 star airline rating if I compare it with another 5 star airline like Emirates or Qatar, flying in the same economy class. For me SQ nowadays is like a budget low cost airline which claim to be a 5 star. For the price that slightly cheaper than Emirates, I don't think is worth it to fly with SQ and I will definitely not recommend this airline for a long hour flight to anyone.","negative"

The IFE is rather dated but the selection was rich. Cabin interior was cosy and comfortable despite the age of the aircraft, making itself rather distinguishable from their sister budget air Scoot. The most memorable part was the food, which is a portion rather worthy of premium economy or even business class of other airlines. Return to Singapore an A330 looked newer and IFE was touch-screen. Cabin crew quickly served drinks and snacks after take-off, as there was slight delay on the ground. Separately they served the meal, and again they did not disappoint. Topped it off with a Hagen-Das ice-cream. The price was reasonably good as I booked early. If you are particular about having good food on board, this airline is certainly for you.","positive"

"2506","World Class Airline Not my first time flying in SQ, never disappoints me for their tip-top services. The crews are very helpful and attentive. In-flight entertainments were good enough to accommodate my 6 hours+ flight. Although the legroom is not as spacious as Emirates, it is still comfortable enough. Always a pleasant experience to fly with this airline.","positive"
"10537","Melbourne to Singapore. Cabin crew refused to ask passenger in front of me to pull the chair backup when he served meals. I found it very unprofessional. I asked to speak to his supervisor, he then gave in to ask the front seat passenger to pull his chair up for me to have my meal. No more Singapore Airlines. I got the connected flight from Singapore to Nepal on SilkAir and to my surprise, before even handed my meal, the cabin crew asked the front seat passenger to pull up his chair for me to have my meal. I am not special, they have done that to everyone passenger.","negative"
"160","Excellent !! A great experience once again with Singapore Airline. We were in transit. The boarding was very orderly. On board service was excellent. The crew was very helpful and polite.

"8360","Book Specially Prepared Local Food Before You Check In Online. This is still the best way to get to New York from Singapore. No hassle, no rush, in flight food of your choosing, good headphones for the latest movies on seat wide monitors but best of all clean and dry toilets throughout the flight. Same for the flight back from New York except that there's no choosing of local food. However your choice must be made at least 24 hours before the flight ETD. The champagne and comfortable seat helps one to forget that the flight is 18 hours long.The well mannered young stewards on both flights made the journey much more enjoyable.","positive"
"8698","Great crew Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and the service was exceptional. The crew was attentive and authentic, unlike some Middle Eastern airlines.

Highly recommended.","positive"
"8932","very bad customer service flown with them to houston from manchester, flight there was correct, good food, plenty of entertainment and staff on board were very helpfull. on the way back, we spent 8 hours sat in the place before they decided to cancel it, by that time there was no hotel left and it was amost 4am, we should even have landed by the time they decided to cancel the flight, no hot food nor hot drinks offered. we slept on chairs in the airport without anything to warm ourselves up. when we managed to come back i opened a claim to be told they didnt have to refund me and pay me any compensations because they were not a european airline .... cheap !!!!! disrespectful !!!!!! unappologetic !!!!! I am appauled, an airline of this standing that think they are above the law and that their customers do not deserve compensations when they land 24 hours late .... never again !!!!","negative"
"9956","Extremely helpful cabin crew! The whole trip was amazing until a small problem occurred. Since the flight was from Japan, there was more fish than chicken on board and by the time the cabin crew reached us, they were out of chicken. We however didn't like the fish being served and decided to not get any food altogether, however the cabin crew serving us would not let us sit on an empty stomach, and soon came back with some food from business class, despite us flying on economy class! However, we couldn't eat the food served as it contained pork, which we don't eat for personal reasons. So then instead of giving up, the cabin crew then offered us cup noodles, which we then ate happily. I've flew to many different countries before and have had a similar experience of a different airlines where they ran out of food, however instead of offering an alternative or apologizing, the cabin crew on that airline told us to wait while 'they got us food' however they never came back and left us starving. Another plus of using singapore airlines is that if you stop over at Singapores Changi airport using Singapore Airlines, they give you 20$ per passenger to spend at any store in the airport (which by the way contains most big brands) and the airport also has a theatre, butterfly garden, a pond, massaging chair and a lot more ALL FREE! What more could a traveller want?","positive"
"2272","Still one of the best I flew to Paris via Singapore in November 2019. For the past few years, I’ve done most of my travel with Emirates because they are (usually) significantly cheaper - but you get what you pay for! The staff on my flight were cheerful, helpful and efficient. The in-flight entertainment was good (though any flight that long will stretch even the most up-to-date movie catalogues) and the seat was comfortable. An added bonus is a stopover in Singapore. As far as airports go, Changi remains almost impossible to beat. I’ll definitely fly Singapore again!","positive"

Meal portions were small, no salad or small starter was offered, no towelette and they don't provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal. WiFi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations ! All in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying Singapore Airlines again.","negative"

However the good things with flying on this B777-200 flight was that 1)it left right on time 2) the space between your knees and the seat in front was more than ample. It was a smooth flight and arrived on time. Then the disappointing things mounted up :- 1) my seat had little stuffing in the seat 2) my monitor failed to work after 30 mins 3)the movies choice was old 4) the remote was not user friendly .... disappointing The meal of BBQ chicken was horrible. 1) green vegetables were grey, over cooked 2) rice was soggy 3)the sauce was highly composed of sweetness The hostess didn’t give the elderly woman beside me a chance of a drink but gave her tea without offering a wine. Plus gave her pasta and not offering a BBQ chicken. Poor service ..... disappointing Flying from NZ I would have expected a reasonable good NZ wine but no it was a South American wine!! ....disappointing Finally with 30 mins before landing I still had not been offered Customs Declaration to fill in. I had to go and ask for one. First time in all my travel this has happened. My low score was given as this flight at least got us safely to our destination. My Singapore flight to Wellington a week earlier was outstanding.so I wonder what happened to make this Tuesday flight so poor?","negative"
"5022","Beyond Luxurious Hands down without a doubt the best Business Class flight Ive been on. I was luck enough to book this with miles which made the experience even better since I didnt have to pay for it. From the second you sit down they treat you like royality. Food and service were top notch. The seat itself is very spacious and comfortable. Would love to fly this business class product again.","positive"
"442","Broken promises to their customers I was looking to earn 1,800 elite miles to qualify for Silver status (status doesn't mean that much to me, but it gets you further up the waitlist when redeeming miles for flights, which I do care about). I contacted their customer reps prior to booking on a partner flight since I don't live in Asia and was told I would earn elite miles on this partner airline. After I flew, I saw regular miles accrue, but nothing credited to my elite miles balance. I contacted their customer service, who told me they would fix this but it would take 2 weeks. I contacted them after those 2 weeks and was told they would address it, but they would need at least 4 weeks. It's been about a month so I followed up and am now being told I won't be able to get those miles credited. I'm so incredibly angry about the fact that I booked a flight to earn this nominal amount of miles--and had confirmed I'd earn elite miles with them--only to be told I was given misinformation by them THREE times--and that they won't resolve this for me. I've flown with them quite a lot this past year and have an insane amount of frequent flier miles with them and am shocked at how poorly they're handling this.","negative"
"10790","As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didn't have the gf option for her.","negative"

There is very limited menu for the food specially for a vegetarian. The Delhi Singapore staff is rude and service is very bad. I want Singapore airlines should refund my fair.

"6120","Offensive experience of a new launch without respect New evening flight to Singapore from Johannesburg and the day I flew was the launch. If I had known this I wouldn’t have flown on that day. Checked in myself and had my e-boarding passes so went through to their partner lounge and we were notified by lounge attendants that boarding was taking place. Went to the boarding area to find a camera crew, various publicity people and no boarding taking place at all. While waiting they were interviewing people, having a raffle and waited for another 30 minutes while music blasted out of speakers. When it came time to board they started filming people boarding without any consent from me. I was so enraged I had to let them know they were offensive and needed my permission to film me. The gentleman checking Business Class in did apologize and asked them to stop filming but this made me feel like I was in a freak show. The experience on board to start with continued to disappoint me when I was served orange juice with alcohol in it, which I don’t drink, the meat starter and I am a vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian meal! What has happened to this airline that I used to love and respect? Not a fan anymore.","negative"

"255","Lack of customer support and organisation. Originally booked a flight through Singapore airlines for my mother in law to fly from Melbourne to Frankfurt, several hours before her departure the Singapore to Frankfurt flight got cancelled. I spent a couple of hours on the phone talking to both Lufthansa and Singapore airlines to organise the re-booking of her flight, i was bounced back and forth between the two trying to organise it before she had to check in from Melbourne. The calls took so long i made it to Melbourne airport and instead talked to the service desk and asked about the cancellation and they said it will sorted by the time she arrived in Singapore. Her direct flight got switched out for a Singapore -> Delhi -> Amsterdam -> Frankfurt. After receiving the email of the change only half an hour before her landing at Singapore i tried to talk to Singapore airlines to her a replacement direct flight as due to medical and language barriers she would not be able to navigate the multiple stopovers. Two hours on the phone got me nowhere and apparently every flight was booked for the destinations from Singapore to either Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, London or even back to Melbourne at which point a family member would be able to her get to her original destination without the insane amount of stopovers. The staff just kept insisting there is no available flights even for the day after her arrival in Singapore.","negative"

"955","NO MORE WHAT IT USED TO BE Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline, and I probably have traveled the maximum number of times. My travel this time has been probably the worst I have ever traveled before. Here is a concise summary of the problems I faced and still facing 1) SQ 31: Bad In-flight service, No snacks were offered. Very slow/ineffective attendants. Bad food. 2) SQ 516: Terrible In-flight service. I ordered a special meal 24hrs before, and it had been accepted in the system, but I was told their printout does not show it. On top of it, while serving the drinks, our row was missed, and when reminded, the flight attendant shouted, saying waaaaaaiiiiiit. No snacks and Bad food again! 3) That's not the end. After all the inconvenience I went through, when I landed, I got an SMS saying my bag was delayed. I went to the lost & found and filed the baggage lost form, and I was told that it would come on the next day flight and would be delivered the following day. Since then, I have made 2 phone calls to the lost & found department (they have been nice) and numerous phone calls to Dalui & Sons - the delivery partner (very very bad service). I finally got the bag after 5 Days. 4) More details on Lost Bag The Singapore air check-in counter suggested checking in small baggage as well, which I did. I had some important, regular prescription medicines in my bag, but the delay due lost bag impacted me. I raised a complaint to Singapore airlines, and they royally ignored it. No response. What a joke this airline has become. Finally, with all this trouble, I am not so looking for my flight back to San Francisco. This would be my last Singapore airlines flight. Not worth the $3000 ticket per person round trip.","negative"
"1683","A big difference. The difference between Singapore Airlines and Silk Air was chalk and cheese. I booked to travel to Darwin from Heathrow by Singapore Airlines. The first leg by Singapore was as good as one can expect - friendly helpful cabin crew, smart and always on hand to assist. Food pretty good. All change at Singapore. The Silk Air plane had minimum leg room and all the overhead lockers soon filled so it meant having to sit around bags, for a four and half hour journey. The cabin crew could not raise a smile and were grumpy. Being abrupt when people pointed out that they could not stow hand luggage anywhere. Food poor. Silk Air apparently undertake flight on behalf of Singapore Airlines so Singapore Airlines could do with looking at the Silk Air route.","positive"

"3345","Terrible experience for Senior Citizens We have been traveling by Singapore airlines for the past 3 years and their service has always been great. Based on this experience, we decided to book our parents on this airline. Unfortunately, they had a terrible experience in Sydney. They were requested to stay in the flight till the wheelchairs arrived at the Sydney airport. But when the wheelchairs arrived and they sat on it, they were asked to get up and walk. This was completely unexpected and an insulting experience. Please make sure you hire people with the right attitude and who knows how to treat senior citizens with respect.","negative"

From Singapore to San Francisco, attentive polite staff, great food, IFE system with many choices, easy check in, and now they use TSA Pre so my connection to a US carrier went smoothly as well. The only negative on the trip was the child in the row behind me who did what small children do from time to time. Ear plugs helped there. With SQ, the miles accumulation doesn't go very far, but ever since the US carreiers devalued FF miles, SQ is the way to go. THe WiFi is slow and $17 for the flight but if you need to check and send email it works.","positive"

"10964","Singapore to Munich. A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to. Landed at about 6:00 am and was in a taxi at about 9:00 am, which is far too long. The slow processing on arrival in Munich reflected the poor quality of the whole experience. Luckily the seat was so comfortable I had slept really well.","negative"

Plane was an A350-900, 9V-SHB and I was in seat 17K. Interior was clean, tidy and didn't look tired. I found the cabin temperature way too high, but am glad that it wasn't an overnight flight. Inflight wifi was being promoted heavily - it was active but could not be connected to. The pair-your-device didn't work at all. Whilst it is classed as a lie-flat bed, for someone who is 188cm tall and has size 11 feet, the bed is not a comfortable one as one's knees and feet can be cramped. No amenity kit offered today, although there are toothbrushes and other items in the well-stocked and clean bathrooms.","positive"

"7402","Los Angeles- Singapore by Sq35 Premier Economy Recently i traveled to Singapore on its new direct 17 hour flight. I have traveled quite a bit on AA, SAS & Turkish Airlines Premier Economy class in the past to Asia & Europe, always had a good experience. I thought SA new direct service should be on par with other carriers if not better. I was wrong! I used its ""Book the Cook"" online since there was mixed review about in flight meals. On this long flight, SQ served two meals and a snack. I was a bit taken back and in fact shocked when they brought out the first meal. It was in a small plastic tray, with shrimp entree covered in a twisted foil paper, a salad and a desert.( It seems that it missing something like appetizer, since there is empty space on the small tray). It just looked unappetizing and entree portion is very small. The second meal was served the same fashion. In between, they serve donuts and small finger sandwich. I have not touched donuts for years ! But i was starving and had to grab a super sweet donut! Service lacks throughout the flight, though flight attendant seemed to work hard ( i think the flight was understaffed!). No napkin paper provided when serving a drink and nuts. Had to constantly ask for napkins,spoon(for that solid ice cream). Approached the flight attendant at galley for a hot tea, and assured that it would be brought to my seat. The tea never came! The only saving grace is that i was able to grab one of the 6 solo seats at the back of cabin. My seat was comfortable and the plane is brand new. On this same trip, i took a much shorter 3 hour flight from Bangkok to Taipei on China Airlines economy class, i was served one meal in much more respectable way (in terms of presentation, quality and portion). This is longest direct flight i have ever taken-17 hours total. I won't get on this flight again. I work in travel industry and do not take this review lightly.","negative"

"6223","Great Consistent Airline Over the years we've used several airlines to make our regular annual visits to Western Australia but Singapore Airlines, in our view, are head and shoulders above other airlines which we have used. Singapore Airlines have the added bonus of flying out of Manchester, which means we can avoid the hassle of Heathrow. The staff are welcoming and friendly and the in-flight service is second to none. Just one small negative is the quality and lack of variety of the food, particularly the vegetarian options. That said, we don't expect 'haute cuisine' but SA, as with other airlines, could step up their food quality/variations. The A350-900 used on this sector is a brilliant aircraft, as is the older 777 used on the shorter sector from Perth up to Singapore.","positive"
"3757","Longest Flight in the World -- and a great experience Champagne comes around once wheels up .... a nice way to start a flight. This is the longest flight in the world - 18 hours - that takes you over the north pole, Russia, China and eventually Singapore. The service - in a word - impeccable. Constantly coming around offering liquids. Multiple food offerings - and the ability to pre-order your selected meals - not just ""low salt"" or ""diet"" - which are also available. This was our first flight to Singapore -- I thought it was interesting that on both the outbound and return flights, the shades are all closed -- I think to help people adjust to a 12 hour time difference. But, it was hard to get some sleep given that take off was a 10 in the morning! Entertainment options are great -- movies, television shows, games, etc. The seats are a bit funky, they don't recline like other airlines, but rather pivot and rock into more of a reclining position. And, almost forgot, on this flight there is only premium economy (1/3 of the plane) and business. Would have loved to upgrade to business, but at a 3X price factor ....","positive"
"834","Poor customer service We received an email from Singapore airlines notifying us of a slight change of time for our flight. After trying to log in to manage the booking, we were unable to do so. We contacted Singapore airlines to be told that our domestic flight had diverted to a different city meaning that there was a chance we could miss our international flight back to the Uk. After asking Singapore airlines to change our domestic flight to an earlier flight or to a flight the day before to give us more chance of catching our international flight, we were told they couldn’t change our flight to any of the ones we suggested. Extremely poor customer service, especially as their flight prices are extortionate now. If this journey doesn’t run smoothly we won’t be using them again.","negative"
"5651","Not a bad 23 hours! A* service once we were checked in! Like many other folk, I suspect, we were on an Air New Zealand flight operated by Singapore Airlines. This seemed too complicated for airport staff to understand! Travelling in Economy you are not able to check in on-line. So you arrive at the airport and staff direct you to a self check in machine - which doesn't work! So you try explaining to Singapore Airlines staff your dilemma, they tell you have an AIr New Zealand flight number so you need to check in with Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand airlines staff tell you you have a shared code,& you are flying with Singapore airlines, to go back go to business class check in there. We did go to business class check in and explain the situation. They did understand and checked us in without difficulty and with profuse apology. We did suggest the need for further training for frontline staff. From there on service was faultless. The plane was clean and comfortable. In-flight entertainment kept me amused for the full 23 hours, I can't sleep on a plane. We had a break of 2 hours in Singapore Changi Airport which by the way is worth a visit it's brilliant! and SO clean. The staff were attentive, polite and nothing was too much trouble. Snacks and drinks were there for the asking in between the meals which were perfectly adequate. I loved the whole experience, can't wait to fly with Singapore Airlines again.","positive"

"1757","Recent Trip on Business Class B787-10 I was recently fortunate enough to travel on the newish regional business class seat on SIA. Yes, the seat itself is comfortable, but the layout for me was a bit too snug for a business class seat. My arm kept touching the console and either setting off the call button and the monitor. The lights were at an odd level and food tray was odd. Overall it seemed all the thought put into the product was fine, but these finer details makes it a 4 out 5 for me. Unfortunately the current global health issue altered some of the inflight service, even though the cabin was more than half empty.

"10625","Hanoi to Cape Town via Singapore. I was very dissapointed with the way things were handled on 3 March 2019 before the flight, I was unable to board my flight, I let Singapore Airlines know via email, also tried calling but was unable to get through. I had to wait until Monday for anyone to help me and then got charged for a new flight ($584) due to missing the flight the day prior, even though I had notified the airline 6 hours before flight that I was going to miss it due to my Visa approval not arriving on time. Having paid this amount along with penalties for missing my previous flight has left me in a difficult financial situation so I'm not impressed.","negative"
"10277","A thoroughly pleasant experience, bearing in mind this flight was during the height of Covid-19 and New Zealand had just reopened its borders. Check-in was a bit truncated, given the amount of documentation required and the person managing our check-in was receiving training. Once on board the experience was delightful, food and beverage service was lovely, including signature Singapore Slings. The A350 was very clean, and I particularly like the additional screen on the handset. Legroom was adequate, though better than many others; that said, the flight only had 75 passengers, so my wife and I had a row to ourselves.","positive"
"2504","Great way to fly SQ 915 on 14/11/2019 SQ 918 on 18/11/2019 Always great to fly SIA. The meal selection and inflight entertainment are always good. But the outbound checking in was a little bad. The staff was so confused thereby resulting in a longer wait (express lane for Gold and Biz class).. The spread in the lounges is always best among all the other airline lounges.","positive"
"1749","Not actually a review but..., My husband and I had occasion to cancel our flights from Brisbane to London via Singapore and return because of poor health and worry about the Coronaviris. I cancelled online (Our trip was in May) and the very next day our money was back in our CC! The full amount, less a small cancellation fee, We are soooo impressed by this wonderful service. We have travelled with Singapore before and they were great, but we will certainly travel with then again! I have put in the date we travelled with them last,","positive"

"6777","Comfortable & Spacious We have flown with Singapore Airlines even in the past and flying with them has always been a delightful experience. This time since we planned our trip to Bali and there are no direct flights from Mumbai-Bali and vice-versa we planned to stop over at Singapore Airport since its the best in the world! We loved the service in the airplane and the meals that are served.They have really polite and friendly cabin crew. I really enjoy their Apple juice and the chocolate ice cream they serve..they are soo amazing.. Their in flight entertainment system had good variety of movies & music! I was waiting to see a good movie & when I saw Bohemian Rhapsody on the list.. I was jumping up and down with joy.. They also provide you with packed blanket, pillow & Kris Flyer earphones. Loved the seating and the entire experience of 4 hours.. I found it very comfortable and nice. Would definitely recommend all my family & friends to fly with Singapore Airlines!","positive"
"3747","Service is simply impeccable I fly premium one way, economy the return journey. The first seats are comfortable however the eco seats are really no punishment: there's enough leg space, the chairs go back a fair way to make it comfy. The service is second to none. Cabin crew always serve with a smile on their face. My number 1 airline!","positive"
"4762","a hiccup for a very good airline let me start by saying i'm a big fan of SQ. have flown this flt several times economy--and SQ economy is light years ahead of most transatlantic u.s. carriers. have also flown SQ business class and it is very impressive. BUT this is my first SQ premium economy and quite frankly, it was disappointing. the seats look better than they feel plus the trays are in the armrest reducing them further. the food service is essentially economy plus bubbly. the crew seemed lethargic and disinterested (thought i was on United for a moment) very unusal for SQ in my experience. based solely on this flight, the added cost of premium economy was not close to worth it.","positive"
"9854","Singapore Airlines looked after all the way there and back Having chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis makes travelling a bit of a problem, Singapore Airlines made it easier for me by supplying a wheelchair for me and helped for my vife and family who was travelling with me, we were ushered through customs etc fairly quickly and I had the wheelchair service right to the plane, can’t thank Singapore Airlines enough and recommend them to anyone who is travelling with or without a disability. Great flight, great service, great food","positive"
"7753","Wheelchair service! As a cancer patient who has just undergone chemo, my hands and feet nerve endings are badly affected. I can’t manage long distance walk and this the second time I had wheelchair service. Everything was a Breeze after I was collected at the check in counter, through immigration, to Priority Lounge and departure lounge. Was first on queue into the plane. The stewards and stewardesses were aware of my situation and were extremely cautious to my needs. Passing me a blanket straight away. Upon arrival I was the last to leave the plane. But all in order I cleared immigration faster than others. To my surprise food on economy class was okay. We were given chicken pasta or nasi lemak.I made a flight on biz class to Sydney in August ,the food was really not up to biz class standard...really sad to say. A relative just came back from Osaka was surprised that economy class food was edible and she finished most of it. I guess it’s the destination that we are going. Salute to SQ crew for their dedication and smiles all the way! Thumbs up! It’s a great way to fly!","positive"

They really work very smooth and fast during the take off and landing. They also know how to greet the passengers when the passenger were sleeping. I also like the food they, eventhough I didnt take all the sidedish because its too much. Beside the food, what matter most in long haul flight is the entertainment on board. SQ has so many variation of movie and I really love it. If you take young kid with you, there’re some movie and games for them to play too. Overall, I really satisfied with the service and I would like to fly another trip with SQ.","positive"

"9134","worst Business class In world There was a time ,everyone loved and enjoyed traveling Singapore Airlines In 1990’s and 2000’s ..it was undoubtedly No1 Airline not in Asia but whole world and retained its Charm and crown till Big three Qatar,Emirates and Etihad Stole that crown away..And believe me their are Valid ReasonsFor the same.I travel around the world 7-8 times.I traveled this week from Del to Melbourne via Singapore SQ 403 business class And I was not very amused and happy to see where Singapore Airline has headed once loved by the world. I traveled just 2 days ago from JFK to Delhi via Abu Dhabi, the service and seats they had was just dream compared to Singapore a 380 ..First I was given a 17 K seat which was Crappiest cramped seat I have been on A 380 business’s Class on any airline I couldn’t stretch my legs on this seat and it Was a nightmare ( see picture below)As I expected business class seats to recline 180 degrees to become full flat beds this seat did not I wanted to take a nap And couldn’t as this was not fully reclining seat, Singapore Airlines has answer why was I fooled into paying business class seat which Did not become 180 full flat as advertised it is a shame and disgraceful. Entertainment Kris flyer is from another era still old fashioned as compared To etihad’s Ebox one emirates entertainment system ICE is world class.If I summerise Ethiad's or Emirates's business class is better than Singapore’s First and and and I was stuck in Singapore Business Class. Singapore airlines should either have disclaimer about this worse seat Or shouldn’t sell these seats giving there customers a raw deal.Check out picture below the front of my seat was like a brick wall one couldn't nudge on this seat..It was really Disheartening to see once a favourite airline of the world and mine Now being disintegrated like this but reasons for the same Are valid and are self implicated. Etihad and Emirates don’t cheat their customers by selling Them something else showing them something else it was really appalling .On Etihad Business class seat of my travel just 8 days ago to JFK on Ey 100.while coming back I was so happy by Etihad service I paid $ 1500 To upgrade myself to first class as I just loved Etihad service and wanted a taste of their best and I was blown over by it.i am so so disappointed ,disheartened That I couldn’t wait to land and write email wrote of this horrible Experience in flight itself ..I wrote to Singapore airlines and got a clumsy response of changing my seat I mean it is so disgraceful and appalling. This may be my last Flight on Singapore airlines ever.God Bless","negative"

"11187","Singapore to Mumbai on A380. Comfortable overall with an excellent level of service. I've travelled on Business Class a few times on Singapore Airlines. Food wise excellent in choice options. I've used Singapore Airlines 20plus in the last 2 years and I've only had one bad experience in terms of service and twice experienced delays. Taste wise I've had a bad experience once and choice of food option wise I've not been able to select my preferred choice twice both of which was due to me sitting at the back of plane.","positive"
"11398","I have flown with them for quite some time now and while their service is usually robotic impersonal and lacking warmth flying with other airlines makes you appreciate how Singapore just does it right. Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again. They are extremely reliable their hard product is among the best and while their service is inconsistent when it comes to friendliness their efficiency is one of the best out there.","positive"
"6357","Round trip from Singapore to Seoul and back Bought the SQ air tickets since last year and travelled only on 1/3/19 to Seoul. The air tickets were much cheaper as we have booked them way ahead of our travel. The crew were attentive during the flight. The inflight programs offered were pretty new. The food in our return flight on 8/3/19 was much better than on the 1/3/19. We had bibimbap mixed with chicken and kimchi! Lastly, SQ allowed checkin 48 hours before departure flight time. 👍👍👍","positive"

"5014","Efficient and On Time Took a short haul flight to Singapore and back recently. Appreciated the on time departures on both occasions and the short flying time i.e. 45 minutes. The Airbus A330 - 300 that was used was comfortable and clean. The seats too seemed in good condition on the journey to Singapore but the the plane of the return journey seemed in less than good condition........seat wise. The seats we had seemed tired and slightly tattered and one of the pockets before us was unattached to the back of the seat. A surprise to to us. The flight announcements on both flights were excellent. The flights itself on the journey to Singapore was comfortable and we did receive a drink. This was not the case on the return journey because of some turbulence.........not much really but that was reason enough not to provide the passengers with a drink on this sector.","positive"
"6738","A reliable airline to fly with I travelled to Mumbai from Sydney on 25th December 2018 (on Christmas day). The seating was comfortable, and so the other facilities. The crew were friendly and helpful. The food and the beverages served were quite nice. All in all, I was quite happy with my flight. I returned to Sydney from Bangalore via the same airline on 1st February 2019. The important thing I want to mention about the Singapore Airline is their punctuality.","positive"
"7858","Short trip, excellent service I was surprised how good the service was, even flying economy.

One of the best airlines.","positive"
"4869","Singapore no more I have just returned to Adelaide with my elderly mother from Singapore on flight SQ279. It was by far the worst flight I can ever remember. I’ve been regular on this service, for over 30 years and also have travelled around the world, using nearly every airline there is. The food and drink service on this flight was appalling. Every time I had used this service, we were all served dinner shortly after departure so we didn’t have a dinner in Singapore. There was nothing to eat at all for around 4 hours when we were served breakfast, which was totally inedible. I tried both options and the standard was totally appalling. We were not offered any drink receiving only one or two small glasses of water. People on the plane all complained. I personally spoke to the supervisor and he offered me apology and sandwich which consisted of a stale roll with some sort of spread. It was also inedible and not of Singapore Airlines standard. You must offer water to your travellers as we get it taken away from us when we go through customs etc. There’s a real problem within Singapore Airlines on this service which I will never use again. The supervisor was embarrassed and he offered his apology and agreed with my complaint. I asked for a customer feedback form of which I never received. I tried to do feedback on the screen, but because I’m not a member my feedback was invalid. I’m never flying Singapore Airlines and everyone in Adelaide needs to know all about this. They all need to be warned and advised to take their own food and drinking water on this Singapore to Adelaide flight. I’ve now tried to contact Singapore Airlines via numerous means, but they appear to be hiding and not willing to engage with me. Very sad.","negative"

"5959","Best Flight I've Ever Had I cannot say enough positive things about this airline. We flew 18 hours direct from LAX to Singapore in Business Class, and it felt shorter than a 9 hour flight we took 2 years ago in economy from DFW-Mardid. The flight attendants were kind, friendly and genuinely happy to serve--""No"" is not in their vocabulary. The seats were incredibly comfortable, not only for my smaller frame at 5'4"", 125 lbs., but also for my big husband (6'2"", 205 lbs.). We both got a solid amount of sleep, the food was incredible, and the flight was overall enjoyable. The return flight home was around 16 hours, and was an equally positive experience. We flew from Singapore to Chiang Mai, and then from Koh Samui to Singapore on Singapore Airlines as well, though it was operated by their sister airline, Silk Air. We flew economy as the flights were short. The planes were a little outdated, but the service was excellent. They served a full meal on both flights, and offered full beverage service. All of our flights were on time, if not a little early. I have awful luck with my luggage when I travel internationally, and this was the first trip in years that my suitcase wasn't lost or delayed. We even had it transferred in Singapore on the way home as our flights weren't connected, and they managed to get it to the right place at the right time... with smiles on their faces, of course. I think that American airlines can learn a lot from Singapore air, and they by far set the highest standard for air travel. They have 100% earned their badge of honor as the top airline in the world year after year! Kudos to you, Singapore Airlines!","positive"

"842","Singapore Airlines Strikes Again! Well well well… Singapore Airlines strikes again! After yet again another usual delayed flight with Singapore Airlines (FR208), from Heathrow to Singapore, the drinks service was non-existent, the only regular service was for business and premium economy classes. After almost dying of thirst, economy class passengers decided to start collecting their own drinks! Absolutely no effort was made by the captain to make up for lost time in the air, even though there was a tail wind for more than two thirds of the journey! This followed with a lack of communication between the Captain and the ground crew as a parking space for the aircraft had not been allocated on arrival, causing further delays for passengers trying to disembark the aircraft for any further connection flights. Many passengers (about 45) had a connecting flight to bali from Singapore with the narrowest time window possible and yes of course the connection terminal was an early morning marathon as we all had to run from one side of the airport terminal to get to the other side of a different terminal within Singapore airport. All 45 of us managed to board the connection flight but guess what…yes you guessed it…the baggage was not transferred to the flight ! Another outstanding stunt and lack of incompetence from Singapore Airlines. All 45 of us who were on the connecting flight are now on the other side of the world, after a 17 hour flight, with no luggage, having to buy clothes, shoes and toiletries out of our own pockets. Cheers Singapore Airlines, thank you so much for your lack of care, attention, support and customer service. You have ruined our holiday and cost us a lot of money. None of the 45 passengers with missing luggage are any wiser as to where our bags are, as you have washed your hands of speaking to any of us and have passed the blame onto someone else as usual. You do not care care for your passengers once you have had our money! PLEASE DO NOT FLY with SINGAPORE AIRLINES , unless you want to be treated like dirt. If there are any Singapore Airlines social media representatives out there who wish to manage their reputation by responding to this review with fake apologies, then please do not bother, instead, find our bags, compensate us for our expenses, ruined holiday and lost time. Do the right thing for a change and look after your passengers!","negative"

"4008","Great Counter & In Flight Staff, Miserable Admin Processes While I cannot fault the counter check-in staff and in-flight crew, my grouse lies with the back room/admin department of this airline. I made a cancellation of a hotel booked on their web site that was part of their Singapore Stop Over vacation booked in conjunction with my air ticket and am still awaiting a refund almost two months from the cancellation, despite repeated follow ups on their web site through chats with their agents. I got an e-mail from them today stating that I was not entitled to any refund owing to a ""no show"", even though they acknowledged the cancellation and I verified it by going back to manage my booking on the airline's web site, where the hotel arrangement did not show any more. Truly awful service and way, way below what one experiences upon checking in and in the air.","negative"

"4319","Absolutely atrocious customer service experience Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport and after being flushed by this too and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation on the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, and this helpful assistance then was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. If going Aus to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers. My wife and I are absolutely appalled By the service we received from Singapore Airlines. We have made this same journey to Europe 7 times as leisure travellers in the last 8 years and this was by far the worst experience.","negative"

Having done the CMB - LAX journey many times on different Airlines, I can vouch for SIA’ s par excellence in flight service.

The boarding staff was not nice at all and not helpful at all, and we stayed in a much worse seat and with no apologies. The seats were dirty with food from the previous flight glued to the screen and food table disgusting!!! Don’t know how you could me elected best company last year!

We were in Business on SQ976 on the 20th of December and the staff went out of their way to ensure comfort. They were all wonderful. Thank you SIA for the experience! After flying QF for over 20 years internationally, now I have to reconsider for our next trip! Also I spoke to Jessica in the call centre - another star - helped me immensely.

There were no wee extras like Air NZ provided, the lounge for Koru Club members was not available as it has a SG code- even though we booked with AirNZ . I would never pay extra for Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines again. A waste of good money.","negative"

"11029","Full flight Melbourne to Singapore. Older 777 plane. Chose two seats together, there are not a lot of these, but they were great. You expect very little in economy these days as most airlines have made economy a miserable experience for passengers. Singapore Airlines still treats economy passengers with respect and I was so impressed. We boarded in sections in Melbourne, it was monitored carefully with some held back as they tried to ""skip the queue"" as some always do. Left a little late but not by much. the hot towels before you leave and just before you arrive are a nice touch most airlines have stopped. The seat was wider than most economy. We got a refreshing drink and peanuts shortly after takeoff. Two hours in was a meal. I chose non seafood so my seat was stickered accordingly, I had a fantastic lunch. Quality tender chicken breast in a lovely light soy gravy with perfectly cooked vegetables, hot crispy bread roll, crackers, cheese, water, dessert and real cutlery, Drinks though didn't come out until everyone else got their lunch and I did sit with my tray there till everyone else was done too. No big deal. Entertainment was probably the only thing that they fall down on with not the greatest sound quality. Had a nap after lunch, then a mushroom and chicken pie before landing, All in all the Melb-Singapore flight was pretty well near perfect and we even landed half hour early. Singapore to Hanoi was on an older plane again. Seats had some marks in them, pocket torn and window very scratched. The service was good still, but not quite as good as on the ex Melb flight. The entertainment system again not the greatest but watchable. The food too, another lunch seemed to be lacking both in quality and quantity but was still pretty good. All in all, I thought for economy flights, Singapore provides a better experience than I have had in years.","positive"
"3314","What a disappointment We spent months with our travel agent organising our trip to Vietnam. We decided to treat ourselves with a 4 day stop over in Singapore. We choose to fly Singapore airlines as they are so good. Our seats where down the back next to the toilet. We had no aircon above us. It was a very long warm uncomfortable flight. They run out of food obtions. It was the last leg of the staff's flight. I really don't think they gave a toss about us. So very disappointed.","neutral"
"8479","One of the best airlines no flaws with Singapore Airlines, luxury economy travel. We were on our way to Athens from Singapore and unfortunately for us I selected a flight that was operated by Scoot Airline which was the worst experience over the 11 hour flight with no Movie screen or movie, no food, no drinks. Terrible terrible. Actually a nightmare over that period of time after travelling in comfort from Auckland to Singapore for 1 hours and to have to have the next 11 hours (after 2.5 hour layover) in Scoot. Singapore airlines, do something about this please. My rateing is for Singapore Air not Scoot which would be zero","positive"
"8997","Economy at its best Normally fly long distances Premier economy or equivalent. But not on Singapore Airlines as there overall package for this class is one of the best. Attentive crew their aircraft fleet is top league, I didn't even realise we had taken off. Good food, they keep you hydrated, you can grab snacks at any time if you want. Seat fine, entertainment good standard. My husband is 6'2' and he finds seats okay as well. They deserve the status of the world's best airline.","positive"
"10434","Ahmedabad to San Francisco via Singapore. The overall in-cabin experience was fine, however, the check-in experience at the Ahmedabad airport was horrible. The staff gave me a hard time with baggage. It took 2 hours and standing in the check-in line three times to get my boarding passes. They weighed the personal bag and made fuss about the weight being 0.2 kgs over in one bag while it was 0.3 kgs under in another bag. I was told that the personal bag, which happened to be my laptop bag, cannot have anything else but the laptop and laptop accessories. I asked them if there was a scale I can use to distribute/adjust the weight across all my luggage pieces and they did not know or were not bothered to find out. Each time I had to go through bag screening and stand in long lines to find out that I still need to balance out 0.1 or 0.2 kgs of weight between my bags. While I was going through this ordeal, the staff is trying to sell me upgrade to business class in spite of telling him no once. I do have to mention that I flew Singapore airlines from SFO to Ahmedabad on Jan 27th 2020 and did not have a similar experience with luggage at the San Francisco airport. Given the coronavirus outbreak, I wish the in-cabin staff had some masks on hand to distribute to passengers requesting it. All of them were wearing it and when I asked for one, they said they do not have any.","negative"

"6141","The Best Economy (Pay extra for better experience) Singapore Airlines is clearly the no 1 for economy class. They are generous in their serving for food (with Haagen Dazs ice cream) and great entertainment (with wide selection of movies). The plane is also new (A380) and seats have enough leg room. The only negative experience is that you have to pay extra if you want to find a good seat. I waited for the free seats 24 hours before the flight and realise there are only left central aisle seats. Thus the experience was less enjoyable despite the good food and entertainment. Paying US $10 is definitely a must to complete the experience.","positive"
"3296","Excellent Airline, Great Cabin Crew I can understand why Singapore airlines is always ranked in top 10 airlines every year. Food on the flight was good. Great selection of food in the lounge, particularly at Changi Airport. Flight crew were professional and attentive. I slept pretty much most of the flight from LHR > SIN, and enjoyed the flight from Singapore to Sydney. Business class seats were roomy and comfortable. Tip: If you’re considering premium economy, i would recommend just sticking to economy and selecting seats at the front with extra leg room. I’ve done this in the past and it’s just as comfortable as flying PE. We flew premium economy from SIN to Amsterdam, and we felt the price difference we paid was not worth it - You do get an upgrade on the food selection, plus a tiny bit of extra leg room but it’s not really that more comfortable as an economy seat. If you really wish to be comfortable then spend the money on Business Class seats so you can really sleep in comfort + lounge access + priority check in.","positive"
"4482","Singapore Airlines is like any other airline It is like any other regular airline and infact the flight we did travel was quite old which was obvious to travelers' eyes. Food was ok and the flight attendants were polite. Not have much choice of food when you travel with kids (kids do change minds in the flight) and for my 9 yr old son, when requested for regular packeted yogurt they did not have. So my son traveled without any food.","positive"
"11063","Not so much (if at all) Premium. I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. My experience was nothing like the reviews I have read.","negative"
"8211","Short comfortable flight Comfortable flight. Flight seats choosen when booking will enjoy a breeze. Singapore flights are getting better with upgraded planes. please book correct flight timetable to ensure arrival with less people on arrival at customs.To make sure a leisure breeze thru customs with a smile on your face to star the holiday you plan. Bad was with my trip was limited choice of breakfast, and was not served breakfast as was told flight was delayed with time. Guess ////????","neutral"
"7160","Business class mixed rating I fly business most times and Sin business class cabin was very good. It’s very modern, comfortable and spacious. Their inflight service was good but slightly above average in customer service. They checked on you infrequently enough where I had to call them a couple of times. Inflight food was very good quality, I am vegan so a bit of a challenge which they met well, and I had to reject the final course as it was too much. The lounge at Brisbane airport was more than adequate. However, a big disappointment was the business lounge at Singapore. It was way over crowded ( they have 3 types gold, first and business) the food was average but tasty enough, alcoholic drink selection was good . I guess the over crowding was the worse part. Luckily I also have a priority pass and left and went into the SATS lounge which I found far better , less drink and food selection ( although make your own laksa was fun) but the decor was bright better laid out and less people was the better part.","positive"

What Singapore Airlines has recently presented is appealing. I have never seen so much incompetence and ignorance on a flight in the last 20 years. The SG crew has ignored my meal selection 4 times, offered the worse types of food for breakfast. In the end the staff offered Nothing for me to eat. What a disaster. Luckily there are plenty of carriers as alternatives which I will choose in the future. Do not fly Singapore Airlines from London to Singapore.","negative"

"11231","Shanghai to Melbourne via Singapore, we had exit row aisle seats and these were not too bad, but it can be annoying to get your feet and shoulder bumped in this position. However, there is plenty of leg room. The biggest grip we have is the temperature of the section we were in, I am not sure what was wrong but people on the flight to Singapore from PVG coughed the whole time, the air appeared to be very dry and was extremely uncomfortable and the second leg the cabin was like an oven! An astute flight attendant made a call and within minutes the cabin cooled, but it was the same on the legs coming back, just too warm. We tried to get business class but couldn't, so we opted for economy which was otherwise not too bad. The Singapore Airlines service was lovely but the most mechanical I have ever had - nice and pleasant but without any personality. The food was just ok, was expecting a bit more from this airline and also they don't give out bottled water so you have to always ask.","positive"

The trip ,the food and the hotel in Singapore were excellent and we returned with excitement. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure . The staff in the counter did not allow us to change to an early flight even though they have a lot of vacancy in the early flight. The staff in the gate changed the seat of my son with the excuse of putting us together. Instead he separated us in two areas. My wife was quite angry with the arrangement and I did not like to be tricked. They could upgrade the other passengers to business class cabinet in case of overbooking because the cabinet for business class was empty. The staff in Cathay Pacific would definitely do such an arrangement. Otherwise, they would ask for change of seat with honesty and courtesy. Stupid!","neutral"
"7646","The best Premium Economy Class I ever tried The leg room is more than enough for a 5 hours flight. Good food, but I think they have cut a bit of cost in the past 1-2 years. I like the headphone for entertainment, and the individual reading light when I need to focus and read on board. The reclining seat is one of the most comfortable seats I have tried, I even tried taking Premium Economy on my last trip to Germany from Singapore, 8-9 hours are still manageable, but definitely not as good as flatbeds you get in Business class. But given the price you paid for this class and the comfort you get, it's still quite a good deal.","positive"

"4885","Worst Premium Economy flight ever What a disappointing flight. Probably the worst crew I ever had, very inattentive, they looked stressed and tired. It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a much better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me. There are much better Premium Economy products out there (eg Air New Zealand with more pitch and ).","negative"

"11312","We were making a return trip from Kota Kinabalu through to London Heathrow via Singapore on 28th February 2015. We checked in at KK in plenty of time we were the first people to check-in! We were issued with our tickets but not told that we would not be able to sit together on the 13 hour flight from Singapore to London we discovered that by checking our tickets before entering departure. We returned to the check in desk and were told that they were unable to change this as it had been 'blocked' (We feel that we should have been told this when we checked in). We were advised to talk to the transit desk when we arrived in Singapore. On arrival we went to the transit desk the staff were very helpful but we were told that we were still unable to sit together. We had explained that my husband was a very nervous flier. When we got to the departure gate they were able to change our seats. Why could this not have been done earlier and alleviated a lot of stress for us. The breakfast meal was not very nice. Initially we were told there was only one choice which was Singapore carrot cake which we didn't want as did most people sitting near us. We were found an alternative meal which was cold! We are regular fliers to Asia and have flown with Singapore airlines many times but we feel that on this occasion the standard of service was not to the standard that we would expect from a premier airline.","negative"

"5496","Comfortable and clean We first time long haul flyers chose Singapore airlines as our main carrier due to reputation. Our first leg from Akl to Singapore was with Airnz and have to say we were impressed with their service, food and drinks. Expecting even better from Singapore airlines we were a little disappointed. Staff were friendly, food when served was plentiful (cant please everyone's palate) and water was offered regularly. Our first leg was a 13 hour plus flight and after being served the first meal we were then left wondering after 6 to 8 hours when the next meal was coming. When we finally asked when the next meal was to be served found out about 2 hours before landing. Was then told we could help ourselves to snacks ( sandwiches, muffins etc from galley). Have to say sandwiches very nice but if these snacks had been offered earlier or regularly would've given a higher rating. Seating in economy was what you would expect and the 3 of us being around 5 ft tall was ok. Blankets and pillows were on all seats when we boarded but felt compared to Airnz movie selection was a bit poor. The hot flannels handed out after takeoff and before landing was nice as was bag with socks and toothbrush and paste. A bit more information as to meal times and offering snacks ( without feeling a nuisance for asking), would be a positive move. Toilets were generally clean considering the usage and mouth wash, toothbrushes, sanitary products, hand lotion and cologne a nice touch. 8/10 for efficiency and timeliness.","positive"

"1094","Singapore Air is Price Gouging for people who rebook due to Covid I am disappointed that Singapore Airlines is price gouging and taking advantage of people who need to rebook flight due to covid. I had an oringinal booking from Osaka to Singapore for Dec 23, 2021. I could not travel due to covid and I wanted to push my flight back one year. Singapore Air would not let me do this so I pushed it back to April of 2022 with the intention of pushing that one back to Dec 23, 2022 when I intend to fly. I am now trying to rebook from April to December 2022 and my travel agency (Expedia) told me it will cost over $2000 per ticket to rebook!!! This is outrageous!!! The fares online for that date are $679 USD per person. I paid $569 USD for my original ticket and $130 USD to rebook to April the first time for a total of $699 per ticket. So although the website says its $679 to purchase a ticket in December of 2022, I am being told its the amount I have already paid plus over $2000! This is taking advantage of your customers. I have never flown with Singapore Air and I was excited to experience and see what was behind all the good reviews online. However, thus far, the experience has been much worse than any other airline we have booked through for this trip. Why can't you give me the price that someone booking online would get?

"6966","Depends on configuration We had a great flight on the 777 from Istanbul to Singapore (SQ391 January 27) as the plane was te latest version. This flight was painful. It was an older version of the 777 with the entertainment unit in the armrest and the seats seemed narrower. We are of a certain girth and the seats were too narrow for comfort. Also, the aisle seat (40H) had a box under the seat ahead meaning there was very limited legroom. The cabin crew were pleasant enough as was the food, but our row had an inexperienced team and we waited with our trays after the meal service for about an hour.. As a very frequent flyer, I will choose Turkish Airlines for this route unless the planes on Singapore are all updated on this 11 hour route..","neutral"

I normally fly BA to Asia (2 or 3 times a year), but this time chose SQ because I got a bit of a bargin. PE seats there and back for a few quid more then Economy seats on BA. From start to go the experience was an eye opener. Great seat, excellant service, meals very good. The cabin crew were round almost every hour with drinks and snacks.

The flight out to there was excellent and a couple of days break in Singapore (couldnt believe the price of beer $24 for a pint) was fine (Carlton Hotel was a good choice) caught the Singapore owned scoot flight into Oz.

The seats themselves are a bit mixed, yes you can lie flay but you need to sleep at an angle as your feet need to fit into a cubbyhole.

Its better you guys booked your seat via online before your flight. For muslim traveler, dont forget to order your halal meal via the onlne registration.","positive"
"5527","Best way to fly! Again, best flight experience! Polite, friendly, helpful crew members. Clean cabin/washrooms. Yummy meal: I usually don't prefer fish, but I did not mind this one. Unique ice-cream flavour, creamy and delicious, also supporting a local ice-cream brand! Wide variety of drinks, including red/white wine! Good selection of entertainment, including some newer movies! Would definitely fly with SIA again!","positive"
"9744","Excellent My wife & I flew Bangalore-Singapore-Siem Reap and Phnom Penh-Singapore-Bangalore in August 2018. We had a very pleasant experience on each of the four sectors. Reasonable leg room & elbow room for economy class (better than Emirates & Jet Airways). Over the years, I have flown Singapore airlines many , many times on business - my perception was that it was an excellent airline till about 2014 and then I saw some decline in their quality. I am glad that it has improved now. The one issue I had is that I had forgotten to book a vegetarian meal for my wife at the time of booking the ticket and the website did not allow me to incorporate this 48 hours prior to the actual departure of the flight. However, on one of the sectors, the cabin crew was able to provide vegetarian meal and on another sector, they were able to give her some cookies. I have flown on many airlines and my opinion is that Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and Delta are among the best.","positive"
"10796","Sydney to London via Singapore. The seats in business class are awkward, to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle, and because of this it feels cramped. We left Sydney at 7.05 in the evening, and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm, there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. The flight to Singapore takes 7.15 hrs, there was a 1 hour change over of planes. After take off we were offered dinner again, which having already had an evening meal I passed. The flight to London from Singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. Breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. It was served very late. I think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 22-23 hrs, and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. We will not be travelling Singapore airlines again.","negative"
"4047","A warm welcoming long-haul flight I always feel like home with pleasant flights with SQ. Our 12-hr flight was impressive and the team presented very high quality of customer services ranging from warm welcoming to small details, like rearranging the presentation of utensils etc. The crews were well trained and put their smiles at any moments I saw them. The in-flight entertainment demonstrated wild range of various films, documentaries, tv shows, songs, games, even language learning app. You would never feel bored during the whole flight. In terms of the meals, SQ also offered different choices to meet any requirements customers might have. You name it, they may have it prepared for you. I, personally, took regular ones and it was good. The mÕvenpick ice cream was like, hmmmm, so good!! But the breakfast was just quite fair to me. Generally, I felt so happy to enjoy the pleasant flight with this ripped off values of money.","positive"

"9161","The long journey home Excellent airline to fly with, they make you feel special without trying. Flew to Singapore by Boeing 777 which was fine and had a five hour stop over then on to London in an Airbus 380 (quite an experience). Overall the food and service on both legs of the journey were very good with very friendly and attentive staff. The inflight entertainment was very good and varied as these are long flights and you cant sleep all the time, a good film will always work. I would gladly travel with Singapore Airlines again.","positive"
"7786","One of the best available Singapore Airlines have upped the game. I've flown on Emirates, British Airways and Qantas in recent years and the new Singapore Airlines services tops the lot - by far. The cabin size, seating arrangement, comfort, service, lounges, attention to detail, food quality, drinks selection and cabin crew were all excellent. It's the cabin which really takes Singapore Airlines so far ahead of the others - although the crew on all of the other recent airlines were fantastic, having a larger, more comfortable seat, in a spacious area makes the world of difference. Not all aircraft are yet fitted with the new ""Suites"" but as they roll out, I sincerely hope I am able to fly on those aircraft!","positive"
"5151","A long flight from Heathrow to Bangkok via Singapore A good service with smiling cabin crew. Food was fine for economy class. Did have a choice from 2 options on the main journey. It is the timing and serving of meals that won't suit everyone. Flight left at 11:50 PM and the dinner served after an hours of flight. So the body clock is at 1:00 AM. Sleep for 6-7 hours and breakfast is served. But apart from that the crew try to make your flight as smoothly as possible.","positive"

"6912","Ein Wohlfühlug It has been several years that we had a long-distance flight with singapore airlines. Because of the strikes and the distance to Frankfurt( we live 100 km from Amsterdam and 90 km from Düsseldorf) . So we used for flying to Asia:, KLM, Lufthansa and Malaysian Airlines. But now, from Düsseldorf we tried flying Singapore airlines again and it was a very good experience. It was the 1. time in an airbus 350 and we think that it was ( comparing to 380 and 747 and 777) the best comfort we had with our seats. AND the service of the crew was really excellent! They tried to fulfill every wish. They make you feel like a friend. They remember your face and your wishes( like drinking more tee, or having the cheese-sandwich at midnight rather than the turkey-sandwich. They were always available if someone had a need. We were very impressed. Because our experience with the other airlines Is different. They disappear as soon as dinner or lunch is done. That feels not good. This crew was very good! They made us wishing to fly with singapore airlines every","positive"
"5878","Bathrooms are disgusting In both flights (Melbourne to Singapore and Singapore to London ) after the first few hours the toilets were so messy and filthy, unlike emirate flights no one takes care of the toilets, they don't even empty the trash during the whole 16 hours flight ! I was really disappointed !!!","negative"
"3798","Training on the go! SQ655 My first encounter was the cabin crew at the tail end, I witness for the first time requesting my violin placed in a safe storage from a young stewardess. The Chief Steward Mr Alex Lee took this opportunity to ask her a few question if she knew what’s the procedures to the passenger and she did and also answered well. Good training and guidances from a senior! Unlike the last trip where there’s a team of leading stewards and chief seniors, this was like a group of apprentice and new crew learning and they’re doing an excellent job! Good improvement in the cabin spaces and seat comfort. Legroom increased and I can even cross my leg easily while seated down. Recliner is slightly lower for the 787 and it lowered smoothly unlike its predecessors. However the Side panel control still gets triggered if passenger is too plump eg. reading light and calling steward assistance by accident! As for extra leg room the touch screen is where it’s a slight pain to one who has short arms. It’s mounted on the wall unlike the former fittings where it is housed inside the armrest therefore you may need to stretch a little to reach the touch screen...","positive"
"1759","Brisbane Trip Its a long trip so we booked business class with Singapore Airlines based on reputation. This was not misplaced judgment. I am not a fan of airline food for the last 35 years or so and although the food both out and back was not to my taste, it was beautifully presented and served. I have to say that I could not speak more highly of the cabin crews. They were very pleasant, courteous and attentive. They made the unpleasantness of long haul flying as good as it could be. Well done to all of you both out and back. Seating was comfortable and allowed sleep which is a bonus for me. Highly recommended and would be first choice for another trip.","positive"
"4435","Great seats and service, below expectations for food The business class seats are some of the widest I have experienced. Very comfortable flat flat with a slight negative comment on the funny angle one needs to place it’s legs. Great entertainment system. I fly Air France often, the seats are much narrower. However my expectations for the food on SQ quickly had to be tamed... little flavours. Below average carrot cake. Needless to comment in the cake. Overall great experience. The A350 900 is a stunning aircraft. Quietest I have been in on. Better than 787.","positive"
"8674","Fantastic as always We always try to get this flight if we can as it gets to Singapore the next day at 7:30am so you get the whole day to start with.

Apparently the air hostess forgot all about it, even though I reminded her 2nd time around. Extremely disappointed!!!!","neutral"
"7002","Always A Positive Experience I always find 10+ hour trips to be tiring and not the most pleasant. However, my return trips on Singapore Airlines were much easier thanks to the service and quality of flying with this company. The flight attendants work hard but are very polite and friendly and provide excellent service. I paid for extra legroom seats as I find it easier to sleep this way and another benefit is that I was seated across from two lovely flight attendants during the take-offs and landings. Note that if you opt for this legroom option the entertainment systems need to be put away during those times. I always prefer to fly with Singapore Air if possible.","positive"
"6096","Good but not as good as some reviews suggest I find Singapore Airlines is always consistently good without being great. Boarding at Sydney airport is a joke but that is more of a problem with gates 60-62 at the airport than with the airline. The seats in premium economy have a decent recline and staff are friendly. It seems to be a cultural thing with Singapore Airlines that once the main meal is served the cabin staff disappear. I've experienced it consistently in economy, premium and business. Don't expect staff walking down the aisles with drinks constantly as you get with Qantas or Air New Zealand, but equally, it is much better overall than the European and American flagship airlines. Overall Singapore is always reliable and Singapore airport is an excellent hub to travel through.","positive"
"5239","Short Restful Holiday Singapore Airlines were great to travel on, there was plenty of leg room and the staff were amazing. Check in was quick and even going through that process the service was very quick. Meals were good and lots of variety for entertainment.

"8230","Long haul non stop to New York Was on the new SQ 22 flight to New York for holiday. Was told happen to be the 3rd of flight since SQ restart non stop to NY. Premium economy was just right for the 19 hours non stop flight. Ticket was a little pricey compare to economy but then the comfort of seat and space make it up. Meals was not that fantastice as would have expected a little more choices. Incidentally took SQ 21 on return three weeks later. Overall good experience.","positive"
"10635","Singapore to Perth. The Singapore Airlines Boeing 787-10 is a first class plane and comes with excellent and attentive service from the cabin crew. Very modern Kris entertainment system. Food acceptable but not fantastic. Suggest they provide headsets rather than the earpiece variety which are hopeless.","positive"
"10325","SQ is one of my favorite airlines, but unfortunately in-cabin experience is less. Still great inflight entertainment (among the best in the industry) but food service is being downgraded. The round of drinks before dinner/lunch on longer flights, the appetizer on the tray and the hot towel upon boarding are gone. Of course nothing really serious, but with what you pay extra to fly with SQ it is an issue. Check-in process in FRA was efficient (as always with SQ) and the transit in SIN was a little tedious, as Germany (origin of my journey) was Covid-listed again: therefore it was not permitted to ""walk freely around"" the airport in January 2022 and I had to wait for my connection in a ""reserved quarantine area"". On the shorter flight to JKT you get now a box with (very) hot food, which is a downgrade compared to what you got before but still is quite ok. On both flights crew was very friendly and interactive.","positive"
"11296","SQ11 NRT to SIN. Airbus A380-800. Although it's getting older and older (PTV not touch screen while some other airlines already have one) service is great as usual. Attentive cabin attendants. They even know how to deal with small kids so they don't meddle with other passengers. Food was great except dessert. They used to give out H-Dazs Ice creams for this route but not lately maybe cost cut measure I suspect. All in all a pleasant flight.","positive"
"9753","Comfortable seat but long haul We flew with this airline as it was part of package deal with a tour company. Premium economy with Singapore airlines does not include lounge access unlike airnz. The cabin for this class is okay but you have to walk back through economy to the rest rooms.The seats recline and theres plenty of legroom. Try not to get the middle seats as it's hard to climb over sleeping bodies when you need to get up. Singapore airlines newer premium economy cabin has great viewing on the screens with many channels. They provide water socks toothbrushes etc. I would suggest booking a transit hotel in Changi airport if you stop at Singapore. It's worth it.","positive"
"8470","Most certainly a great way to fly The flight was on time as scheduled. The seats are spacious even for economy class and the service was great.

"6269","Never knew I could run so fast ! Singapore Airlines is without doubt one of the world's safest and most professional airlines. But who dreams up their connections? Just how is one supposed to transfer from SQ185 (Saigon to Singapore) arriving 22:55 (Terminal 2) to connect with SQ225 (Singapore to Perth) leaving 00:10 (Terminal 3)? For starters you always need to add another half hour to arrival times to allow for taxiing, so the estimated time was quite unrealistic. And Singapore airport is HUGE - it can take an hour to get from one terminal to another, although there are buses and trains (if you can find them). Made my connection with seconds to spare. Singapore Airlines - how about booking flights that don't require the athletic prowess of Usain Bolt?","neutral"
"4863","Super Economy Experience on SQ I selected this flight because it was cheap, and the timing was good, flying out in the morning and arriving past noon in Perth, and it was one of those special ‘hackers’ Fare found on Skyscanner. My major grouse on this particular flight is cleanliness. The cabin is smelly. Over the years, I have experienced declining quality for the inflight meals on SQ. So, it’s better to fill up before you fly. I can’t complain since I paid a cheap fare for it. Nonetheless, my flight back on Qantas was a much better experience. The bad odour in the cabin must have influenced my rating for this segment.","neutral"
"5795","Amazing service & flight The pilot made the flight a smooth & relaxing affair. We were in the large airbus plane & we didn't even realise we have taken off, it was seamless, as was the landing. It was the best flight I have been on. The staff on-board were very pleasant & helpful. Our seats were roomy & the screens on the back of the seats were very good & they have a lot of variety of things to watch. We pre-booked our seats & it was seamless. the only thing is you now have to pay to pre-book your allocated seats.","positive"

"10426","Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore. Due to the coronavirus crisis I had to bring my flight forward by five weeks. Once I got through to it, the call centre's staff were efficient in getting me suitable flights. Check-in at Haneda was friendly and quick. The ANA lounge was comfortable with a great view of the runway, although food and drink options were limited due to antivirus precautions. The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinese-style vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty, but the Indian-style vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive, with little curry and a lot of bread. There were several drinks rounds on both flights. I managed to get a good sleep on a comfortable long bed. Both flights arrived slightly early. All in all, an excellent experience.","positive"

"11562","I flew PER-SIN on a 777 and SIN-SUB on A330 last month. Good points: punctual comfortable seats great food great IFE (when you get the chance to use it). Bad points: On these aircraft types at least Singapore Airlines aircraft don't have individual air vents and it can become incredibly stuffy especially on the 777 where the cabin temperature was too hot - not the first time I have had this problem. Also the Surabaya flight was about 2hrs 15min which should have been enough to take in a 90 minute movie; but they didn't turn on Krisworld until about 30 minutes after pushback then 70 min later they collected the headsets and said they would be turning it off. In fact Krisworld kept running for another 30 minutes and was only turned off 15 minutes before landing. Had I known this I could have continued to watch the movie with subtitles - I think this was very poorly managed. Why can't they have IFE throughout the flight? - Qantas manages it.","neutral"

"1808","Shoddy service and poor quality of aircraft My wife and I have been extremely disappointed at the deplorable quality of service of the airline in general as encountered throughout the REP-CCU route in Jan 2020. We chose Singapore as we had heard lots of wonderful things about the airline. Our experience was worse than any cheap quality bucket-shop airlines and we thought Singapore was a world standard airline. On the REP-SIN Route my seat had a broken table which I was informed only on the way to the boarding the flight when I was suddenly being pressurised by their ground staff. Although I was waiting at the airport near the gate for over an hour none of their ground staff bothered to discuss this matter with me. It was as if I was being pressured and coerced into accepting their deplorable service. Furthermore the table was only secured with sticky tape which kept falling on my lap and on a couple of occasions fell on my watch! To cap it all having a disgusting experience from REP to SIN we then received further shoddy service from ground staff at Singapore on the Kolkata flight. Ground staff in SIN are rude and egoistic and do not treat customers with respect. We observed this behaviour of their ground staff with other passengers on the same flight. I made the mistake on relying on the name of this airline without realising how miserable their service has become from 10 years ago when we did fly with them to Singapore for the first time and were very happy with the service. Having paid USD 700 for our one-way ticket from REP to CCU I was shocked to be downgraded to an airline with filthy seats, filthy cabin no TV no leg space and in general badly in need of an uplift. You can see in the photo the filthy water trickling out of the toilets into the kitchen area behind the aircraft! To cap it all the cabin staff offered me gifts worth SGD 75 on the plane. This offer got progressively downgraded by their head office to a few miles on their shoddy airline. I refused the offer.","negative"

"418","Disappointment at the deterioration of Service Standards Singapore Airlines has always evoked a sense of safety and comfort. I have always enjoyed their flights and their care. So, as usual, I once again booked my family on the Singapore Economy for our vacation to NZ. Right now on board SQ 285 from Singapore to Auckland. Two hours into the flight, no drinks, no food offered till now. I had to press the service button to get a glass of water and the crew wasn't very welcoming. My wife also pressed the button for some water, no one came. She got up, walked back n git her water. I don't know, whether Singapore Airlines has deliberately lowered the service standards in Economy to push sale Premium Economy, but for sure there is a marked deterioration to the earlier famed Singapore Air hospitality.","neutral"

Return flight packed (This time in ECO as no room in PREM ECO), hot cabin, service stretched ... If you could call it service. I asked to borrow a pen to complete landing card and waited 30+ minutes. Had to ask again. Only thing I asked for in the 4 flights I took. I will NEVER fly this airline again mainly because the crew have zero empathy and the seats are SO UNCOMFORTABLE. If only I'd flown Virgin Atlantic ...","negative"
"6473","What not? Best and cheapest way to get from Europe to Australia is via Stockholm . Flight was great in a A350 and A380 - some had brand new seats some the older style Staff is the winner on this airline - while the champagne is not as good as on Qatar the service is as good - there was nothing we could have missed on such a long journey The team really knew how to take care I Customer’s- even one flight out of all of these the staff wasn’t in the best mood - sure the overall best experience was supreme Singapore airline always again","positive"
"10318","Order special meals from through their apps. In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out. I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm what's the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion.","negative"

Have any other experiences to share? Write a review “Horror service in Istanbul and Singapore from sg Manila, Philippines To make it short, had a flight with them going from istanbul to manila. On the way back i was denied to enter turkey due to corona virus( foreign passport holder restriction). I went to the singapore airlines customer service, i was told that I either fly with them back to singapore or get my own ticket departing istanbul. I choosed the option to fly to singapore, booked therefore a connecting flight going to bali. Short before departure I was handed out my boarding pass, showing that my final destination is manila, not singapore. Following this I had an argument with the staff, I was treated very arrogant, felt like I did a violation. I was told then by another ground staff that she will email her collegues in Singapore so that I possibly can entry. Once arrived in Singapore I asked the the sg staff if they received and email or call- none. The person in charge was even more arrogant denied any effort to help me or at least refund my travel ticket from sg to bali. Following this I was forwarded to a deportation room, felt like a prisoner there. Was allowed to use my cellphone only for a limited time in a demarqued area. Wasnt allowed to sit during talking even I was deadly tired. The story went on until I reached Manila. In short terms- desastrous communication, arrogant behaviour, chaotic terrible airline& service, never again!","negative"

Great food (for both meals) and the drink service was very good. The most comfortable economy seats with good pitch and soft cushioning. Great entertainment options with KrisWorld.","positive"
"472","Very average This was a real reduction in class from our earlier flight on SQ216; an aged Boeing 737 with drop down TV screens. Annoyed to discover that we had been allocated seats 53C & 53J, not adjacent as expected. So sorry, computer selection. Sorry didn't cut it with us as it was the 5th occasion that the computer had failed to allocate adjacent seating on Singapore/Phuket/Singapore legs of flights with SIA, this was the 7th occasion that we had flown either leg. Luckily for us an obliging passenger switched seats. Cabin crew were friendly but disorganised when distributing the meals. Shame that the same high standards are not maintained across all routes.","neutral"

"5952","Very disappointing We traveled from Melbourne to Singapore premium economy. I have flown premium economy previously with Virgin Australia and you could not compare the two services. We were not offered a drink before takeoff-on Virgin you are offered champagne or water. The cabin crew also serviced the economy section as well as premium economy but with Virgin you have your own designated premium economy crew. The food was terrible-a doughy pastry and that was all-it was an overnight flight but would have expected something lighter and tastier. This food was the same as economy so no different. Virgin serves you individually and you are given crockery and cutlery not plastic. Also cabin was not really separated from economy- they didn’t even close the curtain dividing the two areas! Also we had to use the economy toilets as there are none in premium economy-Virgin have designated toilets. The seats were spacious but other than that, I am not sure why we paid double the economy fare for this premium economy. Virgin also have a cabinet filled with snacks and drinks which you can help yourself to during the flight -nothing available on Singapore. A generally disappointing experience and definitely not worth the extra money.","negative"
"1936","Sydney to Singapore with a stop in Canberra I have flown this route many times on various airlines but Singapore Airlines is my preferred due to my SQ FF status. I get to use the lounge and have better access to preferred seating. This was my first flight on SQ288 departing Sydney daily at 9:30pm with a brief stop in Canberra. The full flight routing is Singapore-Sydney-Canberra-Singapore. May travellers get off in Canberra after a stop in Sydney. The route is serviced by a B777-300ER with First Class if you want. Loads out of Canberra are generally lighter. On this over night flight arriving one hour early at 4:00am I had 3 seats to myself and was able sleep for a while. However, the woman in front of me kept reaching back and touching the touch screen which turned it on and woke me up! What reach back all the time?? I had to keep turning if off in the dark cabin. We are at a hight alert level with the Corona Virus and all fight crew wore masks. They did not have to smile I guess but they said it with their eyes.","positive"

"566","A nice and great flight Although I have written several reviews of Singapore Airlines (SIA) before, this review is the first in 3 years since the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic as world travel had been limited and restricted since then. As the pandemic has more or less stabilised and traveling has been resumed, I also have restarted my ""walk around the world"". And all the while, I have been flying with SIA, unless for domestic flights. So I am sharing this recent flight where I flew in the business class of the A350-900 aircraft. First, the ambience was great and cosy and seat was very comfortable. I always prefer the Airbus over Boeing as the seat seemed ""larger and more comfortable"". And indeed it was! Food and drink wise, very good. I had made my order online and so the crew did not have to ask and served the food to us. They were tasty and nice and during our entire flight, crew kept on coming and asking if we required any more drinks or snacks and making sure we were ""well fed"". Kudos to the crew team, and of course they were very friendly and polite, not to mention efficient and smiles were always on their faces. Although the check-in and bording process were a little slow (not to blame on the airline itself but the local staff working attitudes and procedures), the service inflight was totally another story, it was outstanding! It's a comfortable flight, and also a stable one too! Even my 80+ mum was very satisfied with the entire flight experience as she didn't like to fly. It's good to be able to fly again and of course great to be back at the Business Class. Moving forward, in 2023, I have plans to travel more with the airlines and ""it's a great way to fly, and whose service even other airlines talk about""!","positive"
"334","Racist staff My family and I flew from Jakarta,Indonesia to Mumbai,India. The plane was predominately full of Indians as we were on a flight to Mumbai. The Singaporean staff were curt to the Indians on the plane, and seemed to think they were superior to the passengers. It was clear racism. As and Indian American I have faced many racist situations ,yet this was one of the worst. As I was heading back from the bathroom, the stewardess was in the middle of the aisle, I politely asked if she could move as I needed to get to my seat since the seatbelt sign was on, she curtly replied, “Wait your turn” as she turned back around. It almost seemed as if I was the staff and she was the paying passenger. The very same lady decided to act in a rude manner towards me the entire flight, from meal service, and even where I got of the flight. The flight itself was 5 hours long, and was hard to endure with an arrogant staff. While the facilities on the plane were alright, I would not recommend Singaporean Airlines to anyone who wants a pleasant racism free journey to their destination.","negative"

"9255","The Happy Airline Recently we flew to Singapore to visit friends with Singapore Airlines. If you have to fly economy this company seems to make it as pleasant as they can. From checkin prompts to baggage handling to your actual flight, the staff are pleasant and courteous and smile a lot. This is very important to us. On the plane the food was tasty and hot, free drinks and hot towels. Oh I love the towels! We had the feeling that we were in good hands. Our male attendant even took the time to write down some recommendations for places to eat. Lovely and helpful and caring. On out flight over we sat right a the back with no one behind us which was wonderful but on our return flight those seats had been filled and we were over the wing. I don’t like this so much as it cuts down your view. The toilets were also clean. The onboard entertainment was easy to access and use with a range of music and movies. We would certainly recommend this airline.","positive"

I ordered the Japanese set and it is so horrible tasting. Rice and fish which is supposed to be served hot is lukewarm. The portion is also so small. I think this is the result of cost cutting. SQ instead of improving with the rest of the competitors have lagged behind them now.","negative"

"2983","Rude treatment on flight! (Food and Water Trouble) I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess (the ones in my cabin) were pretty rude. It's like they just want to get their job done and they don't care about the people. I've travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely. For a five star airline, they should be better or equally good than Qatar or Emirates. But NO!! They barely offer water to people. And this time, they ran out of food! I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i can't. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn't even on the menu. ( However, I must admit that the food is good. Not as great as Emirates. but still good.). But I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn't last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. I looked at her shocked. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food as i was starving and eat the melting ice cream! In comparison, Emirates has a food bar for long flights like these at the back and also, ice cream is served not as a dessert but as a snack later on for those people who are awake and cant sleep. They walk around with water and juice trays so that anyone can keep themselves hydrated! But here, I have to go after them a hundred times! And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I took it from her as i was sick of begging for water. I had apple juice mixed water to quench my thirst and keep hydrated. I told myself that's just how rude they are and ended the rest of my flight. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup). I've asked for water in Qatar and Emirates flights while leaving and they've been nothing but happy to serve me and send me off happily with a bottle! Either this airlines is stingy for water or they don't want many people using the toilets or they're just plain rude. On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. I'd ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles!","neutral"
"3223","As always - an excellent Flight We have flown with Singapore Airlines for the last couple of years and they are always excellent, from start to finish. Firstly, the staff are always unfailingly courteous and smiling. That is in the air and on the ground. I have seen them in some extreme circumstances and they are always exceedingly professional. Besides who doesn't love a Singapore Girl and guy - right. The food is very good and the entertainment has something for every taste. The planes are new and the seating is very comfortable. Of course in Economy there is always the issue of legroom but it is bearable on Singapore Airlines. I have flown other airlines recently so I have experience different companies. Overall I highly recommend them. The price may be a little higher than some but it is definitely worth the money.","positive"
"11239","Chennai has no Business Class line through security so it was a long process, the benefit of this being that once you see the Air India Maharajah Lounge that you don't have long for the flight. The lounge is the poorest I have seen, looked more tired than those of Air Cubana in Cuba. Furniture was in disrepair, there was a bar that didn't appear to have been used for some time, sitting next to a disconnected fridge, no alcohol, food that looked inedible and was hardly warm and stained bulky furniture in the main room (this was full). Boarding was fast and efficient, the first leg meal was a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and carrot with no dressing, butter but no bread and chopped chicken in tomato sauce that was dry and uninspiring. The dessert was melon and was the only thing I ate and went to sleep. The Brisbane sector was better in terms of food but still not great and the first meal I was served I have had four times this year (turkey breast which if you order GF you can also get for breakfast) but the crew on both flights was friendly and responsive. The Brisbane crew in particular was excellent and provided personalised service by name. Slight delay on the tarmac at Changi due to air conditioning warning light that was being checked by the pilot but arrived on time. Bags out within minutes as we were the only flight there. If it wasn't for the crew I couldn't recommend SG this time.","negative"
"9718","Below the expectations - Flight attendants were mostly grim and sullen, except few. - Contrary to their image, aircraft was extremely old with an unsatisfactory and old fashioned In-Flight Entertainment system. - Flight attendants were just trying to push us to drink tea or coffee. They didn't give information about other drink options. We tried to find out other alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. - Lots of check-in mistakes. For example, they gave apart seat for my 5 years old boy. Thanks to smart airport c/in personnel they found a way to fix it. In short, if you have a long flight re-think other opportunities.","negative"
"6440","At last, Singapore Airlines! Overall, very good service. PROS: The toilets remained clean all throughout the flight. Flight attendants were helpful and attentive. AVERAGE: Somehow I expected better food; this experience was only average in quality, in hotness arriving to your seat. No cheese, no bread, except for breakfast. CONS: The bag of amenities was not at all exciting--a pair of orange socks with non-stick soles, a toothbrush, a tiny tube of toothpaste, and ear plugs. Choice of films so-so.","positive"

Nothing to citicize, absolut perfect service, very nice and professional staff on board. Always took an eye on me and on my medicine which had to be stored in the fridge of the plane.

"8065","This version is dated.. but it still delivers in every single way! Over the past few years I’ve flown with a lot of different airlines’s business classes, and I’ve learnt that the key to providing an amazing onboard service is getting a good grasp on all the elements, rather than doing really well with one and letting the others suffer. As we all know, there is no such thing as perfection.. especially when it comes to airlines, and there are always flaws but I’m reasonably confident in the statement that Singapore Air is one of the best and covers all the relevant bases pretty damn well. As I said, no airline is perfect and Singapore airways is no exception. There are definitely things that I would change but on the whole they are one of my preferred airlines to travel with.I’ve flown with Singapore a few times, but this particular review is of their old version business class on their A380-800. For those of you who aren’t plane geeks, the A380 is the double decker giant of their fleet, with downstairs holding 333 economy & 38 premium economy seats and the upper deck holding 60 business & 12 first class seats.You might be lucky to still get a version of the A380 with the old business class but if you do them your in for a treat.. savour the moment as this won’t be around for much longer! Although lacking an onboard bar, SQ's superjumbo’s old Business class is home to some of the widest business class seats to grace our skies. In fact the Singapore air old business class seat puts most airlines’ first class products to shame, it really is a positively enormous seat! Anyway before I get into it, heres some basic useful info for check in that might be useful if you decide to travel Singapore business: * Frequent flyer program: KrisFlyer, Star Alliance. * Priority check-in: Keep a look out for the blue carpet and 'business class' signage at the check-in hall. * Checked baggage allowance: 40kg, raised to 60kg for Star Alliance Gold, KrisFlyer Gold and Velocity Platinum; and 80kg for all PPS Club tiers. * Carry-on baggage allowance: 2x115cm bags at up to 7kg each, plus one additional item such as a laptop satchel or duty-free goods. * Priority security screening: Most airports will accommodate a priority screening lane. * Priority boarding privileges: Business class was called to board with Suites Class (first), and airline members prior to opening the economy passengers. On this particular journey I was travelling back from Singapore to London Heathrow. On the way out I had sampled the New business class on a different aircraft which ill review another day! If you’ve ever been to Singapore you’ll know that Changi airport is one of the best in the world, its beautiful and offers endless entertainment for its guests including its own cinema, butterfly garden, and even a fully kitted out 5* Crowne Plaza hotel inside the airport. But for me, it was straight to the lounge to enjoy the benefits of some of the money id just spent.. With showers, Charles Heidsieck Champagne at any hour and calming instrumental music playing in the background, it's a great place to both relax and be productive.This particular lounge in terminal 3 is also entirely separate to the adjacent KrisFlyer Gold lounge used by frequent flyers travelling in economy, but can also be accessed by airline members flying with SQ in any class of service. You'll also find a SilverKris business class lounge in Terminal 2 should your flight depart from there, although SQ's flights to Australia and Europe all use T3. I highly recommend taking advantage of the lounge if you have time as its a great way to have a much needed refresh before a Long flight, especially if you’re on a stopover. After having a quick shower and freshen up and also making the most of the alcoholic beverages in the lounge, it was now time to board the plane. As I said before, SQ waste no time getting the premium passengers onboard so there is minimal waiting around. As soon as you’re on board you’re greeted with a smile by one of the singapore air staff who are renowned for having some of the best hospitality of any other airline. Once my ticket was checked I was guided to my seat, where I was seated for all of 30 seconds before someone brought me a glass of champagne and a hot towel. A really nice touch by SQ, and one now adopted by other airlines is that the crew have your name memorised from the manifest and for the whole flight you’ll be addressed as ‘Mr Mitchell’.. or whatever. Singapore even go there extra mile and if you’re with their loyalty programme and they have your previous flights on record, they’ll even have noted small details from your previous flights such as you having a coffee before landing for example, and just like Magic they’ll come round and offer you a coffee just before landing. It really is the nice touches like that which I love about Singapore air. Anyway, lets talk about the seat, as thats where you’ll be spending the next 12 hours..Singapore Airlines old A380 boasts one of the widest business class seats in the industry, measuring a whopping 30 inches when upright.. I’m a big guy and you could’ve fit 2 of me in this huge armchair (a squeeze but still doable) it really is crazy big. just to do a quick comparison, emirates’ a380 business class seats are a mere 18.5 inches wide, while Etihad's business seats are at 20 inches.. a massive difference. However after flipping the seat into bed mode this huge width does become somewhat limited. If youve flown Singapore business before you’ll know they don’t use any conventional seat design, its unlike any other, and with these you aren’t able to turn your seat into a bed by just clocking a button. Actually its a matter of getting up and folding the back of your seat over to make it a bed. I always thought this was a bit of a bad feature and a bit of a ’steam method’ compared to other airlines but hey ho. Once this is done because of the seat configuration you have to sleep kind of diagonally so your feet slot into the space in front of the seat in front of you. Its a strange design but I’ve had it before and its not uncomfortable and still offers good space. A little tip, get the bulkhead seats as they don’t have this problem and you’re able to practically starfish in bed! I got the bulkhead on this flight, and even with me being 6Ft1 tall I had plenty of space and it was so bloody comfortable! I was able to get a good 7 hours sleep on the overnight journey home to London.You can also signal that you don't wish to be disturbed from your bed If you don’t want to be woken up for meals. When I did wake up a handy cover in front flips open to reveal a mirror so I could inspect how mental I looked after my nap. Also tucked away are two USB power ports and a multi-country outlet so you can keep your tech juiced! The seats were great as far as size and comfort goes, but regrettably they were starting to show their age after debuting in 2007. the controls and remote were all proper old school and the buttons were mostly worn down. But you know what is just aesthetics and I can forgive them for that. Now I don’t remember a great deal of the taste of the food on this flight because, big shock, I was trashed.. ironically I’m not actually a great flyer and I tend to get a bit heavy on the champers when I’ve got a Long flight.. its basically tradition now and its not going to change! while were on the subject of champagne.. champagne lovers will also take comfort in the 2007 Taittinger Brut Millésimé.. an impressive choice when most other airlines typically reserve vintage bubbles for first class passengers. As for food, I know SQ offer An extensive delectables menu to fill the gaps in between meals, with 13 snack choices including noodles and sandwiches and that kind of thing which I took advantage of after breakfast. Later in the flight lunch was served.. I had the chicken and mutton satay sticks with onion, cucumber and peanut sauce which was pretty damn good. I also ordered a goose liver foie gras which again I really enjoyed. For my main course I was presented with a staggering amount dishes to choose from.. there was literally like 50 choices, which lets be honest is absolute madness.. but pretty damn impressive. After taking my time reading the menu, I opted for SQ's classic lobster Thermidor. Sautéed in butter, flambéed in brandy, sprinkled with cheese and served with creamy mushroom sauce, garlic and spicy mustard, buttered asparagus and yellow rice.. it was mouth watering and beautiful.. it's again something I’d expect to find only in first class.. but it's still a real treat for business class passengers. For the people like me who enjoy using a long haul flight to catch up on movies, lets just talk about their entertainment systems.. KrisWorld, SQ’s inflight entertainment system, delivers a great variety of movies and TV shows on a 15.4-inch seatback LCD screen, or you can also connect your iPhone/iPod via the data ports or something more conventional such as a portable DVD player using standard TV RCA connectors. There was a good selection on my flight and I didn’t even have enough time to watch everything that I wanted! SQ provide Noise-cancelling headphones which do the job perfectly.. although a little uncomfortable on your ears after a few hours they’re a welcome necessity. They offer wifi onboard at extra charge but I wouldn’t use it unless I really had to as its pretty useless at the best of times and pricey for what you get. Service on this flight was totally exemplary, whats great is that because of the small segregated sections of the upper deck you'll generally always be served by the same two or three crew members, who in this case took no more than 30 seconds to answer call bells and were so attentive that often two flight attendants would arrive simultaneously to offer assistance. I expect nothing less from Singapore air and this is of course where they get their ‘best of the best’ reputation from. As I said at the beginning, a great in flight service counts on a good balance of all the elements required. Singapore air time after time delivers on this with a consistently above average service on all counts (with most elements being nothing short of excellent). The service, entertainment, food, and all the little touches are top notch and you really are extremely well looked after throughout the entire flight. Yeah, sure this versions’s seats were a little dated. But you know what? I actually prefer this, if you can get past the aesthetics and concentrate on the comfort then its actually a much more pleasant hard product than some of its more modern versions. The of course, the Singapore a380 also lacks an onboard bar which many of its competitors now offer, but to be honest I always see the bars as more of an unused novelty. I’ve often popped to the bar on a flight for a picture but rarely for anything else. When I can get drinks delivered to my seat at the push of a button I’m not sure why everyone gets so excited about getting up to have a drink at the bar? So its no biggie for me and I wont mark it down for that. Overall, Singapore air is hands down my favourite airline to fly with. Their hard product is always amazing (old or new) for space and comfort, and its also unique in the sense that no other airline has the same as them.. meaning its a totally unique experience. But even as far as their soft product, customer support, in-airport care, lounges, loyalty programmes, onboard service, hospitality, in flight entertainment and food.. they excel in all of them and give all other airlines a good run for their money! Even being on an older plane does not mean you get worse service.. their amazing service is provided throughout their fleet. The only thing they don’t offer which some of their competitors do is airport chauffeurs for premium customers.. which is something they should look into as its a great seeing point and a nice touch. Of course, all these luxuries do come at a price, SQ is one of the most expensive airlines for premium seats but they justify it with the product that they offer.. if money is no object then of course opt for Singapore air as they really are second to none in my books!","positive"

We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA.","negative"
"3292","Perfect flight Flying solo and for the first time in a number of years I wasn’t looking forward to my journey but I was soon at ease and was so pleased with the comfort of the seat the service was excellent and I really couldn’t have wished for a better journey to Australia. I felt very happy to be travelling with Singapore airlines and I shall definitely fly with them next time.","positive"

"237","Disappointing Singapore Airlines Premium Economy Singapore Airlines generally have a reputation for providing excellent service, and so we booked a Premium Economy flight SQ308 from Singapore to London, on 18 September 2023. Prior to this flight, we took a Scoot flight Melbourne to Singapore, again in Premium Economy, which was excellent, sitting in seats 1A and 1B. The Singapore Airlines flight was disappointing in a number of areas. We were not offered a glass of champagne on boarding, no flight menu was offered, no amenities kit, and very sparse service of drinks, in plastic cups (not glass). We had pre-ordered meals, my wife’s meal was first given to another passenger who opened it, realized it wasn’t theirs, and returned it to the hostess, who then read the correct seat number and offered it to my wife, opened! I had to request more wine during the meal, it was not offered. All in all, a most disappointing flight. We have Premium Economy flights booked on our return journey, not really looking forward to those. I would chose QANTAS Premium Economy in the future. Not good enough Singapore!","neutral"

"28","First class food Travelled from Man to BKK via Singapore and return. Outbound flight was on an Airbus 590 with the skewed sleeping arrangement which I found to be most uncomfortable. Although the seat was wide it lacked support for the lower back and I thought that the TV screen was much too close to the seat. The flight from Singapore to BKK on the B787 was little better as the seat was very narrow and the partition dividing the seats made it feel very claustrophobic. Again, I found there to be a lack of lower back support. This time the TV screen was further away. The return flights were very similar. However, where Singapore airlines does score highly is in the way that the cabin crew look after the passengers; service was superb and nothing was too much trouble. Food also was so much better than any other airline we have travelled on, especially the Book The Cook option. Also, the lounges, with the exception of the one in Manchester, were first class with an excellent choice of food available. Despite my criticism of the seats I would definitely fly Singapore again.","positive"
"7838","Non stop Very comfortable and extremely well catered for. Flight crew were fantastic and helpful. Best long haul flight ever experienced.

"10387","Trying to contact them by the call center is a nightmare with a lack of customer service and inefficient. The seats on this aircraft were the new regional business class seats which are not bad. The IFE is also good and we had 100MB free wifi which was nice. The crew were good. However, the food was an utter disaster. For a 7 hour flight, we were given 1 miserable meal which was rubbery eggs and mashed-up vegetables. Book the cook was not functioning on this sector so we had no other choice. No welcome drink either. Standards have gone down drastically from many aspects.","negative"
"7156","Good but still economy squeeze Melbourne to Singapore - 777 refitted plane. I last flew two years ago and was so impressed by the space of the seat and leg room I was happy to be going with them again, even if they were the more expensive choice. What a shock. They have reduced the seat and pitch size. We did depart on time and in row order. The teenager in front of me reclined as soon as we were airborne for the whole 7.1/2 hour daytime flight and my entertainment screen was a hands-length away from my face! Ran out of everything but beef by the time they got to us (seat 47). We arrived safe and sound however, but the whole experience was disappointing. Returning on A380 was better. We were on the upper deck economy which was roomier than the 777 plus has the added storage next to the window, plus there was just 2 not 3 in the row by the window (YAY). The food was dire though and almost inedible but at least we had the bread rolls and cheese/crackers were okay. So ultimately it is okay BUT it is still economy and you will have the squeezed in experience with no real bells and whistles. Is it worth paying hundreds more than other carriers? I won't go out of my way to book with them again unless it really suits or they have a deal going.","positive"
"4872","Not worth the money Having booked with Air New Zealand for a round trip to the UK we enjoyed our flight over with Air NZ and Virgin Atlantic and looking forward to our first trip all the way back with Singapore Airlines. Oh what a disappointment, paying the extra for premium economy was just not worth it. The only advantage was a bigger seat and priority baggage collection, no welcome drink, same food as served in economy, no nice glasses just the usual plastic, the white wine served was warm and the comfort pouch for overnight did not even include an eye mask. Sorry Singapore Airlines you have a lot to learn from Air NZ and Virgin on how to treat your premium economy customers who have paid a lot extra for their travel. We will not travel with you again.","negative"
"1675","Fantastic flight from start to finish. Check in at Manchester was extremely quick and efficient. Change over at Singapore was the same. All staff were very friendly and professional.

I will definitely fly with them again in the future.","positive"
"6760","It doesn't get any better than this Before I could even sit down, Stewardess Tracy helped me out of my coat and made sure that I had what I needed. She continued to be there for me throughout the 18 hours of the flight. She was lovely and gracious to a fault. I must also praise the food staff who provided excellent meals throughout. They even brought out a cheese cart at the end of the two main meals! The wine was great too. Finally, I loved the selection of films on the monitor. There were multiple Asian films with English subtitles that are probably available nowhere else. I look forward to flying Singapore again.","positive"

They also provided bassinet for my daughter to sleep on during flight. The aircrew was very friendly and really help me with the baby needs. They give us toy, they would warm your bottle if you asked or even warm the baby food or pack them if you want a go-to.","positive"

"926","Good as long as nothing goes wrong - they don't care at all We were migrating to Singapore permanently work work. I was travelling with my whole family. Typically we fly business with Singapore, which is an amazing experience. In this case I was given my marching orders and I had to get on the first available flight. Given our pleasant past experiences with Singapore Air the decision was a no brainer. We arrived at the airport on time but Virgin Australia simply did not process us on time. We spent nearly an hour in the queue and the lady that was checking us in was new and needed support, to which none was forthcoming from the virgin team. Needless to say we missed our flight. Virgin were absolutely dreadful, lost our baggage, blamed us for being late even though we were waiting in their queue, then sold us it was not their problem, call Singapore Air, so we did. To make a long story short Singapore did nothing to resolve the issue, left our whole family stranded when I had a deadline to meet, charged us over $6000 and wanted to charge us more for missing the flight, and have not responded to our lost baggage claim or complaint. Put simply you are running a risk if you fly with Singapore because THEY DO NOT CARE AT ALL about their customers. I travel regularly, needless to say it will be with other cariers moving forward. It's a shame because I have nearly 200,000 kris flyer points with Singapore that will now be discarded. BE WARNED, IF THINGS GO WELL YOU MIGHT BE OK, THEY DON'T SINGAPORE AIR WILL NOT HELP YOU AND FIND REASONS TO CHARGE YOU ADDITONAL FEES. THERE ARE NO PEOPLE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS TO ASSIST YOU. FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!","negative"
"1084","airlines with the best services? Services by the crew were not as good as I expected - despite promoting themselves as having the 'best services'. the food was not terrible but not great. the seats were not comfortable - I would say seats for Ryanair was better. I was also sitting next to the break room (?) for crew members so they were opening a bright lit room every few minutes throughout the 13 hrovernight flight, and I was unable to sleep. additionally, while the millage for my return flight was added, the millage to Singapore was not added so I contacted them only to get an answer 4 weeks later that the flight is 'not millage applicable'. Terrible wording of the whole email, no respect at all. I will never fly with them again.","negative"
"7075","Great but late take off! I am a huge fan of Singapore Air and a frequent flyer KrisFlyer member. I would have given 5 stars but the boarding of passengers was very chaotic, which is normal for Dhaka, Bangladesh. While the crew was very professional, they ignored the dozens of people moving about the cabin near the time of departure. Because of being one of the first to board, I sat for nearly 45 minutes before take off. This has happened to me before on the same route. Nonetheless, I highly recommend Singapore Air.","positive"
"5382","A Great Way to Fly! I have always trusted the Singapore Airline for their professionalism and aircraft safety. I am particularly impressed with one of the air steward's impressive customer service standard. As I was seated by the window (seat 57K), I did not get the chance to get his name - a Singaporean Chinese gentleman. His professional and sincerity in helping made my flight experience very pleasant. i also noticed that he will go the extra mile to ensure all passengers' needs were met. I highly recommend the Singapore Airlines anytime as the airline service does not start from the air crew but from the entire travel experience (airport to airport).","positive"
"5994","Rude staff and horrible landing We chose Singapore airlines and we were regretting after wards. Plane was good, tv screens were of good size. But crew members were very rude. They were not listening to anything. I asked for a glass of water almost three times during 5.5 hrs but noone gave. Landing was the worst part of our journey. Air pressure was not at all maintained, our ears were about to get burst. We will try to not go for this airlines in future","neutral"
"769","Best Economy Class Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class, spacious sets with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid, (same excuse to save money and weight_ a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was ice-cream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work.","positive"
"10855","Singapore to Zurich in May 2013. In April, to my knowledge, SQ 346 is very often packed and seat reservation might be difficult if you are two but on a different booking. On this particular flight I took a so called P seat which is next to the exit. Actually there is a lot of legroom left on the other side of the metal, there's permanently cold air coming up from the door. As often for a early morning flight 01.20am people are some of harshly due to sleep shortness. The cabin crew is very patient even if some become aggressive sometimes.","positive"

Efficiency of checking in was faultless and always someone around if you did need help. Use them again? 100%,hopefully pretty soon.

"58","Using miles for flights I wanted to express my frustration regarding the difficulties I've encountered while attempting to redeem miles for flight tickets with Singapore Airlines . I've consistently faced challenges with the redemption process, often finding myself placed on waitlists for flights. Furthermore, on multiple occasions, approximately two weeks before the scheduled flight, I've received notifications of cancellations, despite my repeated attempts to secure bookings. This uncertainty and last-minute cancellations have greatly inconvenienced me. Compounding the issue, despite my efforts to utilize my miles within the required timeframe, I've faced expiration of my miles due to these ongoing challenges. As a loyal customer, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and discouraged from further engagement with Singapore Airline. I urge you to review and address the issues within your miles redemption system to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience for your customers. Your attention to these matters would greatly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.","negative"
"10398","I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates. The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense. I am about as likely to trust Singapore Airlines again as I am to fly with them.","negative"
"4968","Excellent fight company Me and my partner used Singapore airlines for a 12.5 hour flight. I was dreading flying that long! The economy seats were standard but definitely nicer than some economy flights I had been on like Emirates. The staff looked great in traditional long Singaporean dress it looked very smart and professional. The service was excellent from all crew who were very attentive and friendly throughout. I had ordered ahead online as gluten free and the staff checked/confirmed this at the start of the flight and then served all allergens first, all labelled and coded to the allergen. I got a really gold meal, a tomato and vege chicken dish, salads, veg, GF breads. I was really impressed, for ‘plane food’ it wasn’t half bad - again certainly better than other companies. The flight had great television systems and options for film, flight tracking, games etc. I would be more than happy to choose this company again for a long haul flight.","positive"
"6677","Beware, you will be spoiled You will be forever disillusioned with all of the American carriers. Service service service...always with a smile. The flight was over the top. We had a very tight connection in Singapore and there was an agent with a golf cart waiting for us. He communicated with the gate agents on our next flight and they held the gate open within the 10 minute departure time. He let us know our bags would not not make the flight but there would be someone in Male who would coordinate their delivery to us the next day...all true. We were also compensated for our bags not making the connection...wow. Food...amazing. Wine selection...excellent. Lounge in Singapore is fantastic (return trip). My only complaint, and this is pretty minor, I thought the movie selection was very limited for an 18 hour flight.","positive"

The crew had zero smiles to offer. One plastic cup of water with no refills during a 2 1/2 hours flight (including wating circles over SIN). Assigned seat for Gold members at the back of the plane and the food was average at best. This flight felt like a charter or low cost airline experience but with the SQ price tag and came with a crew as unfriendly as on ... I've never experienced in 20 years flying SQ.","negative"
"517","Poor service, Liars and generally disgusting Firstly 1 star cause i cant put zero My family and I travelled to the Philippines via Singapore ? To start with a stupid little man split my family up When we realised we talk to a supervisor who said it would be fixed at the boarding gate. It wasn't, we spoke to someone again and we were assured we could sit together ? We couldn't. I took it upon myself to sit with my family, the guy who's seat I took was very understanding and sat in my seat. That was just the 1st leg. We had similar problems on the 2nd leg. I was not expecting to be blatantly lied to not once not twice but 3 times. We won't be using this s##t show airline ever again. I was full of praise for this airline before covid. Now the food I wouldn't feed to a dog. How times and standards have changed, not for the better. There are plenty of choices out there do yourself a favour and steer clear of these people.","negative"

I was pleasantly surprised by the content provided on the in-flight entertainment . Lots of movies; new and classics . Music content is enormous with a broad genre. There is also a vast selection of different news & documentaries available. Not to mention games for the kids, too... Food; as with past experiences; is very tasteful & well portioned. Cons: - Was charged data roaming on the flight. Not the fault of the airline's; but would definitely appreciate more prominent ""data on board"" signage or even video instructions via the entertainment portal. - Being an audio engineer, this is a pet peeve.... The quality of the provided ear buds is pathetic. In the words of Caroline & Don Davies - ""If bad sound is fatal, audio would be the leading cause of death"" - And I certainly wouldn't want that... ;-)","positive"

"10086","I took a flight from Bangkok to Tokyo via Singapore and was told that one of my luggages could not be placed on the flight from Singapore to Tokyo. The ground staff in Tokyo explained that it was because the flight I chose had a short connection time. No, no, no, this flight was recommended by Singapore Airlines when I made the reservation, rather than my choice. She said the package was late because I chose it? I have never heard such a nonsensical shifting of responsibility before. Moreover, the ground staff explained that Singapore Airlines is not responsible for checked baggage and that this was agreed upon at the time of booking. Well, this is what I call an irresponsible handling. She further explained that the package would not arrive at my place only after 2 days. In Japan, logistics is so advanced that it is normal for a package to arrive on the same day as the shipping date if it is in Tokyo. When I pointed this out, they finally arranged for same day delivery after a 30 minute wait. In other words, it was Singapore Airlines' fault, but they would not make the best arrangements unless we told them. However, the next day I received another call. They don't know why, but I was told that my luggage was not loaded on the scheduled flight at Changi Airport again and did not arrive in Tokyo the next day. Will my package ever be delivered? I have found this company to be mismanaged, irresponsible, and responsible without any shame. Please be careful, everyone.","negative"

Experience began from leaving the aircraft. Despite the flight being later arriving and knowing I had a tight connection, I say this to everyone now. There is no assistance for business class customers transferring. You'd think the airline's operations team would pick up business class customers coming in late and on tight transfer windows. Nope nothing at the gate. I got a bus to terminal 2, then got lost nearly went through immigration. Asked for help and directions and got to the gate as the flight was boarding. On board, well again, the food was average and service was shocking. Having run to catch this connection, when dinner was being served, asked for a beer and wine to go with my dinner. The beer to quench the thirst and wine because I love my vino. Was told will bring to you shortly sir. Nothing. Asked again. Nothing. Asked again nothing. 3 times and 20mins later. All too late. Sat there thinking should I travel Singapore airlines as this is some of the worst service I've had, similar to one of the budget airlines. but not they are actually better. Singapore Airlines will fail as a business if this is the level of service offered to premium customers.","negative"
"5156","Mix of feelings SQ operates different types of aircrafts. Perth to Singapore was A350, its newest fleet that absolutely a great one. Quite, spacious and modern. Comfortable flat seat with great entertainment - big screen HD display and noise reduction headset. The food and wine were brilliant. Singapore to Jakarta however operated older B777 version. Limited inclined seat and the seat next to me did not even operate properly. Something has jammed the motor, poor customer. The flight was rather short and inflight service was not as expected. The lounge in Changi was top notch, it helped for a couple hours of lay over. In conclusion, SQ is great when you ride newer or latest version aircraft and for longer leg.","positive"

"5951","World's No. 1 Airline for 2019 ... I think not! Having just flown 4 flights with Singapore Airlines (1/ Melbourne – Singapore, 2/ Singapore – Colombo, 3/ Colombo – Singapore & 4/ Singapore – Melbourne) I'm flabbergasted how this airline, across varied award systems, ranks #1 for 'World's Best Airline'. I flew Economy, so my review relates to that section of the cabin only. Also, my review is for 'in-flight' service only, and nothing 'on ground'. (The check-in process at Changi Airport is outstanding – seamless, and so technologically advanced!). Across all flights, the 'welcome aboard' by cabin crew lacked warmth and sincerity (instead is seemed a 'process' and/or 'obligatory procedure'). Having headsets available at the cabin door was both helpful and convenient, and the choice of 3 different styles of ear attachments a very nice touch (ticks there!). Warm (bordering on hot) refresher towels were handed out shortly after take-off (possibly the highlight of the flight!). Then came the menu. Where was the water/juice and mini packet of rice crackers/nuts before meal service? Also, where was the 'comfort pack' (nothing received on the Melb-Sing flight, but we did receive one on the Sing-Melb flight – just socks and toothbrush/toothpaste – no eye mask, and the little bag is very disposable (certainly not reusable like other airlines!). The pillow (left sitting on the seat with blanket) on all flights was filthy (both sides badly stained, as well as having food remains of previous passengers!). Overall, the food was absolutely appalling! The quality of airline food has come a long way over the last decade (or more), but the food we received on all flights was like that of yesteryear! The 'Appetiser' on all 4 flights was tin tuna salad – bound together with a glob of thick mayonnaise, and sitting on either limp lettuce or some shards of cabbage to represent coleslaw (I'm speechless, and some variety would be nice!). Dessert on the Melb-Sing flight was a mini/mini tub of ice-cream (how exotic!) Incomprehensible though, it was handed out 'immediately' after you'd received your meal tray (you hadn't even had time to finish the Appetiser, let alone Main Meal – so by the time you ate the ice-cream, it was 'cream' – almost a drink rather than a dessert!). I can only assume the Hosties were eager to return to their galley and relax – they hardly walked through the cabin offering water, etc, outside of scheduled service times. There was no cheese & crackers with the dinner meal – just Appetiser, Main Meal, Mini Bread Roll & Butter, Dessert & Tea/Coffee. Had the meal at least been appetising, the small amount of food could be forgiven. The Meal Cart carried no spirits (just soft drink, juice, tea/coffee, beer & wine). No separate Beverage Cart followed after the Meal Cart. If you asked for a spirit the Hostie replied ""I'll have to get that for you later, sir/madam"". The Hostie did return quite promptly (within 5 minutes), but just with a 3/4 full glass (plastic cup) of what you had requested – no mini bottle of spirit, plus can of soft-drink (so that you could mix the beverage to your own liking). The 'Refreshment' served on the Melb-Sing flight was Turkish Pide. I've never eaten anything quite like it! I love Turkish Pide, but this was a doughy, stodgy, tasteless oblong piece, with more-or-less no topping/filling (not sure if it was mean to be an 'open' or 'closed' pide). Breakfast on the Sing-Melb flight was most unpalatable, but I ate it because I was hungry. It consisted of Fresh Fruit, Bread Roll, Butter & Jam & Tea Coffee. The fresh fruit was frozen – it was 2 cubes of watermelon (more seeds than flesh), 1 cube of pineapple & 1 cube of papaya. There was also a horrible mini-muffin (in addition to the mini bread roll) on the tray – bonus! No tub of yoghurt, no egg omelette or egg quiche. What a pathetic breakfast! The Hosties were pleasant enough, when you saw them – though they did seem a little disorganised and confused during service. The in-flight Entertainment System received much hype. Personally, I didn't find it any better than other airlines. Navigating the system on the Sing-Colombo / Colombo-Sing flights was cumbersome. Overall, I was very underwhelmed with the service, and extremely disappointed with the food. I last flew with Singapore Airlines many years ago – when they were truly a wonderful airline! I was looking forward to flying with them again, but have been left feeling extremely disappointed. I have my preferred airline, and it's certainly not Singapore Airlines!","neutral"
"3054","Red-eye flight DEL-SIN Departing 945 pm Delhi time. Boarding was a little chaotic, with Krisflyer Gold and Premium Economy boarding at the same line as Economy - don't know why they didn't queue separately. Flight was on A380 version 1, which has Suites in front, premium economy in the middle, and economy in the rear (both lower and top deck). Flight appaeared to be completely full. Crew were patient and friendly despite the normal chaos from an entirely full flight. As usual, a hot towel service pre-departure. We departed on time, and meal service started almost immediately - again, the crew coped pleasantly with somewhat demanding passenger load. IFE was the older KrisWorld system without touch screen, but adequate. Seats had adjustable headrests, and legroom was adequate. Cabin was noisy, though, as there were quite a few young children travelling with the ensuing noisy crying this sometimes entails. It was difficult to get enough sleep in Economy. Just prior to landing (about 40 mins), attendants did a quick sweep through the cabin to offer refreshments, which was much appreciated. Arrival on time, and with a very quiet landing. It was difficult to get enough rest, but at the end of the day, this was a reflection of the passengers and full load rather than SQ. If you are lucky to get a much emptier plane (e.g. my Vistara outward flight), you may have a better experience. Nonetheless, score is for the product, not the experience. I have to say, though, that this leg was much more expensive than Vistara, so it depends whether you feel the premium is worth it.","positive"
"9944","Vintage fleet The standard legroom is average, too small for me, 6'3"", so I'm forced to pay for a seat big enough for a tall westerner. This means I sit alongside the bassinet seats with the screaming babies, will receive service last, am unlikely to have a meal choice, or time for a second drink, and I can't check in online, or through the machine as they have to see that I'm physically able, so I have to que up to check-in, and yes, I have to pay extra for all this when flying SQ. On this particular trip, the USB port on my seat didn't work, so I couldn't charge my noise-cancelling headset to drown out the screaming babies, and the in-flight entertainment system is so old that when I missed some dialog through the SQ earpiece (no noise-cancellation technology here) then tried to rewind a couple of seconds, it jumped back 8 minutes, so I had to sit through all that again. It's first generation, I've not seen these for some years now. The attendant offered a change of seat, but having paid extra for the babies and legroom, that seemed somewhat unappealing. They also have no air control at the seat, they just hope that all 200 passengers want exactly the same temperature, somewhat ambitious during boarding, where many are hot from the process, and the cabin seems hotter. The attendant told me that the cabin is set for the ""ideal cabin temperature"", and I remain unsure how this was intended to solve the problem. On the positive side, it was clean, and we didn't crash, which was great, but in the 21st century, we expect a little better than SQ currently provide, especially when they financially discriminate against tall people.","neutral"

I have flown them several times, and have always thought that no one thanks them in a special way ( albeit very small) for their top notch service.","positive"
"10576","Singapore to Bangkok return. In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN. Overall, SIA still manage to being one of the top airlines in the world despite some cost cutting. Take advantage of their promotions, which can sometimes beat the budget airlines by the hands down.","positive"
"10952","My wife and I thought we would treat ourselves to Premium Economy on a recent holiday to Southeast Asia on both the main legs, London to and from Singapore. We usually fly BA premium economy, but this was part of a package and we upgraded the flight. We are in our 70's and cannot cope with economy over 13 hours To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. The only good thing is the seat but the service is very poor. Firstly if you ""Book the Cook "" a pre-ordered meal, it will be served long before anyone else. The promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. This is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service. We were allocated Row 31 which has extra legroom but as the seat plan shows it is right next to the galley and we were constantly disturbed throughout the whole flight. Under no circumstances would I use this cabin again - not a patch on BA","negative"
"11341","BKK-SIN-MEL. Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible on the way home inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.","positive"

"5587","Best In Class Customer Service I had the pleasure recently of traveling with Singapore airlines both to and from Sydney, Australia - from Sri Lanka and I have only great things to say about the experience. First of all the staff are phenomenal - truly the most hospitable, customer service oriented air crew I’ve ever had the pleasure to interact with. Second - the cabin. Whilst not ground breaking in any way, it was always clean and tidy - something which is sorely lacking on many long haul flights. Third - the in-flight service - that too was impeccable. Finally - the amenities on board (such as the entertainment and meal options) were top class. I used to be of the opinion that Emirates couldn’t be beaten, but I have definitely changed my mind and will certainly seek to fly with them again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them.","positive"
"11487","We recently travelled business class return to Auckland via Singapore. We used both the 777 and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed an excellent choice of food and wines and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines but they are well worth the money. They will always be my airline of choice!","positive"
"11084","Singapore to Auckland, paid to fly Air New Zealand. Singapore Airlines was the code share. A little disappointed with the Singapore leg which was the return flight. Business class practically empty so crew were not run off their feet. My husband sitting beside me was served quickly but for some reason I was left waiting on both meal times. He had nearly finished before I was attended to. When the meals arrived (dinner and breakfast) they were the worst I have had on a flight. The seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out. The movies are quite a bit out of date and the screens aren't touch screen so hopefully they will eventually have that.","negative"
"9011","Wow! Business is SO different to Economy This was my first time flying business due to a frequent flyer upgrade. It's not just more legroom and better food on-board plus lounge access. The attitude of airport staff and cabin crew is very different too. More friendly and personal. I love flying with Singapore Airlines and am happy with economy - it's safe, confidence inspiring and efficient but the warm personal touch added in the air and in the ground makes the whole experience so much better. $3000 better for a 7 hour return flight? No, I couldn't justify it on my salary but I will do what I can to earn the flybuys points to upgrade again.","positive"
"1304","Dreadful customer service. My husband and I were to fly home from Houston on March 24 2020. The flights were ancelled because of Corona virus. We were notified 3 times of replacement flights only to have ach one cancelled literally at the last minute. We appreciate the problems at that time but when we tried to contact the airline we got a standard letter about how busy they were etc and would reply within 3 days. Of four or five emails we sent to them, we still have not had a reply to any one of them. Eventually we booked with American Airlines Houston to Dallas, Dallas to Heathrow, Heathrow to Manchester on May 10. The day before we were to fly the Heathrow to Manchester flight was cancelled so we got a train from Manchester.Trying to get a refund from Singapore Airlines for not using the return half of our tickets has been an example of dreadful customer service. We were obviously naive in thinking we should get half the return fare back each which would have been £240 each. The airline is giving us about half of that each, saying they have charged us for Manchester Airport taxes for landing and leaving and for other ""taxes"". We did not fly home with Singapore Airlines and we did not fly Heathrow to Manchester as the flight was cancelled. Trying to get an explanation of this has been impossible. We have not yet received any refund. We had also booked and paid for the same return trip to fly in September, these flights have now been cancelled but the promised e-mails to inform us of our options re moving the booking to next year or getting a refund have not yet turned up. Despite a flurry of emails from us to the airline to try and get this resolved we have been unsuccessful and have yet to see any refund. This is very sad as the planes, cabin staff, facilities such as comfort, food and entertainment are excellent and the route is very convenient for the UK to the USA. Just hope nothing goes wrong or you will lose out.","negative"

I always like to pay a little bit extra to get the baggage, entertainment and food included. The staff are always smiling and helpful, a credit to Singapore airlines. I'm a nervous flyer who suffers from anxiety in general so I need to feel comfortable in my surroundings. I never feel anything but comfortable flying with Singapore. Food was delicious as usual and plenty to fill the space in my belly. The only downside which I always find is the tea is not as hot as I'd like. By the time you add the milk it's lukewarm but apart from that small thing everytime I fly with Singapore airlines it's perfect. I've booked for Phuket next August 2020 with Singapore but my trip back to Glasgow in Mar/April 2020 is with emirates as they fly direct to Glasgow and the cost was much better.","positive"
"1235","Disgraceful service I paid an overinflated £1299 for an economy return to Singapore. Singapore Airlines is currently monopolising the market and overcharging customers brutally. Services were abysmal from stepping into the plane. Had to ask for BLANKETS and PILLOWS for a long haul flight. Commencing the 12.5 hours journey, we were offered 1 meal within the first hour after take off then absolutely nothing, not even a beverage for the next 9 hours. Despite being a day flight, they switched off the cabin lights 3 hours after departure trying to get everyone to sleep so they don't have to work. I went to the galley to ask for food and was only offered a fun pack size chips and a glass of coke with ice, not the 330ml can. Never felt so dehydrated boarding a flight. We were then served a small breakfast meal just before landing. Only positive is the inflight entertainment with a wide selection of Western movies. This is the worse Singapore Airlines flight I have been on with all the cost cutting measures yet overinflated flights. They do not deserve the 5 star skytrax rating. It feels more like a budget low cost airline. Absolute shambles.","negative"

"3976","Was Not Served Any Meal! This was our return journey on SQ406 (SIN-DEL) after we arrived in singapore 10 days before with them on SQ401 (which was definitely very good) Things took a U-turn here. The crew onboard was RUDE to the core. No courtsey, Zero on management. We were assigned seats at the end of the plane for 5 people. At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have NO food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own sumptuous meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals. No food! Nothing, not even asked out of courtsey! 6 hours journey. Surprisingly, they had the audacity to bring in meals twice for someone sitting at the back of our row. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it. The male staff was rude to the core. Shouts at you for no reasons. It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible. No channel to complaint to anyone. We could have done online checkin and booked our meals beforehand, but with the child, this is not possible to do so online and we had to do a manual checkin. Was this our fault? I don't think so. I would suggest to everyone, either avoid this particular airline (SQ406) or force them to give you seats in the middle, never at last.","negative"

"10526","Brisbane to Singapore on the late night flight. Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the “premium” price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable. Overall the flight was good, with a superb crew, and it is unfortunate that SQ do not match other airlines with their premium economy service.","positive"

Although I had already flown it with Singapore Airlines a number of times, my friend hadn't, so we decided to make a weekend of it in Munich. Singapore Airlines in-flight product and service have always been top-notch, and this trip was no exception. Flight on time, the seats are comfortable with generous leg room, IFE is very modern and the refreshment served on this leg is very generous considering the flight time is only an hour and a half. Even the little touches such as menu cards in Economy and hot towel they give you upon boarding, go a long way in making the travel experience that bit more special. What is also great is that Singapore Airlines was our cheapest option to get to Munich, it was cheaper than Easyjet. In sum, a highly comfortable and fun flight with warm and attentive service.","positive"

Cabin crew always smiling although it sometimes felt mechanical. Simple kit was also provided. DXB-SIN, B777-300ER was great however SIN-MNL aircraft was old didnt even bother using the IFE. Food served was not clearly advised that one option was spicy. I liked the food however overheard another passenger who doesn't like spicy food said that she wished she was told that it was spicy. Had some interesting encounters with cabin crew. First, a cabin crew used his index finger to give instructions to me instead of open palm/hand. Another cabin crew, during beverage serving, gave me the remaining orange juice as if i have no choice to make. Although both were minor hiccups. One funny incident had me cheering silently for the cabin crew as one of the adult passenger (father of another young adult passenger) kept on answering from the opposite row on behalf of his son every time a cabin crew would ask his son thus making a bit of a minor noise/disturbance. Cabin crew reminded the adult passenger that his son is old enough to answer simple questions. Fierce, i liked it. That's why im raising my overall experience score to 8 because of that.","positive"

Same applied to pre boarding experience (maybe my exp is limited to flights to India) The staff is rude and ill manners and security and boarding is like herding cattle in a barn. The holding area is cramped with barely 1 seat for 3 passengers. I had heard a lot about SIngapore airlines and the experience. This is definitely closer to the worst performing airlines and not best. On-board product was great no issues with that","neutral"
"11164","London Heathrow to Singapore Changi onboard Singapore Airlines A380 on the top deck in business class. Seat width very large and about 1.5x bigger than BA's offering on their A380. Seat turned over to create a proper bed with white cotton sheet and duvet and two pillows. TV big and movies were the usual Hollywood classics and recent releases. Dinner was superb - chicken satay canapé followed by crab salad and then duck rice for main with a dessert and fruit / cheese platter to follow. Where BA had the edge over Singapore was in the wine and champagne selection - BA offering 4 champagnes over Singapore's mere one champagne (Tattingger 2007). Also Singapore gave no amenity bag and instead gave the standard economy class sock, eye shade and slippers - I've had better amenity kit in economy in Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, BA to name a few. The magazine selection was poor as well with no suitable magazines for men under 35 years like myself. Service was tip top with attention on tap and lots of pleasing to my requests for their fine TWG tea selection. All in all a much better seat than BA given Singapore do a 1-2-1 config on business vs BA cramped 2-3-2. Would choose Singapore Airlines again so long as price was similar to BA.","positive"
"3830","Great airline, comfy seats, awesome food. This is the first time I have ever flown Singapore Air, and it was amazing. The quality of service that we received, even in economy, was phenomenal. You get hot towels to wash your hands/face with at the start of the flight. I am very picky with plane food, but the food that was on my Singapore Airlines flight was amazing. They were very efficient, especially with boarding and unloading the plane. Overall, was one of the best airlines I have ever been on and I will be booking with Singapore Airlines again!!","positive"

"6188","Excellent service and comparatively spacious seating Singapore Airlines impressed us with the extremely innovative flight safety announcement on the video screen. Very imaginatively done video! The seats in economy were reasonably spacious. Food was good. But for Indian vegetarians, prior intimation is advised. Did not like the airline serving drinks in Paper cups but other than that, satisfied with the taste and variety of food. Amazingly pretty air hostesses added to the charm of the flight 😊","positive"
"7398","Awesome Service and Hospitality I was very happy traveling via SIA with kids especially.

"5961","Service par excellence Our last flight of our holiday, SQ322 Singapore to London. An organised airport is probably the best way to describe Changi. Just two people ahead of us at check in; extremely efficient and polite staff there to help with the process. Had already been to the GST refund service, which, if GST refundable items are in your hold luggage and there’s a spot inspection, must be done prior to check in. Security check was slightly different than in Europe, as in the physical body scan and cabin bag search is done at the boarding gate. Once thru passport inspection, it’s into the retail, lounges and dining experience that puts Changi above so many other airports. Singapore Airlines Business lounge was pretty hectic, as usual. Decent variety and quality of food and drinks. Went thru for boarding as soon as flight showed as it’s quite a long trek to the B gates where flights to the UK usually depart. Absolute chaos at the gate; staff seemed over critical and pedantic. Lots of agitated parents, sweating travellers and crying children for the 23.45 departure. Once onboard, in to the upper deck business class area, it seemed a different world. Calmness and serenity oozed from every smile and gentle word of the cabin team. No sooner were we all seated, hot towels to all to remove the sweaty stress of check in and boarding. As soon as they were cleared away, our pre take off champagne or soft drinks arrived. No delay in takeoff, we were soon airborne. Next came the dinner orders, had we preordered? Oh yes, just to confirm that you still require the lobster Thermidor? White wine with that? Champagne? Red? Soft drinks? Nothing was ever too much effort or a problem for this team. They all worked so hard, so together, so effortlessly. Whilst eating a superb lobster Thermidor, a film from the huge selection was in order, along with a glass or two of bubbles. Meal cleared and following a quick visit to the restroom, I came back to my seating pod to find that my lay flat bed had been prepared for me, complete with duvet and pillows. Plenty of leg room and could lay 100% flat! During our 14 hour flight back to London the cabin team were constantly on the go. Had a good three or four hours solid sleep before being shaken from our slumbers by air turbulence. Shortly afterwards, once back on a level flight path, we (husband and I) were approached by the cabin team, all smiles, despite the hour. ‘We believe it’s your wedding anniversary today’ they said in unison. ‘Sorry we could not upgrade you to first, but as you know (well, I did as I’d tried for the surprise upgrade at check in) all the suites are full, but as it’s been our pleasure to serve you on this flight, we have a bottle of champagne from first, plus a few gifts for yourselves and your grandson who you spoke about earlier.’ We were then given a carrier bag of goodies along with a beautiful card and bottle of champagne. Breakfast followed shortly after accompanied by our champagne, then our decent into London. An amazing flight and excellent service Thank you all!","positive"

"5111","MEL to CPH Business Should be 5 stars for the excellent attentive service received by staff on board the MEL to SIN leg(One attendant in particular, Soleha is the best Ive ever met). Missing the last star in this review however due to the following. The red wine selection seemed to have slipped, the return trip a month later still had the same entertainment already previously viewed on the way there and lastly the Changi business lounge is getting far too overcrowded when it gets to the point where 3 people cannot fit a spot to sit together. Oh, another useful tip. Their partner airline SAS do NOT give you an empty seat in the middle of 3 in business as most other European short business flights between countries do. They put 3 passengers in a row together and you need to move yourself after takeoff.","positive"

"10622","My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class. Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip - no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea. We arrived in Shanghai wondering was that Singapore Airlines we heard so much about? We really felt disappointment. Nothing really bad, just a very very ordinary trip.","negative"
"10019","SQ177 in Economy. Check in at SGN fast. Staff polite, and courteous. They acknowledged I checked in Online, checked my Bag through, instructed me to watch my Bag go through security, and thanked me. Proceed to the gate. We had a Gate Change, and the announcement was clear. However when boarding commenced, Announcements were not clear, and extremely difficult. Volume was low, or speakers were out of service. Boarded, with a friendly, warm crew welcoming us aboard. Overhead storage not available, so had to use 3 rows ahead of me. Pushed back, and got on the Runway. Seem to sit for a while, ready for take. Took off, and right into Turbulence, so limited services. Eventually served a Meal, and Drink. I had the Fish, and Potatoes. As the Captain announced descend, Crew expeditiously coming around to collect Trays, and Trash. Smooth landing, and arrived into Changi T3, with the friendly crew wishing me well.","positive"
"6706","Korean Air LH and EK are better than SQ in Economy class I flew one way flight ticket for $880 USD Economy Lite from BKK Thailand to JFK New York City via Germany. It was average than my expectations based on facts: Seat issue: If you are with Economy Lite ticket, your seat is guaranteed in middle row or at worst - in end of economy class cabin. I flew in middle row and in end of Economy class cabin. Economy seat was uncomfortable at A350-800 for 13-14 hours. Painful ride with the uncomfortable hard seat. My legs had spasms and my back was sore and stiff after the poor seat cushion on SQ flight A-350-800 Singapore Airlines to New York City. Koreain Air, LH, and EK would treat you better with seat options that it depends on cost of the ticket and class you paid for. I paid $880 for one way - a long international flight with SQ. Meal Issue: Koreain Air, LH, and EK meals in economy cabin are superior and best quality than Singapore Airlines poor quality meal. I was shocked that SQ provided me a dinner meal: potato with previously frost green beans without a dessert. No fruits and no desserts at all on 13-14 hours international long haul flight. I miss Korean Air, LH, and EK economy class and liked their meals so much delicious not SQ. I asked Singapore Airlines crew members of the flight from SIN to FRA. They said that they do not have any dessert and no fruits. During snack break and down service - there was available only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. Service Quality Issue: Singapore Airlines crew often missed or skipped my requests for 4th time during flights BKK-SIN and SIN-DUS. I noticed SQ lacked punctuality and SQ has flaws with sloppy service that I noticed and observed. I requested for water, snack, and coke. They ignored my requests and continued to smile politely. My fellow passengers were puzzled and they witnessed. LH, Korean Air, and EK crew members are very punctual and attentive with each passenger's request. Economy class overall experience is impressive and wow factors are offered only with international flights on Korean Air, Emirates, and Lufthansa. Do not waste your money for SQ Economy Class trip! There you would not get any better treatment or best experience. Singapore Airlines earned an award only for a business class product and business class service thats all. It is just speculative hype by SQ based on my past experience in economy class. Nothing impressive with SQ Economy class and its service. Fly with Korean Air, Lufthansa, and Emirates instead of Singapore Airlines.","neutral"
"10529","Flight from Stockholm to Moscow. Swift boarding. Clean and bright economy class cabin, very comfortable seat. Impeccable service.

I got a special assistant because I flew myself carrying 1 baby aged 6 months and 1 child aged 4 years. it was amazing for me to feel service in the air that I had never received before. While I was carrying a baby, there was a cabin crew coming to calm down my daughter with earplugs. Then came the cabin crew carrying candy and feeding my child. then came the cabin crew again carrying cookies and finally there was another cabin crew carrying some pillows and putting them on my child's back.

"10518","London to Singapore. Check in area was chaotic to say the least and I had to label my own baggage prior to drop off. The Kris Lounge is a shared lounge and it was bursting at the seems, basically no seating, therefore had to go to local coffee shop. The service onboard was not what I expected from a 5 Star airline like Singapore Airlines. I would put the service down to being pretty poor and with an old aircraft to match. The only really good thing I can say was that the Wi-Fi was good. I expected much more from Singapore Airlines considering they are 5 Star and have recently won the coveted Skytrax Award for best airline.","negative"

"3283","Comfortable seats - great inflight service This was a long flight - 16 hours - and it was a great flight. Good food served at reasonable intervals. Lots of movies. In premium economy, the seats were roomy (wide) and had plenty of leg room. We had plenty of storage space for our carry on. The bathrooms were kept clean and we were able to get up and walk around periodically. The only slight downside was infrequent beverage service - recommend taking your own water bottle.","positive"
"10823","Singapore to Tokyo Narita. Premium Economy Class Seats: Wider and well-cushioned. However, we were disappointed with quality. The buttons for recline and the foot rest was not working well. We actually had to force the foot rest out. This certainly isn't expected for Singapore Airlines (ANA on the contrary had everything in tip top condition). Entertainment: One of the airlines with the most decent entertainment. However, my headset was faulty. It was replaced but again, not expected. It should have been checked. Food: I used ""Book the Cook'. I expected the food to be better but found it so-so. Cabin crew took a really long time to clear the food. When I tried to return it, I was flatly rejected, the crew told me to wait. The entire process from start to end took 2 hours! It was crazy! SQ 633 was way much more efficient. Crew was pretty cheerful and the crew made the effort to confirm our meals with us before they took off. They surprised us with an anniversary cake as well. We like the customer engagement they provided. SQ 12 on the other hand appeared grouchy and unhappy to me - no confirmation on the food was made and they took so long to finish the meal service. Premium Economy has a cabin on its own. However, on both flights, the curtains were not drawn. We had passengers from Economy trying to sneak into the Premium Economy seats or use the toilets in Business Class. There were also kids (in Economy class) walking to and fro the Premium Economy cabins. This should have been controlled as my husband was trying to do some work on the plane and I was trying to rest but could not. While I try to be understanding on young children in the plane, it is definitely awful to have a child crying/screaming for 6 hours on a 7 hours flight. What made it worse was that seats with bassinets in the Economy class were directly behind the Premium Economy class. Overall, we were not very impressed with the quality of Premium Economy Class. Singapore Airlines have always been expected to be premium (along the lines with ANA/Qatar/Emirates). For the amount of money spent, I would very much go for ANA.","negative"
"10072","First time on Premium economy and with Singapore for some considerable time. We were travelling from Syd via Singapore to NYC. We had a 12 hr stop (air side) in the Aerotel at Changi between flights. The flight from Syd left pretty much on time on SA's A350-900 for the 8hr trip. Premium economy is set up 2 x 4 x 2 and we had seats 32A and 32C for this leg on the left side of the aircraft. The in flight service was pretty much as we would have expected and hoped for - excellent. We were provided with hot towel before a small glass of sparkling wine (new for us). The seating was a step up from economy being slightly wider and with the increased pitch and recline (plenty of YouTube reviews of this). The trays were stowed in the centre partition between the seats that prevented this from being used as might with an economy seat - but wasn't an issue. We took advantage of the Book the Cook option for meal selection, which was quite extensive (but not available for all services). This meant stewards checked and confirmed our orders and we were served early. The food was overall very good on this flight and they provide you with a full meal service, that is individual small salad, separate mains, dessert, condiments, full steel cutlery, ceramic or porcelain dishes, water, cloth napkins and tray liner. Could not complain and food quality was very good. Qantas could learn a thing or three from SA regarding full carrier meals services as their standards have dropped significantly in recent years to a single one dish type of offering. (at least in their economy class) Additional drinks including tea/coffee, wine, beer or spirits were service just after meals were delivered and on request throughout the flight. Some additional snacks were available from the galley or on request. Most importantly the flight was smooth and seamless as was the on time and safe landing at Changi. It was a bit of a treat having experienced Premium economy and would recommend trying this if able to do so particularly for longer flights. We found the 8+ hrs to Singapore wasn't to much to manage in economy. However of our 4 flights despite being great was probably 4th in overall comfort and experience. Flight 2 - SQ024 - Singapore to NYC - A350-900 We had the 18+ hr flight from Changi to JFK in NYC coming up (which is currently the longest commercially operated flight). This flight only caters for 2 seating classes, Business and Premium economy there is no economy available on this flight due to logistical considerations and overall much less passenger load. We were seated in 39A and 39C for the flight. Again departure was pretty much on time and we set off on this epic journey. The staff were excellent and again we had opted for the Book the Cook menu selection for some of our meals. We were very fortunate with this flight path that passed over Alaska/north pole region and had fantastic views over the upper Rocky Mountains and skirted by Mt McKinley (highest peak in N. America). The 18+ hours passed relatively easily and Singapore Airlines on board entertainment suite provided ample selection to keep you amused. Additional drinks etc were offered throughout the flight. JFK arrival late afternoon/early evening was on time.","positive"
"11655","LHR-SIN. I couldn't book the open-jaw route I wanted on SQ's awful website so booked it as a codeshare with Virgin Atlantic which made online check-in impossible - VS site said the operating airline was someone else and SQ said the booking had been made through a different airline. I phoned VS and they were worse than useless SQ at least sympathised and the gent I spoke to said he would send a message to LHR requesting the seat I was hoping for. I was one of the last to check-in and indeed a window on the left had been saved for me so kudos for that. Boarding was OK although the cabin crew in my area didn't speak much English which complicated some pax requests for reseating. First meal service was OK lots of movies but not many good ones seat comfortable and managed some sleep. One reason I booked SQ was to enjoy an Asian style breakfast so you can imagine my frustration that despite distributing a lavish eight page printed menu to economy passengers which included three breakfast options (including a tasty-sounding pork and noodles exactly what I'd had in mind) they were only able to offer ""chicken sausage with frittata"" which was as disgusting as it sounds. Arrived on time and customs and baggage claim was pretty quick. Beyond being deposited at the destination safely and on time SQ fell short of expectations. Will not go out of my way to fly them again.","negative"
"2037","Huge payment glitch at booking - Poor recognition of frequent flyers This happened when booking a ticket for a trip in June 2020. Singapore airlines website has a timeout bug at the payment level and I had to book several times the same ticket. After my card got rejected on the fourth attempt I realized that they have been charging my card each time. I had to increase my card limit and top up big time to book a fourth time over the phone with an agent. What follows is a nightmare. Extremely difficult to get the failed bookings payments removed from my card. Took very long (still not over) with all the impacts you can imagine on using my card for any other expenses Singapore airlines proposed to give me 2000 miles for the inconvenience which I refused. This was an amazingly cheap offer for the tens of hours spent over the phone with them, with my bank, organizing conference calls, managing my credit card failed payments and all the emotional impacts this all triggers. Singapore airlines, you are too greedy. Now I understand why in 15 years being with you as a PPS and gold member I have never been upgraded. I will try other airlines.","negative"

But we headed to the lounge... and the best part was that they were serving Japanese Kare rice!! It was perfect for us as we didn't get to have it during our stay in Nagoya. The seats were very comfortable as usual; We are also now aware that the seats have a slightly different alternating combination; odd numbered centre seats are separated by a bulky storage compartment... The even numbered seats have the storage compartment nearer the aisles, so couples can sit side by side. Similarly, odd numbered window seats are closer to the windows, while even numbered window seats have the storage compartments against the window, so that you have to lean a little more to look out the window. Loved the graduating tinted windows of the Boeing 787 in place of the regular window shades. The food was average, as with many SQ flights, even when you think you can't really go wrong with the Japanese meal option... Service was excellent as usual; as well as the inflight entertainment.","positive"

Unless you know the 12 digit code of your flight which doesn't appear on your e-ticket you are in trouble as the out-of-hour ""bots"" are not really helpful .We had to phone the London office to get our problem sorted which they did do.We tried to log-in before our last flight but it said we had unallocated seats and all were taken but the Humans came to rescue!!","positive"
"5127","Good service As always fly with SQ is well known for their excellent full service (meals onboard and entertainment). Perhaps on last flight (at night)is not the luckiest time from me. From jakarta I got delayed for 1 hour due to bad weather in singapore, then it cut off my time for transit. And the flight to Melbourne from S'pore is really full and a little bit crowded, many baby's were crying all night.","positive"
"5986","Don't miss your flight on this airline We had purchased 2 tickets plus bought 20 KG baggage allowance for $130.31 to fly from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore. This was late 2018. Instead of 14.50, I read 4:50 for departure time and we ended up missing our flight. We were not able to purchase tickets at the airport and had to do it on our phone. Unfortunately I kept getting stuck and in the end had to ask for help from one of the women behind the counter. She booked our flight and it cost us $614. This was the same itinerary, just 2 hours later! A grave mistake that we paid dearly for!! But I don't think I'll ever choose to fly Singapore air again.","negative"
"7803","The most convenient way of traveling from the middle of Britain to NZ The journey is the least stressful way of traveling to South Island as if you chose a flight which doesn’t stop between Manchester and Singapore. It has. additional advantage if you take the 1100 flight from Manchester you arrive at Singapore at bedtime GMT. Because there is 12 hours between flights you can have a decent sleep in the Transit Hotel in Terminal 3 without leaving the airport. On the return journey it isn’t quite as good as usually there is usually only 7 hours between flights. This is my 19th annual visit to NZ","positive"
"11405","Hong Kong to Singapore. I have travelled on Singapore Airlines B777-200 on the last segment of my trip. The aircraft was old the inflight entertainment system is poor and the seat is also old. I was quite surprised to see that Singapore Airlines is still flying with this old thing. Food was just acceptable but nothing special. The meal service (dinner) was very late. This keeps you awake for most of the flight waiting for the dinner and just fall to sleep a few minutes before arrival.","negative"

"3494","Old aircraft, average food but consistency good in-flight service! To start off with and lay the context, I must admit that I am a fan of the airlines and every trip I take, I will surely fly with it. Every year, on average, I make 4-5 trips, usually 2 long hual, 1 medium and 1-2 short haul flights. In my most recent flight experience with it, my family and I went to Ho Chi Minh City for a short get-away holiday, the city we will go at least once annually. Instead of using an Airbus A330-300 aircraft as usual, it was actually a Boeing 777-200 aircraft (6th Sep, SQ184). This is one of the older aircraft and the airline already have plans to gradually phase it out in the next 1-2 years. The seating plan was 3-3-3. Seat and legroom was generally ok. The aircraft was very much dated and the inflight-entertainment was also very old (non-touch screen unlike the A350) and very insensitive control too. Loading was slow as well. As for the food, it was average and passable and I remembered my previous trips on the same flight (in December 2018), it was much better and tastier. The food was bland (the fish). For the service, it was great and compliments must be given to the pilots and crew. The flight was smooth and on time. The crew were attentive and courteous and for this, they ""saved"" the day of the flight and it was almost a full flight with many students! Fortunately, this flight was just an hour and 45 mins but I remembered the ""horrific"" flight I took, again in Boeing 777-200, back to Singapoe from Copenhagen in 2017. Imagine with the poor and unresponsive inflight system, it was tough to pull through over 12 hours in the air. However, on our return trip, it was an Airbus A330-300 which was a good relief for us. Although it was a full flight, it was a great experience and arrived much earlier than the scheduled arrival time! I hope my next coming flight with SQ in December will be a good one! Finger crossed.","neutral"
"7112","Watch your weight My wife and I recently flew to Stockholm on Singapore Airlines code share with SAS to celebrate Christmas and took along with a lot of presents for the family. In all our four bags weighed 96kg. We thought this was ok working on the normal SAS business class allowance of 2 x 32kg. However the leg Sydney to Singapore was under an SIA flight number rather than SAS and SIA has a weight allowance of just 40 kg each. This took some frantic repacking at the airport to squeeze under the limit. Incongruously coming back the other direction all the way to Sydney our bags could weigh 2 x 32kg under the flight rules. This would seem to be an anomaly that needs fixing.","positive"

Even though I had a meal the crew still asked if I wanted to have something to eat for breakfast before we landed. Awesome service Singapore Airlines!","positive"

Comfort for other passengers with legs should be considered. Hopefully I will not fly with them again.","negative"
"10181","I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided.","negative"

The seats were somewhat more spacious but not that much more as in the economy class. We sat in the middle on the fourseats row. Because we sat on the last row the chairs had less space than the other rows. The food was not bad. The staff was not very friendly, a little bit moody I would say. At the return flight we sat on the row with two seats. That was somewhat better. The flight attendants were doing their jobs, and that was it. Overall I would not choose for this airline again, there are better airlines with better prices.","neutral"

The seat although wide is not particularly comfortable in the seated position. The fully reclined position was better but the bed was hard. They would do well to add a comforter on the sleeping surface to provide a softer experience. They used to provide an amenities kit- no longer. The food too was just not as good as it used to be. If they want to retain their ratings they better spend a bit more on their business class product.","neutral"

The cabin crew is EXCELLENT! I highly appreciate their professionalism, their dedication to provide the highest level of passanger experience. In-flight meals are also of high quality and great taste. The price of this airline is fair for the quality of the service they provide.

"9253","Excellent choice when flying This airline has put itself head and shoulders above every other airline I’ve used; from the reasonable cost for a direct flight (paid about $600) to the value for your money - it’s downright unbeatable. For that low price you get to check 2 bags and one carryon (most other airlines charge more for just the flight and then make you pay extra for the luggage), EXCELLENT service on board (very friendly staff, great food and lots of it, very comfortable seats, excellent in-flight entertainment with your own personal screen and choice of movies, video games, music and if you wish you can synchronize with your phone). In-flight WiFi is available for purchase (think about $20) and is actually a pretty good connection. I still have no idea how they do it or if the other airlines are even aware of them or trying to be competitive. It’s also one of the few direct flights for this route - most others have at least one stopover. Highly recommend this Airline to anyone flying this route.","positive"
"3478","SQ air crew does not know the A380 plane well enough Caught an early morning flight SQ2171/LH983 @ 05:55AM from Dublin to Frankfurt. At Frankfurt, after scanning my boarding pass at the gate hold area, I was informed by the ground grew to head up the stairs and turn left from my flight SQ25 back home - Singapore. Proceeded as instructed and only realized at the door of the plane that it was the upper deck. So I politely told the SQ air crew that my seat is on the lower deck of the A380 and I was directed wrongly by the ground crew. I then requested if I could use the stairs to get to the lower deck. The SQ air crew informed me that there are no stairs and not possible to get from the upper deck to the lower deck within the plane. He then said I had to go all the way back to gate hold area and head to the lower deck. As I did not want to cause a scene nor argue with the air crew (even though I am 100% sure there are stairs within the plane connecting the upper and lower decks), I made my way back to the gate hold area and then to the lower deck and got seated. I then requested to speak to the IFS once we are airborne. When the IFS came, I explained the above experience to him. The IFS was also shocked that the air crew did not just let me use the stairs. The IFS was very apologetic and offer to be of personal assistance to me during the flight - offering red wine from business class etc. which I decline. I explained to the IFS that what I hope for, is that air crew does not make the same mistake in explaining to passengers. If there was a boarding regulations or safety concerns for using the stairs then just explain it clearly. Rather than trying to hoodwink passengers by saying there are no stairs. Passengers are not dumb. There folks who does not want to cause a commotion and rather take the extra effort. So do not think that passengers are flying for the first time on A380 - especially your frequent flyers. Hope SQ learn from this and share with other air crews. Thanks!","neutral"
"5642","Well oiled machine. Singapore Airlines have the customer service aspect down to a fine art. Hot towels for economy passengers are a bit of a rarity as are printed menus. The plane on this leg was a rather tired 777. Attentive staff constantly offered water and juice through the trip and there was a snack bar to help yourself from down the back of the plane. I was surprised by the excellent quality of the food. I wasn't expecting much from economy class food but it was really tasty. Very bravely, they served Brocolli as part of a starter and it was perfectly cooked. Even when I cook Broccoli it's tough or mushy. They also have cracked serving bread that is edible. Economy travel on 11 hour flights is more of an endurance test that a pleasure but Singapore does its best to make the experience as painless as possible.","positive"

The Singapore to Rome flight was on an Airbus A350. This was my first experience of this type of aircraft and I was much impressed. It was comfortable and spacious even in Economy. My son is over 6 feet tall and he found it comfortable. WELL DONE SINGAPORE AIRLINES. The seats felt a little thin in the padding, but were comfortable and with a bit of a walk around occasionally did not fatigue you at all. The entertainment system as always was varied and easy to use. Headphones I would suggest you take your own, particularly on a long haul flight. Service was excellent as always. What more can I say.","positive"

"7482","Arrogance at its Finest Probably the worst airline experience I’ve ever had thus far after maybe 5,000 hours of flying experience. My first and definitely my last time flying Singapore airlines. Despite its reputation as a high flyer, Singapore airlines certainly did not live up to its reputation. While the hard product is quite good, the service was abysmal, and could only be described as self entitled and arrogant. Perhaps SIA should stop offering economy class tickets and only service its business class customers since all the glowing reviews seem to be about the business class product. I, for one, will from now on certainly pay a premium NOT to fly Singapore airlines again.","negative"
"7481","Seat Seat wasn’t as comfortable as hoped for. Though there were seat recline and foot extension features, we somehow couldn’t get into a comfortable position. But since it was a red eye fl, I slept through most of the 6 hours flight. The gaps behind the seat caused some small items I placed on my seat to drop down to the areas below the passenger behind. I could only retrieve my items once we landed and parked. One disappointment for my daughter was that, though there was larger leg room near the emergency exit door, the entertainment screen was rather far from from the seat as they were mounted on the wall panel. The food was alright, flight was smooth and service was polite and adequate.","neutral"

"8048","Generally good, still room for improvement I used Singapore Airlines this time flying from Hong Kong to Perth and return. The outbound leg: departure delayed by 25 minutes, plane actually took off an hour after the scheduled departure time. Arrival time delayed by 20 minutes, shortening my transit time to 60 minutes. Luckily the transfer was within the same terminal. Inbound leg: I was surprised that being Singapore Airlines, they used a gate (A6) at T3 (for Singapore to HK) which necessitated walking down a flight of steps (no escalator or elevator), for transfer on a shuttle bus to get to the plane. This is unsatisfactory, if you need to walk with assistance or are pushing a pram. The meals are still good (Economy Class). The S$20 transit voucher is generous. However, the in-flight entertainment and in-flight magazine are not as good as those on Qatar Airways, in my opinion. No free wifi for Economy Class.(Compare again: Qatar Airways provides free wifi for 30 minutes for Economy Class). As for Changi Airport: the carpeted floor is not good for wheels (suitcases, trolleys, prams, etc. this has been my impression since I used the airport many years ago); the arrangement whereby you need to show your passport to register to get a password for using wifi is super unfriendly (this has been in place for ages for as long as I could remember). I have not used another airport which requires such cumbersome control in the name of security. Think again, Changi Airport.","positive"
"335","Most disappointing Used to be a big fan of the airline till they screwed up one time too many. To be sure, the actual service on the flight is great, but the lead up to it is anything but. The website is slow. The customer service representatives do not respond to emails at all. The people on the chatbot are not very useful. With my latest trip, I just found out that after confirming my seat, that was cancelled and I now have to book another seat that is in a worse location. Yet the airline can't offer any satisfactory explanation. For an airline that is charging a serious premium over its peers, this is unacceptable.

They were sent to the back to the amusement of other passengers. The flight was fantastic, the staff could do no more and every request was greeted with a smile and fantasic service. Nothing was to much trouble and the service is so subtle, it works amazinly well. The seat was comfortable and so well designed to allow free movement and the ability to change seating positions and angles.

"8411","Flight Experience Was Great But The In-Flight Entertainment System Could Definitely Be Improved Firstly, I'd like to say, Singapore Airlines is a great airline. No doubt about that. The cabin crew were extremely hospitable and friendly and always ready to assist me and my friends (we were on a school trip to Phuket). For a fact, I know that different planes in your fleet are somewhat different in their own ways. For example, the size of a TV screen on the newest Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 777-300 will definitely not be the same. On my flight SQ955 from Jakarta to Singapore, I sat on a Boeing 777-300 (the original version, without the 'ER'). The TV screen size was unbelievably small (I could've sworn, my iPad was bigger than that screen). The navigation system was sub-par (no touch-screen) and somewhat unresponsive. Additionally, as one of the world's very best airlines, one would expect more than a pair of earbuds. Even Malaysia Airlines provides decent quality headphones, and certainly a bigger screen with better resolution (yes, I hope that gives a perspective of how small the screen was). So, I think I'm don.... ONE MORE THING. Singapore Airlines, where is the in-flight charging port?! A five-star airline, without a charging port?! I spent ten minutes looking for a charging port that was never even there! Really unacceptable, if you ask me, for an airline with such an excellent reputation. So, top tip. Next time when you're booking a Singapore Airlines flight, check the type of plane they use on that route. Use a flight tracking system (flightradar24, flightaware.com). For example, you're looking for a morning flight on the Jakarta - Singapore route. You see two suitable flights - SQ955 and SQ957. However, there's a massive difference between those two flights. SQ955 uses the old Boeing 777-300; SQ957 uses the brand-new Airbus A350-900. I bet you know which flight to choose now!","neutral"

Carrots you could not cut with a serrated knife, broccoli brown and over cooked, pasta undercooked: hard and powdery, Some sort of muffin which was very stale... Suggest SA take a trip in Air New Zealand Premium Economy to see how it should be. The 777 aircraft had only 4 toilets none of which were located near the premium economy seats. The inflight entertainment whilst had over 300 titles it seems most were B film and unheard of. The cabin staff announcements over the PA were inaudible which could be dangerous in some circumstance. It should be said that the cabin crew were courteous and the seats were reasonably comfortable. However I cannot see how SA can justify the considerable hike in price and then serve up unedible food. If you have to travel suggest you at least only go economy to get the same poor quality","neutral"
"3209","Great Service We have 6 members of family with 2 child 1 infent and 1 senior citizen to avail singapore airlines while travel to Malaysia. The mentionable good things are 1. Cabin crue are extremly supportable. 2. They are taken care of child and todler nicely. 3. Food standard is good 4. Time conscious and good management. Negative side: May be from Bangladesh they are not using upgraded Plane so that we feel so jerking sometime without bad weather. Overall it was agreat journey in both return way.","positive"
"5492","Best Airline! We have flown for over 15 hours with this airline. Lots of food and unlimited amounts of drinks was provided.

"10988","Amsterdam to Singapore. I was looking forward to fly the A350. After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews. The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level. Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that. Customer service was good (not exceptional) and the meals were delicious. One of the best meals ever had on a plane. I appreciate the metal cutlery and hot towel cloths. Overall, it was a great flight and I am looking forward to the next one! And I made my connection flight (which was very tight) thanks to the very efficient airport of Changi.","positive"
"10305","I flew with Singapore Airlines from London on a 11.30am local time arriving in Singapore 7.30am local time next day. For some unknown reason this airline serves breakfast at 1.45am Singapore time. I and other passengers were woken up so we could have a breakfast. Once breakfast was finished we still had 5 more hours of flying time. How stupid is this. Dreading my flight home. I have travelled with this airline in the past but it now is on a par with a low cost airline. Very disappointed.","negative"
"6031","It was OK, but not so great No snack was served from KUL to SIN during this 1 hr flight. Then waited 2 hrs for connecting flight, only a small sandwich was served after boarding. Full breakfast was served only before landing. Seat was not so comfortable, quite narrow than imagine. Service was OK, not great. First time flying SQ economy, flew on SQ J class before, service level is not comparable.","neutral"
"3244","Best Service By Far Singapore staff are truly amazing. Service and food is the best. Leg room and comfort vary from plane to plane as the are not all the same A380 and A350 are great planes for economy. More room. The Boeing 777-300ER is very squeezy for long haul in economy. Staff are still exemplary though. Will be traveling with this airline in the future 100%","positive"
"9445","Disappointing flights We were disappointed with our Flight from Melbourne to Barcelona and return. The food was only average, we were not given a travel pack, only socks and eye shade and the seats were not very comfortable. We felt we were not treated any differently from economy class passengers- needing to ask for help to set up our bed - which was not easy. The bed was very uncomfortable and you had to lie at an angle as the section for your feet is set off to one side. When we arrived home we had very sore hips and backs from the poorly designed bed. The other complaint we had was that the Business Class lounge at Barcelona was appalling - overcrowded, worn out seating and very little food. It was a shared lounge and was full of Flight staff and their luggage! We did write to the airline with our issues and they responded quickly and offered us vouchers to spend at their at their Flight shop - which we appreciated.","neutral"
"7167","Best airline in my view! I have travelled several times to Australia with this airline and on every occasion the service has been exemplary. The cabin staff are polite courteous friendly and efficient. The choices of food are reasonable considering they have to cater for a wide variety of tastes. The airline is also very reasonable on pricing compared with other airlines. I will definitely use them again.","positive"
"841","Best flight ever! I had some issues getting checked in for my flight and could not be happier with the service I received at ticketing. Betsy, Deborah, and especially Marybelle were all so patient and helped me get everything sorted out. They were professional and friendly while I waited to find out if I could board the flight first to Singapore, then to Bali. I wish all airlines had employees like these ladies - I will only chose Singapore Airlines any time it is an option in the future. The aircraft was very nice, and the flight attendants were all amazing. Even though I was in economy, I was able to rest comfortably, and the food was good. Great choices of in-flight entertainment as well.","positive"
"9685","Singapore Airlines - Meal Options for Economy Class Not Available Dear Customer Care Team of Singapore Airlines, I have travelled many a times through your Airlines and always had a feeling that it is one of the best Airlines I am travelling in terms of everything including on flight amenities. However, this time I noticed that the option to select meal has been withdrawn for Y Class travellers. May be this is one of the austerity measure to control cost. In my view, the meal option should be restored and travellers be given opportunity to select their meal choices before they board on to the flights because : a) One feels bad and dejected when someone notices that meal options are available for Business Class and Premium Economy Class but not for the Economy Class b) More than 90% passengers travel in economy class and one should not (rather can not) afford to displease the major customer base by numbers c) Major top line revenue comes to any airlines comes from this segment d) Any drop in revenue in this segment will have major proportionate impact on the bottom line of the company e) In any case you are providing meals in the flight so giving an option would not have major impact on cost cutting. To keep the cost under control you may reduce the options to Veg vs Non Veg ONLY without giving them more options with each category. Some of the veg customers may find it difficult to have anything in sectors not touching India where Veg options in flight are very limited to do not exist at all. Hope this will be taken seriously by the management of Singapore Airlines. Look forward to your rely. Tarun Kalra","neutral"
"2898","MORE THAN A FIVE STAR AIRLINE Had not flew with Singapore Airlines for some years. Recently flew SQ to Nagoya and back via Tokyo. Service was superb.

"10188","I use Singapore Airlines a lot so obviously like the airline, and having Gold Frequent filer status does help when flying economy. fast track check in and lounge access to make things a bit smoother. I fly economy on Singapore Airlines but this was the first time in economy on a SQ long haul flight for about 6 years. Boarding was fine, quickly to my seat 45A, departed a little late but once in the air for around 1 hour service was started. Crew where okay food served quickly and again nothing special just okay. The flight lasting 12 hours passed fairly quick, I found the seats a bit uncomfortable after 4 or 5 hours, the crew where around a little bit and the 2nd meal served 3 hours prior to arrival was okay. Connecting to Bangkok pretty easy and the 2 hour uneventful flight on a new 787 was pretty nice. Returning Check in at Bangkok was quick security and immigration done quickly too, used the Krisflier lounge which was pretty nice, the flight to SIN I was seated in seat 42A, food and drinks where offered but the crew after requesting my choice forgot to deliver the food or a drink, It was a bit odd and the crew on this flight where actually a bit rude anyway. Connection in SIN good again, my flight back to London in Premium Economy, so a chance to compare. Yes of course we are paying for the space, but food and crew are the same as economy. Premium Economy wise I think SQ is okay, I will continue to use, because it's normally consistent but there are better and much cheaper Premium Economy options around.","neutral"
"3156","Disappointing We flew the Singapore Business Class from Zurich to Singapore. We were really disappointed about the service. We were sitting on the D an F seats and we eat separately. The D row was always served faster than the F row. It disturbed us very much. Additionally the toilets were very dirty and bad smelling. We could not understand. The food was nice. The flight attendants were not friendly all the time, seemed to be stressed!","neutral"

"2422","Long trip home Very professional airline. On time and smooth service (announcements, food, etc). However, this is my second trip with this airline where I felt that the air hostesses were giving us the economy service. On a 10 hour flight, surely you don't have to rush me with my food and drinks? A few times I was also asked why I had called for service (in a slightly rushed manner) when the call was from someone two seats down the row. Just felt ""economical"" with their ""friendly"" service. On board entertainment is super with lots of options of movies/TV/books/games. Kids were kept entertained. Good flight and well managed.","positive"

"27","Not Happy Singapore Air we,have travelled with sq many times , and always have excellent service until this last one on 14 February. My husband had booked the cook , and ordered steak, which had blooded pouring out of it when he got it. He complained to the FA, and it was taken away for about 10 minuites and then returned to him in much the same condition.The only other thing they could offer him was 3 tiny pieces of chicken in horrendously hot sauce, that he couldnt eat. He ended up with a couple of crackers and a slice of cheese, this was his business class meal. I had some chicken satee , which tasted fine , until 10 minutes later I was very sick, spent some time in the toilet. Had to ring several times before our male FA answered the call button. These flights cost $10000.00, so not happy jan.","negative"
"11515","Recently returned from Melbourne via Singapore. The seat on the trip from Singapore to Manchester was really uncomfortable as a result I have a bruised coccyx which is still painful.

"5708","I had hoped for a better experience I appreciate that i only flew economy so shouldn't expect too much. I did pay for extra legroom seats but this also meant that there was nowhere to put those bits and bobs you need nearby. The fold out TV screen bracket was also broken. The Flight attendant kindly stuck it all together with bits of card and sticking plasters, but then I was stuck with it for the 13 hour trip. The crew were helpful and friendly enough but the aircraft was just tatty, tired, and broken. So not 'good', not 'bad' but decidedly 'average'. I have used Emirates three times prior to this flight, and was very impressed with them.","neutral"

Travelling with us was our 13 year old son and the crew made him feel valued yet not condescending to him at all. The seats were comfortable and had enough leg room to endure the 8 hours to our destination. The in flight entertainment unit was glitchy in parts but worked mostly so if you wanted to watch or play it kept you amused.Food was satisfactory but brilliant and not horrible but served he purpose. Overall would be more than happy to fly with them again.","positive"

I fell asleep even before take-off and then woke up after to set my seat flat.

I will definitely fly Singapore again - although I am not sure if business class is worth the short trip.","positive"

Great service by friendly staff. Was a bit disappointed when our 2 prebooked economy seats upstairs in the a380 was unexpected downgraded downstairs due to ‘change in aircraft’. The a380’s are starting to show their age especially with the seats, entertainment etc. Was quite pleased with the Old Chang Kee chicken curry puffs! Would definitely fly again with SIA but other airlines have lifted their game in terms of newer aircraft, price competitive, premium economy/business class options and service","positive"
"971","Terrible customer service / no response Purchased business class LAX- Singaore - they canceled flight 5 months in advance- rebooked us with a 27 hour layover. To get on a flight on the correct dates they put us in coach- without offering a refund for downgrade of service. finally 6 months later- after over 30 hours on hold received a whopping $352 credit- This review is based on their lack of response and basically stating at the gate I was lucky to be going to the maldives at all. Our friend who we booked with had to fly in a day early after being dropped by airline completely....so maybe we were lucky.","negative"
"18","Nothing special. I'd heard many good things about Singapore Airlines so was looking forward to travelling with them but was sadly disappointed. We flew economy in a 777 and although we paid for extra leg room it still felt very cramped. The seat was so uncomfortable, the noisyest flight I can recall ment there was no chance of being able to grab a couple of hours sleep but the worst thing for me was the entertainment screen was not working despite 2 resets I was left staring at the bulkhead for 13 and a half hours. The lead stewardess took my E mail address and promised compensation for the broken screen but a week on an I've heard nothing from them. Hardly one of the world's best airlines I'm afraid.","neutral"

"11485","LHR-SIN-SYD and return. A380 for the first and third legs B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble which is trivial is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.","positive"
"5422","Best Airline by far Flight from Brisbane to Singapore was great with excellent service from all staff (far exceeds Emirates who we flew with last year). Our flight from Singapore to Bangkok had a hiccup when the aircraft had to be replaced. We were fully informed by staff and each were given a snack pack whilst we waited for the new aircraft. The thing is they were honest and kept us up to date frequently. Well done Singapore Air.","positive"
"2806","Great entertainment. Service excellent. Food so-so. As always, SQ never fails to disappoint in terms of flight efficiency and outstanding service standards. The air stewardess serving our row is clearly still a newbie, guided and assisted by several senior staffs throughout the flight service. Although nervous and made a few clumsy mistakes, she was very sincere and hardworking. The calm and helpfulness of her senior colleagues were also heart-warming to see. Taste of food has declined over the years with SQ, so was not expecting much.","positive"
"241","2hr delay We had a 2hr delay for a flight which caused a different linked flight and we couldn’t choose our own seats. We paid fir the choosing of own seats but when we tried to complain about it got no where. The 2hr delay meant it was over lunch time and all they offered was $14aus (£7) for refreshments not lunch. It which was not enough to cover lunch at airport prices so not good enough Singapore Airlines. Will not fly with them again. Wifi was at a cost too.","negative"
"3349",""" SINGAPOOR"" Dont Fly Singapore if you are Coeliac or want to use the club lounge Having flown many airlines the expectation was high that Singapore would live up to the hype, they failed on all fronts, First despite having checked when we joined, before we left and whilst we were away that access was available we were not allowed into the Kriss lounge at Heathrow as we were not Gold, but assured yes you can use the one in Singapore, Not the case. ""Meals"" thats a joke if you are a coeliac, refer to the picuture of what was actually provided vs the claimed menu as provided by Singapore airlines. As I don't drink alcohol it was necessary to chase up a soft drink as nothing was supplied at the time of the meal. Surely they could have supplied some rice or something for the flight. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST • Fruit Appetiser: Seasonal fruit. • A portion of margarine • Diabetic jam • Non-dairy creamer • Sugar DINNER • Hors D'oeuvre: Buckwheat salad, canned pear slices, sliced roasted chicken thigh and shaved pink radish • Main course: Beef, thyme and onion stew, roasted rough cut potato, roasted pumpkin and sautéed peas and onion • Dessert: Exotic puree with lemon verbena jelly and poach pineapple with lemon verbena. Finally the Seating was not cleaned properly rubbish in the seat pockets and food left on the seat from previous flight. Still waiting for some clarrification from Singapore as to the menu fail. Sorry but very disappointed in the flight and treatment of issues raised.","negative"

It was a flight en route to Delhi, for a lifetime travel experience, The only reason I got to meet my connecting trip in Delhi was because of my persistence in insisting I got to Auckland before the end of the day. Rebooking was shambolic with 2 personnel organising 200 passengers rebooking. It was inefficient, impersonal, unprofessional and incredibly stressful. A giant fail for Singapore airlines followup procedures when things go wrong from me. I will never fly with you again!!!","negative"
"3971","Holiday We have travelled with Singapore Airlines in the past and found the service impeccable. We flew Singapore Airlines to Singapore and then SilkAir from Singapore to Male. These legs of our journey were very good and we couldn’t fault them. The service coming back to Singapore from Male was good even though we were experiencing turbulence, the flight attendants were still able to give us a meal and plenty of drinks. It all unraveled once we boarded in Singapore to come back to Sydney. Our seats were fine it was just the service. We declined the meal and I wasn’t even offered a drink, ever again. When we woke for breakfast by the time they got to us there wasn’t anything eatable left. The people beside us couldn’t even eat theirs. This is so unlike the airline we have flown with before. I was able to get an OJ, thankfully. I will be hesitant to fly with them again the service was terrible.","negative"

"5868","Travelling with a wedding dress & honeymoon treat Top tip for flying with your wedding dress: Before flying to NZ from the UK, I tried many times to get a clear answer from Singapore Airlines about the best way to take my dress on board (obviously not going to put it in my checked luggage!), with all answers being vague and with no guarantee that dresses can be hung in the cabin. In the end I bought a special wedding dress box which fit Singapore's carry-on dimensions (must be 115cm or less in total), but the total weight of the box + dress was over the 7kg limit. So I ended up carefully stuffing my dress into a small carry-on sized suitcase and it was just fine. Wrapped in tissue paper and plastic, there weren't even many wrinkles when I opened it. Another top tip: if you're on your honeymoon, let your travel agent know and you may get a lovely treat like we did! A couple of Singapore Slings and some chocolate cake were a lovely way to end our very long flight back to the UK.","positive"

As regular 1st Class travelers, my wife and I would not dream of flying with anyone else. The 777 flight Auckland to Changi is OK, the private room is a bonus while we wait for our next flight to Paris CDG on SQ's A380. The suites and service 'WERE' incomparable. Mid Covid (June 2020). The A350 used on the Changi - CDG leg was frankly a disgrace. It was old, tatty and dirty. The crew were at their usual best. The seat was uncomfortable and in need of new upholstery. This aircraft was a salute lesson on how to disappoint a customer. However, we blame Covid. Post Covid (June 2021 and 22). Same awful aircraft, nothing has changed. Crew are still superb though. The purser on board whispers to me that lots of passengers are complaining. Post Covid (June 2023) We have booked on Emirates A380. NZD18K each. These fares are insane. At least we're not an old clunker that needs to be retired.","negative"

We then flew Singapore to Doha on Qatar Airways new A350-900 and from Doha to Cape Town on Qatar Airways Boeing 787-800. Seating comfort on their B777-200ER was better than the Boeing 787-800.

"8672","Singapore airlines all the way Having flown Singapore airlines before and being impressed we decided, for such a long trip from Perth to Rome and then our return leg from Paris to Perth via Singapore in both directions we decided to fly with them again. A decision we glad we made. The service, food, flight itself and the experience of new planes, such as the 380 was fantastic. They are so much quieter and this helped me as I am not a good flyer. One good recommendation if you are not a good flyer is to have a couple of days break somewhere on the way to your destination and on the way back if it is a long trip such as this. We did this coming back by stopping in Singapore on the way home and it was perfect but going to our destination we didnt and it was a bit too long if you are not a good flyer. The inflight service and entertainmemt was great with lots of choices of movies, music, kids stuff, games and comedy or TV programs. Overall the experience of flying with Singapore Airlines was fantastic and one we would always do for such long trips again. Excellent.","positive"

The calf rest is useless if the seat in front reclines which also means leaving your seat requires a limbo manouvre. We had book the cook but the food was not good. Regular food lookd better. 1.5 hr change in Singapore is a long, long, long walk. Shall have assistance on return. Singapore to Sydney was very old, very worn Boeing 777. Had to go through Economy to washrooms which was a long walk through narrow aisles on a very bumpy flight. So many people using washrooms meant they became untidy. The seats were not comfortable, calf rests useless as on earlier flight. Seat pockets in front were broken and exposing sharp metal fixings. Stewards on both legs were helpful and very pleasant. I do not think we got Premium on the second leg, felt very let down. Would definitely not do Singapore Air 777 again. Not sure I would even do Premium Economy for the 380. This is really NOT value for money.","positive"

"9575","This time it was quite disappointing- Old airline, old films Ma first Singapore experience is more than 10 years agor and was for a flight to New York. It was a great flight, service perfect and all modern and new. This time I was looking forward to a flight from Singapore to Frankfurt. Such long flight to be expected of similar experience. unfortunately I found an old plane with old technology. Service was still good but not as it once was. The flight with LH to Singapore was nicer. What a pitty. Image can be ruined quite quickly.","neutral"
"11344","Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland return Nov/Dec 2014. All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.","positive"
"10105","My baggage was delayed on both my onward and return flights. I requested compensation for my trip to Kochi, as I had to purchase clothes and toiletries. However, I was only offered AUD 50.

"6307","Premium Economy? More Economy than Premium Ok, I'm not expecting Business Class for the cost of Premium Economy but apart from the very welcome extra seat width and pitch very litlle else seem to be offered. Check in was poor. We were unable to check in on-line as an 'Air New Zealand' customer so we got to the airport early. The ONLY seats left were two centre seats which is always a pain as you have to climb over someone else to get out. Someone has to have them but when I asked how to check in early to book a seat (which presumably others had done) I was given a blank look by the staff. Cabin staff are excellent and faultless. They did their very best. A glass of water in a plastic beaker was offerred after the plane took off (no sparkling wine as others) Food appeared to be same as economy and was served with plastic cutlery and 'glasses' (water in a pot with peel back foil lid that spills as you pull to open). Drinks were adequate but again appeared to be the same trolley as economy. A 14 hr flight is never too enjoyable but the Premium Economy service was well below that offered by both Virgin and Air New Zealand (which we thought was excellent) Am I expecting too much? Perhaps, but Premium Economy was well over twice the price of economy and in this instance just not worth it. I had always believed Singapore to be about the best around. This was not my experience.","neutral"
"8200","Great seats. Great Service. This is an early morning Airbus 330 taking passengers from Changi to Perth. We left from a small enclave in Terminal B that houses gates B1-B4 behind an additional security check. Leave time for that. Once you are inside the enclave there is only a very limited cafe for food. Flight was delayed due to weather. Seats have lots of storage areas. They offered a wide selection of magazine and newspapers to read. Breakfast was served.","positive"
"8699","Wow not what I expected We normally fly Virgin or an American company when we fly to the states. I was sceptical when I saw the flights to Houston, non stop flights for 2 at £760 for 2 in economy. You get 23kg allowance per passenger, also a piece of hand luggage each with no extra charge. Flights to Orlando were coming up at £1200 on cheaper airlines done a gave it a shot. Wow I was really surprised by how good it was. It's obviously not a massive tourist destination but both there and back we had no one also on our row of 3 so we could stretch out. Seats were quite comfy for economy and I did not feel like a sardine. Sat up right with both legs together and forward I would say I had around 3 to 5 inches distance from my knees to the back of the seat in front. Each seat has it's own seat back entertainment system. This has games, music, TV and a large range of movies from Hollwood, latest releases, indie, foreign and subtitled. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout and genuinely were happy to help. The plane was modern and clean also. The service they provided could not be faulted, the drinks service was spot on and came round several times during the flight. You were given snacks, and we got at least 2 full meals in the flight. The food was very nice also, your given a menu and 3 options to choose from. I could not fault the flights or service at all, it as on a par if not better than Virgin. I will definitely use them again.","positive"
"8910","Premium economy Recently flew premium economy from Dubai to Auckland via Singapore with the 2nd sector operated by Air NZ in premium economy. I had high expectations that were not met. Narrow hard seats that had slippery leather so pillow kept slipping when trying to sleep. Food was ok just a normal economy tray. Air NZ experience far better and it had own canin with private lavatories unlike Singapore airlines you had to share with economy class. It not worth flying premium on DIS just fly normal economy as there are no real perks","neutral"
"11165","Singapore to Melbourne, and the plane I took seems like it is older than others in Singapore Airlines fleet and the seats were a bit more spacious. All the cabin crew were nice but since I was taking a midnight flight, you would hardly see cabin crew talking to passengers or walking past. There is not a lot of choices on the inflight entertainment, but overall, the flight was pleasant.","positive"
"957","Pack a lunch for business class or go hungry Although Singapore Airlines has a great reputation our experience was not particularly impressive in a good way. We flew business class. The pod was ok for sleeping but if you are tall, the angle is a bit awkward for one’s feet. I was more comfortable on Lufthansa business class and United’s Polaris. However, we starved. The food we were served was tasty but inadequate for a 19 hour flight. We were served dinner shortly after taking off and then another meal about half way through the flight but on the way over were then given just a small package of Oreo cookies. On the way back when I woke from a nap I saw other passengers in business class eating sandwiches with some bags of chips but when I asked for a sandwich I was told there weren’t any and was offered a small bag of nuts. That was it for the 9 + hours since our mid flight meal which is really skimpy especially given what we paid for the ticket. The airline couldn’t spare another few dollars for a sandwich? Even in economy United serves a sandwich a few hours before landing on a flight that long. I will say though that they handled their baggage glitch well. Although we were practically the first customers to check into the flight at JFK because we had a layover so our bags should have made the flight, for some reason they didn’t and after waiting at baggage claim in Singapore for our bags not to appear and we went to the baggage services office. As soon as we gave our name we were told that our bags were still at JFK and given some paperwork to complete- they had already prepared most of the form- along with some money to buy essentials. Apparently, the airline was well aware that the luggage was left behind and was prepared. Our bags were delivered the next day to our hotel. The airline did handle the baggage issue well but I never imagined I would have had to pack a lunch for business class. Also, although we had access to the airline club as is common when flying business or first class internationally we were only allowed in 2 hours before the flight which isn’t common. I’ve never had a time limitation before and that exacerbated our hunger because we didn’t have much time to eat during the limited time we had in the club and then had to leave to walk the gate to board. Our experience wasn’t awful and it is good to have a nonstop to Singapore but I’d select another airline for another route.","neutral"
"10870","Medium haul flight from Singapore to Bangkok. The plane was a rather dated B777. Nevertheless, the cabin was well maintained, and the seats were comfortable and offered sufficient legroom. The food was very tasty. However, I was most impressed with the service of the cabin staff. I was wearing a suit, and the flight attendant asked me whether he could put the suit jacket on a hanger, which has never happened to me with any other airline.","positive"

We called customer care, and they assured us the booking went through and we won't be charged. But at airport they denied any booking and again charged us for the bag and told us to sort out the issue with customer care. We called the customer care multiple times and everytime we have to describe the. exact same thing and they ask for receipt and documents. We upload and they assured us we will be refunded.

"3452","All good, except the food Thursday 19th September and our adventure in Lombok and Bali was coming to an end and the first leg of the long journey back to the UK was due to begin on board Singapore Airlines flight SQ949, from Bali to Changi Airport, Singapore. Our flight was due to depart at 21.45 arriving in Changi at 00.20, a scheduled flying time of 2 hours 35 minutes. We were airborne by 21.55. We were informed that the actual time would be 2 hours and 20 minutes flyingtime. We actually landed at 00.10, which was good news as our connecting flight to London was departing at 01.10. About 45 minutes into the flight food and drinks were served, the food option was fish and potatoes or chichen and rice. We opted for the chicken, it looked uappetising in fact it was disappointingly awful and was not eaten. The legroom was very good and the seats were comfortable and the Cabin Crew were attentive and charming. Both previous flights, outbound, with this Airline, were rated as excellent, sadly the food affected this rating.","positive"
"583","A major disappointment Having flown in from PER on a relatively short flight in a 787 we found ourselves in a decrepit A350 for a 7hour flight. AV was outdated, not intuitive & provided zero news channels & staff not very interested to find one. On the way from PER I was watching BBC News broadcast out of their Singapore studios ?? There was however a basic instruction clip for the seating so found the missing 787 armrest. Good food service, first hot meal of the day as breakfast out of PER was barely warm. BUT, a lousy wine selection to pair with my boeuf vigneron by George Blanc. No trace of a French vigneron red, except in the meal ! Just a Chianti & Barossa Shiraz for the reds & 2 whites. I had a better selection on QF BNE/PER !! What is the point of a G Blanc menu if you skimp on the wine ? Crew lightweight on product knowledge, no idea about G Blanc & not interested in the AV issues. It would appear adequate training is missing -- How the mighty have fallen !","neutral"

During this long flight these toilets were continually in use not only by business class but also economy class, and i was kept awake. I believe that these seats should not be offered as business class given there location. I would have rather spent the flight in economy class rather then being next to the toilets","negative"
"8213","Always a good and safe Airline SQ has a good record and that is why we fly it. Premium economy can be a little cramped but well worth the extra $$. My partner is gluten free and it seems if one has ""special"" dietary requirements they are sat in the front row. This is ideal as there is miles of leg room and no problems getting up for a stretch. And, the meal looked Ok to me ! The service is so much better than Qantas and not quite as good as Virgin. We fly Virgin to the US and SQ to London.","positive"

"3843","Vaping in Singapore/Changi Airport As an avid vapour I was worried about what to do once hitting Changi Airport as vaping is prohibited in Singapore. So here is how it works. I traveled from Auckland to Vietnam with a transit stop in Singapore for 3 hours and was panicking about my vape which was in my checked in baggage. This was not an issue but my plans had me coming back to Singapore for 3 days later in my travels - here's what I found out. While transiting you can carry your vape and use the smoking areas in the international terminals as long as you do not go through immigration. On my return to Singapore 2 weeks later I was going through immigration/customs so you can put your vape into baggage storage BEFORE going through immigration - in terminal 2 the baggage storage is behind Prada right beside the immigration gate and there is storage in every terminal. When I flew out I was going out of terminal 3 so I went through immigration at T2 picked up my stuff and headed over to T3 - easy peezy. You will either need to smoke cigarettes or use patches while in Singapore - I used nicotine lozenges which were no issue at all through customs. I was there late August 2019. Happy vaping...","positive"

"557","Cancelled our return flight, didn’t notify us and now refuse to refund us. While on holiday in NYC in December we logged on to choose seats for our return flight. When we entered our booking details the website responded that our flight had been cancelled. We checked our emails and text messages - nothing. My wife rang our booking agent who confirmed that Singapore Airlines had cancelled our flight. We asked for a booking on an equivalent premium economy flight on the same day, but we’re advised that none were available. After a lot of back and forth with the agent we were advised that there were seats available on a Scoot flight (Singapore Airline’s budget carrier). With no other options open to us and commitments back home we had to keep, we agreed and got home OK. Since then I have been chasing Singapore Airlines for a refund of the difference between a budget grade Scoot flight and the premium economy flight that we paid for, and perhaps an apology for cancelling our flight without notifying us. I have had no response. Airline says to take it up with the booking agent. Booking agent says it is the airline’s fault for cancelling the flight. Complaint has been referred to some third party called ‘Aunt Betty’ who seem to be some affiliate of Flight Centre. Singapore Airline’s premium economy service was poor. Conditions were cramped, food was terrible - nothing premium about it. Scoot was even worse - uncomfortable seats and no in flight entertainment. After sales service is non-existent, but they get a gold star for failure to communicate and for giving the runaround. Avoid at all costs!","negative"
"7270","Loved flying with them! This was the first time flying with Singapore Airlines, and it was a truly wonderful experience! From the time I was greeted at the aircraft door, to the service on a flight that was 18 hours long (first flight) to Singapore, the flight attendants were very attentive. It seemed that no request was too much. On long haul flights (or just short flights) I have never seen restrooms so clean and neat. This may seem like a strange remark, but I have seen restrooms that were in such a dreadful state by the end of the flight you didn't want to use them. These were kept clean and tidy which was really nice. Flying Premium Economy was a good experience. Having a calf rest and footrest made sitting for such a long flight somewhat more comfortable. To perhaps repeat myself, I loved flying with Singapore Airlines. It was easy changing gates in Singapore, and people were friendly, with a smile and a warm welcome. I look forward to flying with them again, and if you have the opportunity, fly with them. I don't think you will be disappointed, I wasn't!","positive"

We took a seat there because there were a lot of empty seats as opposed to the other side which was standing room only.

They just wanted to exert their authority at the expense of the customer.","neutral"

We took that offer and were offered a second night at half-price which we took. I fully recommend them.","positive"

Flight Attendant 'Alvin Chen' was playing with the baby to remind himself of his daughter of same age whom he was awaiting to see. Another flight attendant 'Summer' - (forgot her real name which is tough) always played and talked to the baby as she hopes to have a baby like her in future. Service was excellent. I did not experience the so called hierarchy culture of Singapore in that particular flight as crew was made to feel equal to their bosses.","positive"
"5576","Great Service as allways I recently flew with Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Denmark through Singapore return trip with my 4-year old. As it turned out, I got caught in the SAS pilot strike on a connecting flight when I had to return to Melbourne, and if it hadn't been for Singapore Airlines' brilliant customer service, I would have been stuck! Within 6 hours of emailing Singapore Airlines, I had a customer representative calling me offering me an alternative flight home, re-booked at NO EXTRA COST!! I am super impressed and grateful, and this is one of the reasons why I ALWAYS try to book Singapore Airlines before any other airlines! Service and comfort on board the flights (MEL - SIN, SIN - CPH and AMS - SIN, SIN - MEL) were great with extra attention being paid to my pre-schooler with plenty of chats and making sure he was entertained. The child meals are also great, and I find it fantastic that they are served first, about 20-30 min before the normal meal service, giving a parent the chance to help feed the kid first and be able to eat my own meal while warm :-)","positive"
"1518","Singapore airlines luxury! This was an upgrade we considered for a long flight from Amsterdam to Brisbane for some time before committing, and I am pleased to say this was a great choice, it was the most enjoyable long haul flight either of us had ever experienced. The seating is one plus one, no pesky middles with elbow wars... all very comfortable, and quite easy to sleep (if you feel the need). The entertainment system allows time to drift away, and without doubt this is helped along significantly by the noise cancelling headphones supplied. The A350 is a little louder than an A380 - not too bad though, and the majority of the flight I had headphones glued to my scone. Definitely did not feel any noise issues, with or without the headset. In flight food was very good without quite being up to the Emirates gold standard. Our final leg of the trip involved a switch to the front seats in this premium block, while still very comfortable, the screens are a little more distant, so what you gain in legroom you lose in entertainment standard, this worked in well anyway as I needed some beauty sleep, I am after all only here as eye candy. On the whole, an excellent trip, and well worth the upgrade.","positive"

The treatment my mother and I have received at the Auckland airport from Linda Gu and Laura Yip was beyond disappointing. We have everything in order for my mother to travel to Malaysia vis transit in Singapore today at 1.15am. They made us wait at the counter standing for 2 hours while they went back and forth wondering if my mother held a valid visa. I have advised them I have confirmation from immigration prior to the booking of the flight to ensure everything will be done smoothly. They we unsure and kept snapping pictures of my mothers visa and sending it via WhatsApp to God knows whom to enquire if it's acceptable- is that standard process? Snapping pictures of personal identification /passport and forwarding then on an unsecured platform?. They made us wait until the last 10 minutes and denied her boarding getting an executive decision from the manager NOT Malaysian immigration, who I have just gotten off the phone with and they have confirmed that the visa IS valid and she IS entitled entry into Malaysia. I am unable get in touch with anyone from your contact center to have this matter looked into as they have wrongfully denied my mother boarding. This has given us so much stress and anxiety and this is so appalling for what is touted to be a world class airline! If they had told me upfront that they will not be boarding her as they are unsure and given us some notice we could have gotten immigration on the phone and done something. Instead they waited untill the last moment and just walked away. This is beyond belief","negative"

"486","Excited about going on an A380-800 but the plane was already delayed. I was excited about going on an A380-800 for the first time as Id never flown in one before, however that was tainted by already receiving an email at 6am that morning to say that they had rebooked our onward connection from Singapore Changai to Brisbane international into a 12 hour layover as the flight out of JFK NY left 3hrs late and we wouldn't be able to connect to our original flight. We checked in ok and got a 15 euro meal voucher each to spend at the airport for food due to the delay. The plane came in to Frankfurt on the new scheduled time and was turned around quickly by the ground crew and we were soon boarding for our flight to Singapore. We had booked seats as I wanted to be able to see the engines and the seat was excellent for this. We booked seats 43A&B which were forward economy seats so we were the last group to board. The seat was a standard economy seat with the only issue being a small metal box cutting into the footwell for seat 43A. Not much but just enough to be a pain. I really enjoyed take off and landing with the view of the engines. The service again from the Air Singapore crew was excellent. Very attentive and professional. The inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is excellent and has something for everyone. It was a 12hr flight which is long when flying in economy. The A380-800 was very clean inside. One thing I did note on the bottom level window seat was the bulkhead is about 9 inches away from the seat so it makes resting the pillow against the window impossible to sleep on. When on the A350's, the gap is better for this. Still, an excellent flight and great service from the Singapore team. Although we had a delay, they had rebooked everything and informed us every step of the way and helped everyone make connections when the plane landed in Singapore. Still not a fan of 12 hour layovers though, but they did their best for us. Will definitely fly these guys again.","positive"

"11145","Sydney to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. My first experience on Singapore Airlines A380. The cabin crew were very attentive, friendly, but could smile more. They addressed me by my name and dealt with a few difficult passengers professionally. IFE has an excellent selection. The seats are comfortable (I o had the whole row of 4 to myself!) with handy power sockets on every seat. Food was amazing and beef rendang cooked to perfection . The Singapore Sling is a must try.","positive"
"10728","Singapore to Frankfurt. I was a frequent flyer with Singapore Airlines. I was redeeming my miles and booked my ticket through SIA directly. I received E-Ticket confirmation. But, when I reached airport with my family, they told me my child ticket (3 month) had not been issued. They didn't knew why. They ask me to pay a full price one way ticket at $800, instead of the $102 it was supposed to cost. I sent a letter after the trip and ask explanation and reimbursement. They replied after 1.5 month. They said they made a mistake with the code share partner and apologised, but they didn't reimburse the difference between what I was suppose to pay and what I paid without having any choice at the airport. In short they made a mistake but don't take responsibility. I have stopped using this airline. In addition we were not even together on the first row with bassinet despite there were available seats.","negative"
"9583","Reliable airlines with excellent service I am delighted to use SQ, schedule is on time, and in flight meal is good. I used to think that sq fare would be expensive. But, thanks to travel fair, travel with SQ became affordable, must have a good plan in advance.","positive"
"844","Worth the additional cost for the extra leg room First trip to India - check-in was slow due to the need to check e-visa and vaccinatation documents but was otherwise smooth and fairly rapid. The boarding process could have been improved (no fault of the airline) as no queues were organised. Considering that this flight was over 4 hours, I had chosen to pay a small additional fee that gave me a window seat which no seat in front of me. Being free to stretch my legs as much as I wished as well as being able to simply walk off to visit the washroom outweighed the slighly annoying requirment to have my inflight entertainment system stowed during take-off and landing (as compared to other passengers with seat-back systems). I was glad to see flat trays (rather than heat-retentive boxes, or were the latter only for short flights) were used for meals. The 'chicken and rice' option (actually a sort of briyani) was rather tasty although a little more meat would have been ideal. The crew also did well keeping everyone hydrated, as well as the toilets clean, throughout the flight. And a shout-out to Flight Steward Brandon Sim (I believe that was his name) with whom I had a friendly general exchange with about planes and flying.","positive"
"3854","Rude ground handling, especially for my kids. This was the most traumatizing experiences with an airline for my family, especially for my two kids. On that day, it was our last day in Netherland after I finished my study there and we will leave for good. I already counted my luggages (many luggages) both checked in and cabin. All based on our past experiences with different major airlines i.e. Etihad, KLM, Emirates, Garuda, ANA Air, Qatar Airline, etc. That we will be okay. So, at the airport as per our calculation all the checked baggages went it without problem. The rest is the cabin baggage, which were 1 cabin suitcase and 1 handcarry for each person (with additional kids backpack, for each of my kid). So, all went well until we were at the boarding gate. The ground officer there (male officer) said rudely that: ""what are you thinking? Bringing that many luggages to the cabin?"" And then he try weighing all my luggages based on his ""instinct"" and said that we overweight 30 kilos and must pay 856 Euro. I start panicked, my wife crying, my kids crying. So I choose to throw away all those luggages ans board the plane. But then, after almost entering the plane, they came chased us and yelled I cannot throw my luggages like that. So how I am supposed to do?!?!?! Then, I choose to pay. I had 400 euro in my saving and the rest by cash, so it should be enough. But then, they said they cannot accept debit and/or cash, only credit card! At that time my credit card was not enough to cover that amount. So ultimately, we were kicked out and all of our checked baggages were dropped off. Our flight then re-scheduled to the next day (thanks to the nice lady). So, we sorted everything and throw away many important goods, memento from our life in Netherlands, etc. We wnet again to check in and met again with the male ground handling officer. All the baggages checked in and now they wanted to see our cabin carry on, we were treated like a criminal, my kids were scared to death. After long check, the male officer was pointing at my kids backpack, said that those too already too much for a cabin carry on, I mean...its just a 5 and 8 years kids backpack for god sakes! And, so I told the kids that we must throw their backpacks away. So we did that. Then we went through the boarding process all over again. We were separated from the rest of customer by the same male officer, again, like we were a criminal. He test each of our cabin baggage again with his instinct, after long tiring process, we can board the plain. Interesting fact was, when we transit in Changi, we saw several person that brought three items to the plane, cabin suitcase, backpack and carry on bag (one of them I manage to took the picture). So where is the absolute strictness of 1 person 1 cabin baggage gone? Is it only applied to specific country, or what? So, I just told my children that I will get them a new bag, better than the bags they forced to threw away and also promised them that we will not fly with Singapore airlines again, ever.","negative"
"2693","Unrivaled excellence Exceptional service on board, dedicated caring personnel, professional and always smiling, keeping the cabin clean and tidy all the time on this 12 hour flight, maintaining the toilets spotless. The seats are great, flat bed of course, lot of spaces 1/2/1 seating configuration, corridor access for all, excellent privacy, just one problem with the remote control on the side is very sensitive and can be easily triggered inadvertently. The Airbus A380 makes the flying experience exceptional, smooth, silent flight. The food is within industry standards, nothing special, boarding quick, flight on time. An excellent airline because of its committed people and its great seats.","positive"
"634","What has happened to Singapore Airlines My daughters flew Singapore Airlines from Sydney to LHR and return, arriving home today after a month in the UK. Over the last decade we have regularly flown with Singapore Airlines (SA) and have found them to be really good. Well, it seems things have really changed and not for the better. SA are now running Airbus 350s on the SQ241 route which have very reduced leg room in economy ( 18""). They do not provide a dinner meal on the SA 305 route from LHR to Singapore or the connecting flight to Sydney SA 241. Refreshments and snacks very available on the SQ 305 leg and the service was good. The SA 241 leg was unsatisfactory with poor meals very limited service in economy, no water and soiled toilets from early in the flight. They felt it was more like a budget flight..ie..Scoot with a SA logo. Seems you either pay for PE or BC or your really are in cattle class with Singapore..so very disappointing that SA has followed QANTAS down the cheap and nasty route! Unfortunately, given past good experiences wit SA my Wife and I have booked with SA to go to Europe next year! Will have to review that decision!","negative"
"3541","Extremely disappointed I was told by many people how reliable and fabulous this airline was, so I booked my flights through them. I travelled from Melbourne to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne aboard Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed on my journey home as, despite travelling with my partner, they decided to separate us. Not just a row or two but, 10 rows and a wall separated us. When we mentioned it to the crew in India, the male staff member basically told us it was too bad and we would have to arrange something ourselves once we arrived in Singapore (the 2nd leg of our flight home). Upon arrival in Singapore we were shocked and horrified to find that we would have to speak with the passenger ourselves to sort something out. The airline made an error and we have to sort it out!!! Long story short, we managed to sort it with the fellow traveller but it should never have been left to us to sort. Staff are friendly, food is reasonable and seats are uncomfortable for long haul flights. I would fly Singapore Airlines again but, only if they could ensure me from the get go that when two people are booked together, that they are actually seated together.","neutral"

"2937","Mr Very disappointed with our overnight flight from Singapore and would be hard pressed to go with them again. After take off the staff came with a tray of water, juice and white wine. I asked for something else but never received it. The staff then all disappeared until breakfast was served about 6 hours later. Supper would have been nice. This must be the he easiest roster in Singapore Airline.","negative"
"4956","FLY DURING THE DAY Just wish they could give you a little more leg room. It's just so cramped in Economy. On the way to Japan we had a nigh time flight it was almost imposable to sleep as it's just too uncomfortable. On the way home we had a day time flight I feel this is better as you can read watch movies or play games the time seems to go more quickly.","positive"
"6759","As economy travel goes, pretty good For a three-hour regional flight, I doubt if we could have done better. The leg-room wasn't great, but the food was edible and the wine drinkable. We left on schedule and the timing was good, getting us to Singapore late afternoon. My only complaint would be that we didn't get the seats we had booked online. For our return leg, checking in online a good 36 hours before departure, all aisle seats were already booked. Still, I'd choose SQ over Cathay every time!","positive"

"1332","Generally good but beware of a potentially unplesant issue Singapore Airlines is deservedly a 5-star airline for many reasons. It's hard to stay ahead when it's a benchmark for other airlines, but one area it has featured heavily is a renewal of its inflight cabin experience. We flew this return following a family holiday, and I was quite excited to experience the new slim line seats on the airline's newest Airbus A380. First, the good stuff. Fantastic inflight entertainment, decent-to-good meals (even for economy) so that going hungry is almost unknown, clean suroundings, and service from the flight crew was all we've come to expect - friendly, guest-oriented and helpful albeit a little robotic at times. The rather unexpected issue was actually the new economy seats. In their upright position, we found them fine with adequate room (if there is such a thing these days). However, the seats reclined in a such a way that when the fellow passeger in front does so to the maximum, the inflight screen came very close to one's face. This automatically limits the personal space it a little tricky to get out of one's seat. And what's worse, my fellow passenger below didnt take kindly to me reclining my seat and shoved back with enough force that it forced my seat back to its near-original upright position (I didn't even realise this was possible until this flight). Obviously, this made for some tension between us. While I can certainly understand how he felt (after several months of cooling off), I have to say that this would qualify as my most disappointing flight so far on this legacy airline.","neutral"
"2756","compact design with good legroom, friendly crew BUT you may not get your PRE-PAID selected seat Seating was comfortable for me who is of medium height and built. Food was quite reasonable, with continuous wine supply albeit of single selection red or white. As for paying extra to select our seats, we did not end up getting what we chose and there was no refund. Airline still reserve their right to move you around for their own convenience. And there was no recourse!","positive"
"5421","Airline is good, food was very much average The airline, amenities and staff are all great. However the food is beyond average. Literally a chicken or fish option and everything offered was not appealing at all. Honestly throw me a sandwich any day instead.

"5053","Wonderful Equipment and Great Service The A350-900 is a great plane. Enjoyed the comfortable seats and spaciousness even for economy.

"6684","Great service, unusually decent food Excellent onboard service; and the food served in economy - for which I had low expectations based on other airlines - was unusually tasty. Granted, Darwin is not a busy airport, but the ground staff were extremely helpful and efficient.","positive"
"2136","Not worth paying the extra for Premium Economy Crew were absolutely wonderful both flights I have to point out but premium economy is just not worth the additional expense. The food served on both flights was really poor quality. The seats had slightly more room but really very little difference in overall comfort to an economy seat. No boarding priority- only benefit was early check in which was helpful so I could explore Changi airport without lugging my suitcase. To be perfectly honest I wouldn’t choose to fly Singapore Airlines again after this trip.","neutral"
"11372","Simply perfect! Zurich to Singapore and back from Denpasar to Zurich via Singapore with my family. I bought the tickets online through their web site taking advantage of a special offer they extremely cheap. Upon reservation I was immediately allowed to choose the seats and special meals (I am vegetarian). Every flight was perfectly on time or landed early. Seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment excellent. My special meal arrived at the same time of other meals warm and very good other meals were also good. Large variety of drinks and good wine. Several times during the flight they offered water juices and snacks. I was travelling with a 4yr old child who was continuously spoiled by the cabin crew with gifts and additional food. We asked for sandwiches and snacks several times and they offered them immediately. Getting in the aircraft on the way back I remarked that the seat belt on my seat was broken. Ground staff arrived immediately they dismantled the seat and changed the belt. The whole operation did not take more than 5 minutes! A special word to the cabin crew it was not my first flight with Singapore Airlines and I am always astonished by how lovely caring and professional they are! They are always smiling never get nervous or stressed and are extremely efficient they never forget something you ask them!","positive"

"7177","Worst Experience Ever, Unlike The Usual Experience This is the worst experience that I have had with Singapore Airlines or any other Airlines. I have been part of the Travel Trade for over 25 years and have always vouched for Singapore Airlines. I never expected such carelessness & casual attitude from Singapore Airlines. My bad experience started with the Singapore Airlines office in Ahmedabad. They personally know me as well as our company for over a decade now. We have been giving them business for almost 2 decades. Since, I was traveling myself, I requested for certain good seats, if possible. However sometimes the Airlines sell these seats (emergency row seats with more legroom) and hence I had only requested them to keep a small message in their airline system to allocate these seats to me if they are not taken till last minute. They promised the same but never did anything. In fact they blocked 2 seats for me & my wife on two separate rows !!! I had selected special meals when I booked the tickets, almost a month in advance. It is also printed in my tickets - AVML meals. However when we boarded the aircraft they had no instructions about our meals ??? We are strict vegetarians and hence we said that we will not eat in this case. Later a junior air hostess came to us and told us that they have some different kind of vegetarian meals for us. She told me that some other guests refused to eat their meals and hence she was obliging us !!! I do not understand if the staff is trained to present the matter in better way ? We felt like beggars who were given food because someone else decided ""not to eat"". This could have been simply presented in a better manner I also don't know if the staff is trained to identify between veg. and non veg. food ??? They gave us lamb meat and presenting the same as vegetarian food. When I opened the food box, i realized that it was not vegetarian food and hence I asked the air hostess again to re-confirm. She showed the label on the box, which she claimed to mention that it was vegetarian food. However she was not ready to see the actual food.....only looking at the label and insisting that this was vegetarian food. I was still skeptical and hence I requested to call her supervisor. It took quite some time and in the meantime, my wife already started eating the food, trusting her word. The supervisor came and immediately understood the matter. He took both the food packets and confirmed after some time that it was lamb meat. My wife being highly religious and strictly vegetarian felt sick and was deeply hurt emotionally. She could not forgive herself for trusting the airline staff...........they later apologized several times but the damage was already done beyond their imagination. We later tried to sleep to forget the entire episode. However it seems that blankets given by the airline staff were not properly washed or had some kind of bugs. Both of us 8-10 dark red rashes on our legs. Something bit us or there was something in the blanket which was allergic and we started to itch like crazy in both the legs. My wife was also bleeding in couple of places when we landed at Singapore airport. These 3 incidents made it the worst experience of our life time. This review is based on my last experience and hence cannot to generalized for all other trips.","negative"
"8576","Can't fault the Singapore Airlines Service Of course you expect a better service in Business Class, and Singapore Airlines deliver. Very attentive staff who greet you by name, great food and drink options, and nothing is too much trouble. My wife's seat table developed a fault (after the meal service) and could not be stowed. Four staff were involved in getting it fixed over a period of maybe 10 or 15 minutes. Later in flight there was an invitation to spend some money from the in-flight shopping, to make up for the inconvenience. This was above and beyond, and was not asked for or expected. Thank you Singapore Airlines for a great trip.","positive"
