2017-01-06,7,7,"""provided quick lunch service ""","✅ Verified Review | Jakarta to Singapore on the A350-900 (9V-SMD). Check-in was quick since we checked in online and arrived early. Flight left Jakarta slightly behind schedule but arrived on time in Singapore. Flight attendants provided quick lunch service and two drink runs in a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). Even though they were still very polite and courteous, the FA on this particular flight were not as energized or cheerful as other flights we were in. Entertainment system uses touchscreen system that is very easy to use with lots of choices. Restrooms were clean. Minimum communications from flight deck; we didn't get announcement on which terminal in Singapore we will arrive in and local weather conditions like they usually broadcast before arrival. We have a connecting flight in Singapore from Terminal 3, so I asked several FA for arrival information and they didn't know either. I finally got the informations I needed on arrival terminal (Terminal 2) after looking at the system generated flight informations in the entertainment system; and even informing the FA on this."
2017-01-06,8,8,"""A350 cabin bright and airy""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Jakarta on an A350-900 (9V-SMD). Flight left behind schedule. We waited for like 30+ minutes after scheduled departure time on ground in Singapore before push back to avoid getting trapped in air traffic congestion in Jakarta. Excellent communication from Flight Deck. Flight Attendants on this flight worked hard, providing lunch service with two drink runs on a full flight for such a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). FAs were very cheerful and polite. I pre-ordered in-flight merchandise (aircraft models) and they brought it to me before the flight lands. Aircraft was a new A350, the cabin was bright and airy. and large windows adding to a sense of space. Entertainment using the latest touchscreen which is very easy and fun to use. Only gripe I had was one piece of our luggage was stranded in Singapore and didn't make it on our flight, but after checking with SQ baggage service person in Jakarta we were told that it will arrive on the next flight from Singapore 2.5 hours later. The issue with the delayed/misplaced bag happened most likely because we were connecting in Singapore an hour before this flight from our previous flight from Houston."
2017-01-05,10,10,"""overall an excellent flight""","✅ Verified Review | Houston to Singapore via Manchester on Boeing 77-300ER (9V-SWH). Check-in process at Houston Bush was just OK; they were not as fast or efficient as Qatar check-in next door. Houston to Manchester flight left relatively on time. Cabin Service was great, the FAs did quick hot towel, drinks and dinner service right after take off, and they also provided a birthday cake for my son as was requested. Good communication from the flight deck when there was turbulence coming up so everybody's prepared. Afterwards they dimmed the cabin lights so passengers can rest. FAs worked hard; they kept patrolling the cabin with water and juice runs every 15-30 minutes or so throughout the night, and occasional snack runs too (sandwiches, chocolate, fruits). Had breakfast before we landed, and arrived at Manchester ahead of schedule. Manchester to Singapore flight left behind schedule but they catch up and arrived on time in Singapore. Fresh set of crew from Manchester provided excellent service; the FA offered three meal services throughout the 13 hours flight (Breakfast, Lunch and light Supper) plus snack and drinks in between. We're kept full at all times with good food choices. Leading FA engaged me to ensure that my son had had his birthday cake as requested, even offering another one for this leg, which we politely refused (his birthday was already over!). Good communication from flight deck regarding arriving terminal and local weather. Cabin crew on both legs ensure that the restrooms were always cleaned and in pristine condition. Entertainment system was easy to use, a slightly older version without touch screen, and even though it may not have an obscenely extensive entertainment choice like Emirates, they have a large collection of movies and TV series including new releases that is more than enough to keep you entertained throughout both legs. Overall an excellent flight. **DOING"
2017-01-05,3,3,"""SQ have really dropped the ball""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor - Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit. The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy."
2017-01-04,8,8,"""A350 makes flights easy""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Singapore. A good experience on Singapore Airlines with a few hiccups. We got the middle seat to ourselves in economy which made the 16.5 hour journey quite pleasant. The nicest part of this flight is the actual aircraft. The A350 makes such non stop flights easy on the body. A plus for Singapore Airlines for including this in their fleet. Service standards are good, but quite often I feel that SQ have a pretty rushed and least patient service on the San Francisco route. The cabin was overall clean but there was some muck above my window which I had to clean. Biggest disappointment was when I asked for the Singapore immigration card and the crew member told me they hadn't brought any on the flight. 2 hours later another crew member started offering them. An apology for the error was not forthcoming which was the actual annoyance."
2017-01-04,8,8,"""flight attendants were exceptionally friendly""","✅ Verified Review | An excellent flight with Singapore Airlines from Wellington to Canberra. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly, professional and attentive. The food was also very good. The seat was perfectly adequate for the three hour flight and looked ok for an overnight service. If I did have one complaint, it would be that the cabin was uncomfortably warm. The flight left on time, arrived early and I was out the front door of Canberra airport ten minutes after touch down, a great new option between the capital cities that I look forward to using on a regular basis."
2017-01-03,10,10,"""the services were fantastic""","✅ Verified Review | We flew Singapore Airlines from Surabaya to Singapore for Christmas and New Year holidays. Our flight was delayed by approximately 15 minutes due to traffic congestion at Juanda International Airport. Despite the delay, we landed on time at Changi International Airport. The services on the ground and in the air were fantastic and the meals were quite tasty. We were very happy to fly with Singapore Airlines and will continue to use it."
2017-01-02,4,4,"""not fly again long haul""","✅ Verified Review | London to Singapore return, and the Premium Economy experience was very poor. Despite booking some months in advance, they neglected to allocate us any seats together and our party of 4 was distributed throughout the cabin. The seat configuration is 2-4-2 and there are no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. Rather than a separate cabin curtained off, Premium Economy is just the front section of the economy section. The seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than Air NZ. The food was terrible. We used the ""book the cook"" option on the return flight and this was no better, though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group. The staff were unfriendly and snacks on the 14 hour flight (2 meals were offered, the second 6 hours before arrival) had to be requested via the call button. The flight arrived early and the plane was quite new but would not fly Singapore Airlines again long haul."
2017-01-02,1,1,"""make sure to read all 20 pages of T&Cs""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to London via Singapore. If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long. And if you want your money back then there is a $200 cancellation fee. I have cut up my Elite Gold card and will never fly with Singapore Airlines again."
2016-12-31,1,1,"""magnitude of change inexcusable""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Chiang Mai return via Singapore booked for March 2017. Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit. But if you say okay to these choices ""you could end up with any one of them"", and all are inferior to the original reservation. I cancelled, and will not be booking this airline again. This magnitude of change is inexcusable and the subsequent policy absurd."
2016-12-30,1,1,"""staff were unfriendly""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Auckland with Singapore Airlines. This was one of the worst flights I have ever flown. The Premium Economy area was terrible. Firstly, no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. We had to use Economy Class. The seats were ok but, when the person in front reclined their seats, we could not move. My husband's seat in fact was broken. The service was terrible - the worst I have experienced in 45 years of travelling. The food was awful and service was too rushed. The staff were unfriendly. We will not be flying Singapore Airlines again."
2016-12-30,6,6,"""cost cutting in economy class meals""","✅ Verified Review | Tokyo to Jakarta via Singapore. Exceptional, but not in a good way. Missed connecting flight to Jakarta due to afternoon typhoon in Singapore. Plane from Tokyo landed in Batam, Indonesia instead, flew back to Singapore in three hours. Same issue happened once due to technical problem, but apparently SIA always tries their best not to compensate me with business class seats, even though I missed my flight because of their problems and I have been their gold member for 4 years now. I was compensated only with another economy class seat and SGD 15 meal voucher that I can only redeem at limited number of food outlets at Changi airport, and most of them are too random (food not looking good at all). They have been also been doing this cost cutting in the economy class meals by not giving appetizers anymore. FAs never happy when I order some special drinks even though they are on the menu. If SIA wants to do some cost cutting or what not, they should have made it less obvious, especially to loyal customers, otherwise loyal customers will look for other cost-effective Star Alliance carriers. Their ticket price for the same route is a lot more expensive compared to some other Star Alliance such as ANA and Asiana Airlines."
2016-12-28,8,8,"""cabin crew were friendly""","Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew were friendly, food was good, but some things could improve. The earphones sounded and looked really cheap. The IFE screen was quite dark even at max brightness. If you are sitting at a window seat with your window slightly open and its bright outside, you will understand what I mean. Although the plane seemed old, it was quite clean."
2016-12-27,10,10,"""very impressive performance""","✅ Verified Review | First time I've flown with Singapore Airlines and they didn't let us down. Flew from Sydney to Colombo via Singapore. Although we were in economy the aircraft was clean, ground crew and cabin crew were friendly and attentive throughout and food and entertainment were fine. The seat on the return leg on the upper deck of the A380 was so comfortable I had to be woken for breakfast. It was on the return leg that this airline really impressed me. At Singapore there was a technical problem with the A380 slotted to fly us back to Sydney. We were advised immediately and reallocated to another gate where within an hour, the entire passenger list was boarded onto another A380 and we departed 1 hour late. Who has a 'spare' A380 with flight crew ready to go with passengers boarded in 60 minutes? They also made up the time and landed us in Sydney ahead of schedule by about 5 minutes. This is a very impressive performance and one that some other airlines might seek to emulate. We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip. No-one should be blamed for technical problems but the rude and unprofessional manner in which ground staff at Sydney airport managed passenger enquiries was unparalleled in my 44 years of flying. We will never fly with Air New Zealand again. We will fly with Singapore Air."
2016-12-20,10,10,"""a great way to fly""","✅ Verified Review | Auckland to Singapore. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best you can fly. The food selection is extensive and delicious. There are many beverages to choose from, good selection of wine. The cabin crew are attentive, and they feed you well. The seat can be transformed into a bed that is comfortable to sleep during the long flight. There is a wide selection of movies that I had to make the tough choice of sleeping 40,000 feet in the air or watching the very nice movies with noise-cancelling headphones. I enjoyed my flight thoroughly and would love to fly with Singapore Airlines again. Certainly a great way to fly."
2016-12-19,1,1,"""worst ever experience flying""","✅ Verified Review | I flew from Heathrow to Singapore then Denpasar to Singapore to Heathrow. My outward flight was appalling. I am a deafblind traveller, the airline was advised of my condition and requirements by both my travel agent and my mother. On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasn't told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. I was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. This is totally unacceptable. Singapore Airlines have acknowledged their errors but not offered appropriate compensation - an absolute disgrace. My worst ever experience flying."
2016-12-13,6,6,"""attendants stayed in the galley ""","✅ Verified Review | Trip not up to Singapore Airlines standards, behind me and my wife there was a couple with a child sitting the seats with them. Three people in two seats! The child was very noisy the whole 15 hour flight. We told the flight attendant several times that they had to do something. Nothing was ever done. The flight attendants just stayed back in the galley and had a five hour rest in the middle of the flight. Not much attention paid to anyone."
2016-12-13,5,5,"""too plastic and fake smiles""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Hong Kong. Outbound leg on Singapore Airlines A380, stuck in the dreaded middle seat which was awful. Attendants were unfriendly and telling me to check in 10 minutes earlier online to get an exit row seat despite me having said I was on the website and it didn't allow me 48 hours beforehand. Only 1 friendly member of staff during the trip. Fish pasta for special meal was a let down - overcooked and too many bones. Inbound, service was a little better. Standard and expected for the price of ticket I paid but a little too plastic and fake smiles."
2016-12-05,7,7,"""experiences were average""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Bangkok via Tokyo / Singapore. This is my first time for Singapore Airline, on 3 Legs the experiences were average. Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita the cabin was great, IFE was ok, crew was not so nice. Narita to Singapore the cabin was clean, seat was comfortable, IFE was nice. Only thing that made me surprise was cabin crew because that were not nice, no smile. Singapore to Bangkok the cabin was good , Seat was comfort but look little bit old, crew was average no smile at all."
2016-12-04,9,9,"""friendly, attentive and active""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Amsterdam via Singapore. Legroom is comparable with other good economy class airlines, but they are wider which makes a difference. They are comfortable, everything works - meals, drink service, food service, punctuality. Singapore Airlines can make a reasonably good economy experience by being friendly, attentive and active when serving customers. Even the food was good for economy, while maintaining simplicity. It was 24 hours from Melbourne to Amsterdam and I don't feel tired or washed out on arrival - had a good sleep on both legs. It's worth that little extra expense and Singapore Airport is the best to kill time in. The business class looked fabulous, but their premium economy didn't seem that impressive as I walked past it."
2016-11-29,10,10,"""5 stars from us""",✅ Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore in First class. One of the best flights we ever took with total attention to detail. Singapore Airlines suite arrangement is amazing with a full bed being assembled when it was time to rest. The entire flight was silky smooth and departed on time as well as arrived on time. The crew was just the best with the female Chief Steward running a great team. Krug champagne was a nice touch along with very useful inflight cosmetic bags. The Entertainment monitor is huge. 5 stars from us for this flight.
2016-11-28,10,10,"""seat was very comfortable""","✅ Verified Review | I flew Milan to Singapore return in business class. Seat was very comfortable, on return flight I think I slept almost 10 hours after having dinner at the Singapore lounge. Service very good. When arrived in Singapore I found my luggage broken. They collected it from my hotel the morning after, and in 24 hours the luggage was repaired and back to my room."
2016-11-18,7,7,"""cabin crew not that nice""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Singapore. My first time flying with Singapore Airlines - check in on-time and no queue at all. The ground service I was satisfied with. The aircraft was nice and the seat very comfortable. The inflight entertaiment was not that good and the earphones were also poor. The food is standard, but compared to Garuda or Emirates it is not as good. The cabin crew not that nice - no smile, just a straight face."
2016-11-18,8,8,"""IFE screen is really bad""","✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Singapore. Excellent inflight service. Food is good. Beverage selection is good and I love their cocktail, especially the Bailey White Russian. The aircraft seem a bit old and the IFE screen is really bad, really dark and difficult to watch to movie, earphone provided is also uncomfortable and sound quality is really bad."
2016-11-17,9,9,"""service is also really good""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Jakarta. The aircraft was new, the food is excellent. Cabin staff service is also really good, even though one of the stewardess seem a bit grumpy (maybe due to the hectic of serving meal in such a short flight). The inflight entertainment is really excellent. High quality screen, latest tech. I wish I had this in my previous longer flight to/from Singapore / Tokyo."
2016-11-17,9,9,"""excellent cabin crew""",✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Singapore. The flight was quite full but this didn't stop excellent cabin crew from providing a top notch service. The cabin was clean and fresh. There were two meal options offered and food was good. The food for the flight from Bangkok leg seems better than the food out of Singapore. Very good selection of entertainment on Krisworld.
2016-11-15,8,8,"""high standard of service""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore. Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment. The flight attendants patrolled the cabin two to three times between meals with professional manner and meticulous grooming. All in all, this flight demonstrated Singapore Airlines high standard of service."
2016-11-15,4,4,"""use such old dated cabin""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Brisbane. I am a star alliance gold member for the last 4 years and regular traveler on this sector. Recently Singapore Airlines has decided to replace the regular A330 service with an older much worse Boeing 777-200ER service. I am surprised they would use such old dated cabin in this aircraft, my main concern is the poor qaulity entertainment screen, also the poor meal service now converted to a brunch and every poor standard, better meal served on budget airlines. There was no drinks service before the meals. I hope they review this and revert back to regular A330 service."
2016-11-14,9,9,"""A350 is an excellent plane""","Amsterdam to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I had a wonderful flight on SQ323 to Singapore. The new A350-900 is an excellent plane. I had seat 52C, the leg room was more than sufficient. The cabin crew very good, looking after our wellbeing throughout the whole flight, even on a long 12-hour flight as this one. The food was delicious, I had diet-meals on all flights and they took great care of me. One minor thing: the toilets on the A350 look very small. From Singapore to Melbourne I sat at 37G. This was an older version of the B777-300ER, with an older inflight entertainment system and more important not enough legroom. My knees were stuck against the seat in front of me. Cabin crew good, food was excellent and the 6 hour flight was over in a blink. On the return flight in from Melbourne to Singapore I changed seats the day before and sat at a window seat. This B777-300ER looked more modern and the legspace was much more than on the way into Melbourne. Again a very pleasant flight with a pleasant cabin crew. Only the last hour we had a bumpy flight with thunderstorms above Indonesia and Singapore, but the crew and pilots did a good job. The flight to Amsterdam left much later because of bad weather at Singapore, for almost half the flight we had a very bumpy and tiring flight but staff stayed polite and kept their friendly faces. My overall experience with SIA was very good. Next time this company will take me to Australia again."
2016-11-10,6,6,"""the PTV really let me down""","✅ Verified Review | Istanbul to Sydney via Singapore. First time I had flown Singapore Airlines in over 25 years and I had very high expectations. First impression was that the interior looked clean but slightly dated. The seats were comfortable but the armrests didn't come all the way up - which was annoying. Had 3 seats to myself on one flight but couldn't stretch/sleep due to the arms rests. Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food / drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals. Steel cutlery was appreciated. Hot towel service is excellent. Toilets were always kept clean with nice amenities. They were also larger than on other airlines. All in all, I was really looking forward to a 5 Star experience but the PTV really let me down. Ruined the flight given I had over 38 hours flying time on this trip and had been really looking forward to seeing some movies / tv etc. With the new economy seats, Singapore Airlines will be a 5 star product but without them they are barely 3.5."
2016-11-10,9,9,"""flying economy is a delight""","✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Singapore on the day flight with the A330 and return on the A380. With two rounds of drink service and a meal service, cabin attendants were very attentive and thoughtful. The seat on the A380 upper deck is much better than the seat on the A330. Flying economy with them is a delight. Cabin presence is great. IFE in want of more movies. WiFI was available on the A380. Extremely clean cabin and highly recommended. Singapore Airlines is my favourite airline."
2016-11-06,10,10,"""staff efficient and effective""","✅ Verified Review | My friends and I flew Singapore Airlines from Manila to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore last week for a holiday. From updating a companion's passport details through their reservations line in Manila to the orderly boarding procedure, one gets a sense of the quality. The meals, particularly the pork pasta dish served on the Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore sector, were divine. The frequent drinks run was very highly appreciated. The cabin staff were efficient and effective, particularly with regard to safety, with polite but firm requests to stow bags and trays when necessary. The Boeing 777-200 is on the senior side with a minute screen but the A330-300 on the SIN-SGN vv. route is another story."
2016-11-03,10,10,"""on time and crews very good""","✅ Verified Review | My wife and I flew London to Auckland via Singapore with Singapore Airlines, both legs on an Airbus A380. The airline has 3 configurations on these aircraft, we booked on the flights with some economy seats on the upper deck, we had row exit row side seats which gave a vast amount of leg room. Both flights on time and crews very good."
2016-11-01,10,10,"""it's got to be SIA""","Sydney to Kolkata via Singapore. If it's Singapore Airlines then it's perfect. I have travelled on Emirates, Qatar, British Airways, Thai Airways, you name it. Over all these airlines I love Singapore Airlines. I travelled on a Airbus A380 from Sydney to Singapore and trust me they have the best seats and best food around. It was a pretty long flight and I never felt bored, to be honest I wanted to spend a little more time on the A380. Later that day I had a connecting flight to Kolkata. I spent a bit of my time at the lounge which was splendid. I was 10 mins away from missing my flight because I almost forgot what time it was when I was at the lounge. The flight to Kolkata was a red eye and pretty tiring one, but I asked the flight attendant if she could serve me hot chocolate after I wake up. Surprising just after I woke up she came to me and did her duty, and she even asked me if I wanted some food. If you're flying Business or even Economy it's got to be SIA!"
2016-10-24,1,1,"""marginally superior to Economy""","✅ Verified Review | In September / October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service."
2016-10-21,5,5,"""space is paramount for my flying experience""","✅ Verified Review | I recently flew from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore in economy class. This was my first time flying Singapore Airlines, and I had high expectations. I am tall, 6 foot 5 inches, so space is paramount for my flying experience to be comfortable. Sadly SQ lacks this. I had 4 different versions of the B777 on this trip, and I found the newer the aircraft, the less space there was between seats. Food was ok, and service was great. Cabins seemed unclean. If you're travelling in Economy, don't expect a great experience, as it seems SQ only cares for it top dollar paying business class passengers. Will stick to my usual choices of Qantas and Garuda Indonesia in the future."
2016-10-19,7,7,"""disappointed how this was handled""","✅ Verified Review | I had a delayed flight from Tampa (on JetBlue), scheduled initially at 4.30pm but delayed to 5.06pm in taking off at 5.35 pm to JFK with a connection flight to Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines at 8.55pm which I of course, missed by the time I got to the other Terminal and through security. I was stranded at JFK a bit after 9.00pm because at the counter at the gate was no one anymore and the tiny booth is only occupied a few hours at odd hours per day. So I called the 1-800 # on my booking confirmation and was told that they would put me on the very next flight at 8.55am, yes the person said am! But as all offices are closed now I will get a confirmation call once they open the next morning! Learned later that they are in San Francisco, 3 hours behind us. So I went back to the other Terminal to the help desk of JetBlue, which had the delayed plane - after more than an hour with several phone calls I finally got a room in an hotel for the night, I finally made it after midnight into my room. The next morning I rushed to the Airport only to learn that there is no am flight ! The flight is apparently daily at 8.55 pm. I couldn't believe what I was told on the phone. I already spent a short night without my luggage or personal belongings and fresh clothes and now I had to sit another 12 hours around. Once the booth from Singapore Airline was occupied at 2.55 pm I told them about my dilemma and he called his supervisor to find out if I could reschedule my flight back from FRA, Germany to JFK : instead of Oct. 03, 2016 to one or two days later because of my lost 24 hours here at the Airport. Nope, nothing to do, because I already have gotten an hotel room for the night ! Unbelievable, I would have slept in a corner at the Airport they would have rescheduled my flight back home? I didn't even get to choose after this ordeal, really? It's a shame that the company is not more flexible or willing to do more for these kind of situations. I'm very disappointed how this was handled."
2016-10-18,7,7,"""not a great deal of consistency""","✅ Verified Review | Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit. After having such a great experience on the initial trip I felt let down. Still quite good but I felt I could have been with any other airline. I wish there was more consistency. I would still opt for them though at least outbound."
2016-10-17,9,9,"""food and wine all very good""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Singapore. The 2013 version of business class is quite an improvement on the 2006. The seat was as roomy and still the class leader, but now it is more flexible: it has more options for reclined seating without going into the full bed routine. Blankets, pillows, etc, are top quality, though no amenities pack as usual with Singapore Airlines, but there's stuff in the nice bathrooms. New 18"" screen was fantastic, though I find the range of watching and listening on Singapore Airlines somehow terribly middle of the road and safe. Food and wine with lots of choices and all very good, well plated and thought out. The FAs were responsive and worked hard, they saw issues without being told and dealt with them gracefully. But they were chilly and somehow robotic. Engagement was not on the agenda; it rarely is on Singapore Airlines unless you are in First/Suites. On time, spotless, efficient, and careful with premium passengers."
2016-10-16,10,10,"""still treats economy passengers with respect""","✅ Verified Review | Full flight Melbourne to Singapore. Older 777 plane. Chose two seats together, there are not a lot of these, but they were great. You expect very little in economy these days as most airlines have made economy a miserable experience for passengers. Singapore Airlines still treats economy passengers with respect and I was so impressed. We boarded in sections in Melbourne, it was monitored carefully with some held back as they tried to ""skip the queue"" as some always do. Left a little late but not by much. the hot towels before you leave and just before you arrive are a nice touch most airlines have stopped. The seat was wider than most economy. We got a refreshing drink and peanuts shortly after takeoff. Two hours in was a meal. I chose non seafood so my seat was stickered accordingly, I had a fantastic lunch. Quality tender chicken breast in a lovely light soy gravy with perfectly cooked vegetables, hot crispy bread roll, crackers, cheese, water, dessert and real cutlery, Drinks though didn't come out until everyone else got their lunch and I did sit with my tray there till everyone else was done too. No big deal. Entertainment was probably the only thing that they fall down on with not the greatest sound quality. Had a nap after lunch, then a mushroom and chicken pie before landing, All in all the Melb-Singapore flight was pretty well near perfect and we even landed half hour early. Singapore to Hanoi was on an older plane again. Seats had some marks in them, pocket torn and window very scratched. The service was good still, but not quite as good as on the ex Melb flight. The entertainment system again not the greatest but watchable. The food too, another lunch seemed to be lacking both in quality and quantity but was still pretty good. All in all, I thought for economy flights, Singapore provides a better experience than I have had in years."
2016-10-15,9,9,"""found seats very comfortable""",✅ Verified Review | Perth to Singapore. Very pleasant flight and found seats very comfortable. Found the meal tasty and decent portions. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines to offer cognac. Cabin crew were attentive and offered refreshments throughout the flight . Would definitely try to take them again when planning my next trip.
2016-10-14,1,1,"""old planes, uncomfortable seats""","✅ Verified Review | Hong Kong to Singapore. I had high expectations of Singapore Airlines and may be that contributed to feel very dissapointed towards this overrated airline. Majority of people have an pre conception of this airline that is not true. The ground staff in HK is not Singapore Airlines, thereafter when I asked for something as look at my star alliance account they were unable. The plane B777 was old, uncomfortable seats. The food was poor and the IFE limited. Thr flight was late so I had to run from one terminal wing to another to not loose my connecting flight to Delhi. Appalling customer service in India. When searching for flights, Singapore Airlines is ranked as an expensive airline compared to others in the same route. I don't see why, poor service on ground and in the air, old planes, uncomfortable seats and terrible food. Lack of customer service."
2016-10-11,7,7,"""transfer time was just 35 mins""","Hong Kong to London via Singapore. Very helpful and friendly ground staff at HKG. Flight to SIN was delayed by approx 30 mins due to conditions along flight path. Very new and comfortable cabin on B777, with extremely large entertainment screen and glass panel controller. Delicious food as well as generous refills for drinks/alcohol. Scheduled transfer time was 50 minutes, but as plane was delayed, actual transfer time was just 35 mins. But arrival gate and departure gates are right next to each other, plus security checks are performed right at the gate, minimising greatly transfer time and effort. Therefore transfer was extremely smooth with much time to spare. SQ's A380 cabin was worn out, old and narrower seats with slow-reacting entertainment system. One of the only two toilets for economy on the upper deck was not working and closed, which was extremely disappointing as queues for toilet can be as long as 15-20 mins depending on luck. Upon arrival at LHR, disembarking was slow and walk to immigration from gate was extremely long, which was very tiring after a 13 hours flight. Quick immigration and baggage reclaim."
2016-10-10,7,7,"""pleased with service onboard""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Brisbane on Singapore Airlines on a group of around 40. As a leader of the group, I have requested through my travel agent an aisle seat at the back of my group members so that I can facilitate and coordinate my group easier. I checked in at Changi airport Terminal 3 as the first person in my group. When I told her that I had requested an aisle seat of the back of my group, she rejected with an unsmiling face and said there was no choice of seats for group travel. Throughout the whole check-in, she was smile-less. The check-in was unpleasant. My co-leader checked-in in another counter as the last person in my group. The counter staff was a lady who was more willing to help to look for aisle seat for my co-leader. Onboard, the cabin crew was pleasant and diligent in giving out water/juices in between meals. Seat room was sufficient. Lots of movies available for watching. The meals were average. Apart from the disappointing ground service, I am pleased with the service onboard."
2016-10-06,9,9,"""service was great""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Paris and my first long haul trip with Singapore Airlines - it was amazing. I was in awe of the big plane and service was great. Food was ok but other airlines provide more. I was fortunate enough to be seated on the top deck and it was perfect. Comfort kit just contains basic items such as socks and toothbrush / toothpaste with no sleep masks. Would have wanted to have that for this long flight. There were a lot of choices in the movies. The inside of the aircraft looks a little dated from the seats to the toilet. Aside from that, everything else is excellent."
2016-10-05,6,6,"""Service was exceptional""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Jakarta. Check in really smooth, and without any troubles the staff guide us through the boarding gate, seats. Seat with a lack of foot rest, legroom acceptable, able to charge devices. Service was exceptional! Really good service. Entertainment with lots of variety, however my IFE hangs a few times. Meal was horrible. Tasteless and lack of fruits Overall, the meal is something they really need to improve on."
2016-10-05,9,9,"""could not fault this flight""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Moscow DME via Singapore with Singapore Airlines – all on a B777-300ER except the last SIN-SYD which was on the upper deck of the A380. As this was a early bird fare booked last year it was very reasonably priced. Sydney check-in easy and quick. Boarding orderly. SQ222 to SIN departed on time, arrived 1 hour early giving us more time in transit to relax before the next sector to Moscow. SQ222 was a pleasant flight, friendly and attentive cabin crew. The next leg to Moscow, whilst sitting in aircraft waiting to taxi for takeoff, a senior cabin crew member approached us advising that our entertainment systems were not working in our seats and politely invited us to sit a few seats forward in exit row seats. Needless to say, we jumped at the opportunity. Pre-dinner drinks were served quickly as was the tasty supper. Breakfast was also wholesome and filling. Had a most comfortable and pleasant flight and was able to get a valuable 5 hours sleep thanks to the exit seat legroom. Enjoyed chatting with the personable cabin crew in the galley also throughout the flight who were approachable, professional, warm and informative – particularly about Moscow and their experiences. On this sector SIN/DME, the staff were most attentive. Arrived in Moscow refreshed after what was a total of 18 hours flying time. This was one of the best flights I have had for a long time – with all carriers – as I could not fault this flight. Return DME to SIN SQ61 also lucked out with exit row seats after I requested them on board – when I saw they were vacant and this once again help make the overnight flight to SIN very pleasant and quick. Meals from Russia were tasty. Departed on time arrived early. The last sector on the A380 again departed early and arrived early. Another overnight flight with the usual high standard service with a smile, attentive crew throughout, comfortable seats and superior airline food. Toilets were kept clean on all flights. Of note was that Singapore Airlines seems to have mastered the most suitable, comfortable cabin temperature for their red eye flights compared to other airlines where it can be extremely chilly."
2016-09-30,10,10,"""crew were very polite""",✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Hong Kong with Singapore Airlines. The crew were very polite and they smiled every single time I asked for something. The meal was great they had menu for this flight. There were 3 available options for economy class including the vegetarian menu. The inflight entertainment was updated and had many several new movies. This flight was fantastic.
2016-09-30,9,9,"""crew polite, meal was great""",✅ Verified Review | Jakarta to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. This flight was really good. The crew were polite and the meal was great. The crew asked many times whether I needed anything that they could make me more comfortable. The inflight entertainment was a bit old school on this flight but even so they have many updated movies and TV shows which has just launched. Overall I really love flying with Singapore Airlines.
2016-09-29,8,8,"""a comfortable flight""","✅ Verified Review | Bali to Tokyo via Singapore. First leg Bali to Singapore on A330. Ordered special fruit platter meal and tasted delicious. Great choice of in-flight entertainment. Toilet hygiene could have been improved. Second leg Singapore to Tokyo Haneda a comfortable flight on latest Boeing 777-300ER cabin. Both mid-night snack and breakfast were tasty. New, wide 11.1-inch IFE screen offered latest movies, TV programs and nice flight path simulation. Needed to wait for quite a while for baggage but that is airport's fault not SIA's."
2016-09-25,8,8,"""airline is certainly for you""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Hong Kong. Original A380 but was swapped out for a Boeing 777, so a little disappointed. My last experience with them was on a Boeing 747 (wasn't great then), and their service has improved considerably since. Check in was friendly and fuss free, and got along my way really quick. The IFE is rather dated but the selection was rich. Cabin interior was cosy and comfortable despite the age of the aircraft, making itself rather distinguishable from their sister budget air Scoot. The most memorable part was the food, which is a portion rather worthy of premium economy or even business class of other airlines. Return to Singapore an A330 looked newer and IFE was touch-screen. Cabin crew quickly served drinks and snacks after take-off, as there was slight delay on the ground. Separately they served the meal, and again they did not disappoint. Topped it off with a Hagen-Das ice-cream. The price was reasonably good as I booked early. If you are particular about having good food on board, this airline is certainly for you."
2016-09-25,8,8,"""place cushions for back support""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Dubai. On my last flight I sat bulkhead. Today I’m sitting on a regular next gen biz class seat on SQ. I’m tall and with this seat if you’re sitting straight up (or slightly angled) you cannot stretch your legs straight ahead for you hit the seat in front. So to stretch out you have to sit sideways to put your feet in the allocated space. Thus, you also need to place a lot of cushions for back support so that you don’t feel the corner of the seat into which you’re leaning. Once you get into position it’s OK. But initially it feels uncomfortable for you’re sitting sideways. It also feels more extreme/tight compared to the older version of this seat. Given how many great new business class seats there are out there where you stretch out straight ahead, I think Singapore Airlines is soon going to have to change this seat configuration to stay on top. It is fine for medium-haul flights, but I think for the super long-haul flights it would become uncomfortable. A small detail that I love on these newly refurbished planes is the toilet seat handle. Such a simple feature that I’ve seen for years on the B747-800i but not on any other planes. With this small handle it’s so easy to lift the toilet seat up and so much more hygenic than the old way. The simple things!"
2016-09-25,10,10,"""seat has lots more storage space""","✅ Verified Review | Finally I get to fly on the Next Gen business class product from Singapore Airlines from Dubai to Singapore. The interior of the cabin is definitely more stylish with a copper - silver - gray colour palette that exudes elegance. For a change I sat in the bulkhead, which is usually not my preferred seat. But with this new seat, I think that is the best spot for you can stretch your legs straight ahead and not sideways like with the other seats. The seat has lots more storage space which is always welcome, along with some new small touches that I liked. The on/off screen button on the seat control panel is great. A separate USB plug for charging. And there are some new seat settings as well, which are handy given that for the full flat bed position you still need to get up and put the back of the seat down. Which I don’t mind at all. As to the quality of the food and service, it was typical SQ. Excellent. On my return flight am not sitting at the bulkhead. Curious to see how that goes."
2016-09-23,10,10,"""exceeded my expectations""","✅ Verified Review | Fortunate enough to get a real good deal for a Business Class ticket on the inaugural Wellington to Canberra flight on 21 Sept 2016. Check in was quick and efficient, boarding was even quicker. Short Haul Business Class cabin in a 2-2-2 configuration, very comfortable and I found it quite spacious. Cabin crew very friendly as you expect from Singapore Airlines. A little pomp and ceremony being the first every B777-200 commercial flight out of Wellington, the first flight between Wellington and Canberra. Flight was fairly full, only a few seats left here and there. Quick take off and the service began with bubbles of course, food was really tasty and restaurant quality. Cabin crew very attentive, engaging and we had a few laughs along the way too. Flight was smooth, lie flat bed was flat and comfortable, still managed a few zzz's before landing. Seat comfort itself was great and inflight entertainment system, well I didn't try it at all, we were too busy having bubbles and food and laughs. Was a great flight and Singapore Airlines exceeded my expectations on this trip by far!"
2016-09-22,1,1,"""not let instruments as carry on""","✅ Verified Review | Brisbane to London via Singapore. Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it. Apart from the guitar the flight was lovely, food amazing, staff were very friendly and the stewardess knew how to make a mean White Russian! Just wouldn't advise any musicians to take the risk and lose their beloved instrument."
2016-09-12,7,7,"""found the aircraft to be dated""","Cape Town to Ko Samui via Singapore. The flight departed on time, with staff efficient and friendly. The standard and quantity of food offered has dropped. Staff work very hard, are intelligent and friendly. I found the aircraft to be dated, and the inflight entertainment quite limited. The aircraft was spotless, but again the 70's interior feel, and the lack of a decent IFE offer was disappointing. It reminds of the flights I took in the 90's. The seat was comfortable and the leg room was adequate. The second leg to Samui was a standard quick hop from Singapore with a superior plane and staff."
2016-09-07,10,10,"""couldn't fault this flight""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Munich. Check in was great, straight up to the desk. Used the business class lounge which was good to have a bite to eat and relax. This aircraft had the new business class seat and the reviews are right - it is the best business seat I've come across. Heaps of room and your own little compartment. Had 3 course meal before bed. The bed was great with myself 6'4 being able to totally lay stretched out and get hours of sleep. Booked the cook and had the full English breakfast before landing. Couldn't fault this flight one bit."
2016-08-29,9,9,"""a superior travel experience""","✅ Verified Review | I booked a flight from Melbourne to Trivandrum via Singapore. I had a great connection - only 4 hours transit in Singapore. A few weeks later my SilkAir India flight was rescheduled. However Singapore Airlines provided me with a hotel for the day, transfers and meals. So although delayed for a day I got to go sight seeing in Singapore and had a rest at a very nice hotel. Previously I flew Etihad to India via Abu Dhabi. However Etihad has 10 abreast seating on the 777 and it was a 14 hour flight and very uncomfortable. I chose Singapore Airlines for the 9 abreast seating on the 777 and the 8 hour flight to Singapore which was much more enjoyable. The service with Singapore Airlines was excellent including hot towels and fantastic cabin crew. Changi Airport was a beautiful place to visit and Singapore is a beautiful city for a stopover. I totally recommend Singapore Airlines, Silk Air and Changi Airport for a superior travel experience when you have a choice!"
2016-08-26,6,6,"""an average flying experience""","I flew from Brisbane to Beijing to Perth with Singapore Airlines via Singapore. Apart from the one leg on the A380 (PEK-SIN), the other legs were operated by old and tired aircraft with cabin interiors that said as much. The FAs were the usual attentive and professional SQ Girls & Boys and the IFE was ""well stocked"" but I wasn't able to enjoy it because it kept crackling and, on at least two occasions, the movie re-started itself. In the end we got to our destinations safely and on time, I guess. Overall, it was an average flying experience."

The service was horrible with staff not as polite or welcoming as they use to be in the earlier flights experienced. I noticed the standard of service being dropped and the inflight entertainment system was horribly maintained. I ordered a drink from the air hostess but then she said that she wasn't free and would bring it in a while but 30 minutes passed no sight of her nor my drink. The entertainment system remote being beside you at the seat was discomforting as whenever you pulled it your elbows would disturb the person beside you.
2016-08-16,9,9,"""best I have experienced in economy""","London to Denpasar Bali via Singapore. This was my first flight with Singapore Airlines. Both flights were extremely busy but boarding was efficiently handled. The baggage allowance of 30kgs for economy is excellent. We had only a short connection time in Singapore which could have been an issue hadn't the Heathrow flight got in early. Both flights were supposed to have used Terminal 2 in Singapore making in theory the transfer straightforward. The Heathrow flight arrived at Terminal 3 however while the Bali flight left from Terminal 1 which made for a longer transfer. The inflight entertainment system is good but not quite as good as Emirates. I was really impressed with the food and drink offered. I had a curry on the flight to Singapore which was excellent as was the ice cream served as a sweet. There was also a good selection of beers, wines and spirits. Snacks and drinks were available throughout the 13 hour flight to Singapore. The cabin staff were extremely attentive. Overall I was really impressed with the quality of the service and would say it was the best I have experienced in economy from any of the major airlines I have travelled with."
2016-08-15,3,3,"""all seats are changed""","✅ Verified Review | London to Hong Kong via Singapore. Basically everything in the flight is ok but on the ground it does not match any Singapore Airlines standards anymore. First, when I arrived at the terminal ground at Changi airport, the staff told me that all seats are changed since there is an aircraft change. But I remembered when the tickets are booked, it is still an A380 and when I arrived at the gate, the same model appears at the airport. If really there is a better reason to shuffle all our seats even when we book it 3 months before, I think Singapore Airlines should explain to us since we are not the only one complaining at the time."

2016-08-14,10,10,"""hard product and soft product are very impressive""","✅ Verified Review | There's a simple reason why Singapore Airlines is always rated amongst the very top airlines in the world. They're excellent. Both their hard product and soft product are very impressive and consistent which is not easy to achieve. This 17.5 hour flight from Singapore to San Francisco (via Hong Kong) is absolutely heavenly. The 777-300ER has the next gen First Class cabin which is noticeably different from the previous first class. The leather is firmer, the design more fresh with subtle colour adjustments and the seat has many new compartments to store all your onboard 'necesseties'. The IFE has also been completely revamped with a great new remote system which is very intuitive and easy to use. Love that you can now quickly rate movies that you watch. The dining is amazing. As if I was sitting in a fine restaurant in town. I love ordering via Book the Cook for I can specifically choose my meals for every part of the flight. Excellent job SQ."
2016-08-13,8,8,"""it is completely inconsistent""","✅ Verified Review | Although the service and food were excellent on this short, less than two hour flight from Bangkok to Singapore, the plane was the very old 777-200, with the very old business class. The recline chairs upholstered in the dated blueish-purple fabrics. I think Singapore Airlines has only three of these left. I hope SQ gets rid of these planes soon for it is completely inconsistent with their other excellent equipment."
2016-08-12,7,7,"""The service was excellent""","✅ Verified Review | New Delhi to Denpasar via Singapore on business class on Velocity Points Redemption. SQ did not offer A380 business class seats for our travel dates from Delhi. Flight timings were convenient as the flight happened throughout the day bringing passengers into Bali via Singapore by late evening. The service was excellent, barring a negative moment on the SIN-DPS sector. Ground staff in New Delhi were kind to allow me to hand in a package to my driver which I was careless about. They collected it at the gate and made proper inquiries with me before agreeing to handover the envelope to my driver who came to collect it later. SilverKris Lounge in DEL was average in terms or service or offer and reflected the usual attributes of airlines offering mediocre service at Indian airports. Due to Indian regulations no champagne is served on boarding Business Class in India. Flight attendants were friendly and the business class product had no concerns. In-flight entertainment options aren't as large as Emirates, but had an eclectic selection of movies to select from. From SIN-DPS, we encountered a scenario which left a sour taste of the experience. The offered menu had an option of beef. Living in India good beef is hard to come across, so the plan was to indulge in beef on the way to DPS, since beef options were not available on the DEL-SIN sector. On requesting for a beef dish, I was advised that they had run out of beef and was offered the option of chicken or seafood. No apologies or offers to check if an economy meal was available. My partner chose not to have a meal since he wasn't keen on the seafood or the chicken. At this point three members of the cabin crew apologised profusely to him and assured him that they would do anything possible to make things better. At this point my partner asked the crew why the same apologies or service recovery efforts were not made with me, and the crew member simply mentioned, 'I'm sorry but we weren't aware that you were travelling together!' They tried to make up for the error by plying us with drinks and making multiple trips to the seat to inquire of our well-being."
2016-08-10,6,6,"""I'd still prefer Emirates""",Brisbane to Beijing via Singapore. I'd never flown Singapore Airlines before and was looking forward to it. The FAs were attentive on both sectors (BNE/SIN and SIN/PEK) and the food was nice. That's about it. The IFE on both sectors was well-stocked but I found it difficult to hear because it was crackling and kept starting/stopping. Most of the Singapore Airlines reviews must be for business class. I'd still prefer Emirates over Singapore Airlines having now given them a go.
2016-08-09,9,9,"""SIA still sets the standard""","Auckland to Singapore. Very good overall, with the usual attentive and friendly service by cabin crew combined with, on this 2-year old plane, a very comfortable seat - helped by SIA only having 9-abreast seating on the Boeing 777-300ER. Seat back screen (Panasonic) was very generously sized and gave a clear picture, but the instructions were far from intuitive. Even with good headphones, film dialogue was often hard to follow, but after trawling through the buttons trying to select a sub-title option to compensate I gave up and called for cabin crew help. The steward took several minutes to find the magic button, but was himself too confused to explain how he'd found his way to it. That apart, the entertainment selection was extensive and even when the passenger in front reclined her seat the TV screen tilted enough to enable comfortable viewing. SIA still sets the standard for long-haul economy."

I can't really put my finger on it other than it was impersonal, efficient but impersonal. They seemed to be in an awful rush to get us fed and watered and turn the lights off. You didn't see them after that at all and we were in premium economy on the way out. On the way back the flight left at 2am and after hanging around in the airport I was hoping for some good food. However it was not too be ! A sandwich was it ! You could ask for snacks but who wants crisps at 3am ? I felt rather disappointed"
2016-08-01,6,6,"""service was less friendly or warm""","✅ Verified Review | I flew Singapore to Jakarta on 28 June. It was an early morning flight. The cabin crew was professional and working hard on this flight to get the meal service underway and completed despite the short flight duration. The seat felt a little cramped. The food was a slight disappointment and the service was less friendly or warm than what has to come to be expected of such a premium airline. Having said that, the crew was careful in ensuring that the pre-arrival checks are properly carried out (seat belts secured, etc) and that the safety of the passengers are paramount as should be the case."
2016-07-31,4,4,"""I felt dissatisfied and disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Sydney to Amsterdam, returning from Paris to Sydney, both via Singapore in July. I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall."
2016-07-30,9,9,"""frequent drinks brought around""","✅ Verified Review | Barcelona to Sao Paulo. First flight with Singapore Airlines and I was interested to see if travelling with Singapore would be substantially different to the experiences I had with AA/BA. I flew economy but the service in economy with Singapore Airlines was equal to that in business class on AA. The Boeing 777 has a 3-3-3 layout so a bit more spacious for those in economy. We had the bassinet seats at the front as I was travelling with my wife and 3 month old daughter. Food was great, frequent drinks brought around as were snacks and fruit. In flight entertainment great."
2016-07-30,4,4,"""service is anything but premium""","✅ Verified Review | Not so much (if at all) Premium. I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. My experience was nothing like the reviews I have read."
2016-07-28,8,8,"""an above average business class""","✅ Verified Review | Manila - Denpasar via Singapore. Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon. I don't think it's fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas. Service was half a degree warmer than the crew's from the MNL leg, but still a bit robotic for me. Got the nasi lemak via Book the Cook for breakfast and was quite a tasty offering. Less drink runs this time, but it's a shorter flight. All in all, an above average business class experience, but SQ needs to up its game a bit more for the price they charge."
2016-07-25,5,5,"""it is an average experience""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Singapore. My IFE unit screen was not working as the screen went fuzzy and shaky when turned on. The FA tried to restart my system but it did not fix it. As no other seat was available, I was struck with no movie entertainment except for the music for the whole flight. Crew on this flight of the Singapore Airlines standard. They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall, it is an average experience."
2016-07-24,10,10,"""enjoyed our business class experience""","✅ Verified Review | First time we flew Singapore Airlines Business Class from Singapore to Sydney and return. Outbound boarding was on time. But soon after pushed back, the aircraft returned to its parking position due to electrical problem, resulting in one hour delay. Upon took-off all passengers who sat in business class asked the cabin crew to convert our seats to bed mode because it was an after midnight flight. We slept for about 5 hours and were woken up by the FA for breakfast, whereas our daughter was left sleep until half an hour before landing in Sydney. The meals were tasty and glasses were filled up frequently. FA were friendly, except one stewardess looked not so interested in serving us. We landed in Sydney only 20 minutes behind schedule. Inbound flight : Check in process went very fast and served by a friendly ground staff. Boarding was also on time. The cabin crew were friendlier compared with their compatriots in our outbound flight. However, we couldn't sleep/rest due to turbulence weather which we experienced almost the entire journey. All in all we really enjoyed our business class experience with Singapore Airlines."
2016-07-24,10,10,"""know how to pamper their passengers""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Bangkok via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Boarding SQ212 was a breeze after having a cuppa at the lounge. Boarding was fast and FA's greeted everyone by the family name. Pre takeoff drinks was served when we were settled down. Flight was smooth and food was yummy as I preordered under ""My cook"". Wine was offered throughout the meal service. Entertainment is good and the seat even though it is not the latest biz class seat but it is good size. Landed on Singapore on time. For those that transit in Singapore via Singapore Airlines, don't forget to claim your Changi Voucher of S$20 for general retailer and S$20 for liquor, tobacco per passenger. That's S$40 off liquor if you buy in the airport Duty Free Shopping. Singapore Silverkris Lounge is great. I like the space and the food. Love the TWG Tea selection - Singapore Airlines really know how to pamper their passengers. We freshened ourselves up and had coffee and snack before time to board our connecting to BKK. This A333 was a old bird but still in working condition. The FA was really thoughtful to offer cold towel when my partner jokingly mentioned towel should be cold in the reallty warm cabin while she was giving out hot towel. The temperature quickly came down when we were at cruising height. The food out from Singapore on Singapore Airlines is so much better. Flight was delayed a little due to air traffic in Bangkok. Overall, I love the Singapore Airlines Biz Class ."
2016-07-22,4,4,"""inflight service was terrible""",✅ Verified Review | Travelled from New Delhi to Manila via Singapore. The ground crew did not mention anything about the flight delay and did not bother to ask if we had a preferred schedule for our connecting flight. The inflight service was terrible. I asked for earphones from three different flight attendants but was only given one when I typed my request on my iPad. The food was nothing spectacular. The ground crew on my flight from Singapore to Delhi insisted that I have my backpack checked in and argued that it was too big. I have used the same bag on my flights with KLM and Emirates and they allowed me to carry it inflight. I have high regards before with this airline but sadly their service has gone downhill.
2016-07-20,9,9,"""at last someone listened""",✅ Verified Review | Had such a great experience on SQ278 yesterday from ADL to SIN. At last someone listened. As I have allergies I have been given the same chicken breast with carrots etc. After hearing that I have been bringing my own food on board to eat. This crew made their own version of cup noodles with chicken plus they had mushroom soup for me because I mentioned about NZ and CX flights where they made protein shake and chicken soup for me (not on the menu). It's these small little things that can make one happy. Thank you Singapore Airlines. Wish they had wi-fi on board.
2016-07-18,3,3,"""disappointed at inflight service""","Check in at Melbourne Airport was efficient. Terribly disappointed at the inflight service, quality and quantity of food offered (and I don't have a large appetite) plus the age of the aircrafts. SQ tickets are not cheap and not having travelled with SQ in a while, I was so looking forward to my flight given the inflight service reputation which in my opinion has gone to the ""dogs"". Aircraft was old and used my wet towel to clean the tray table and mess. No bar service - just a round of juice, beer and sparkling wine before the meal, which was a beyond belief. Hot casserole and bread and nothing else - not even salad or dessert. Asked the steward for bottle water and was told they only offered tank water. I said I don't drink tank water and he brought me a small bottle from BC. Breakfast was a terrible meal too. On the return one round of Bar service provided this time. Same story with bottle water request and cabin staff brought me a few extra sealed cups of water off other pax trays. Again, horrible breakfast with a hard cold muffin and a poor fruit salad. Seats were small and cramped."
2016-07-18,3,3,"""not be using them in the future""","Perth to Zurich return via Singapore. I booked my flight through a flight partner (Virgin Australia) and before this trip I didn't know how flight partners worked, all it did was give me a headache. I wanted to book in my seats, normally you can do that online, however I was unable to do so either through Virgin's website nor through Singapore Airline's. I called Virgin and they told me I need to speak with Singapore. I called Singapore and requested seats. That worked fine. However on the flight over I didn't realise that sitting right at the back was so noisy, I wore earplugs the whole flight and could still hear the noise, but that was fine, I learned my lesson, but when breakfast came, I was the very last person to be served they ran out of the edible meals and the other meal was some kind of fish (which smelled too strong for a confined space). I normally am one to enjoy all kinds of basic airplane food and am really not fussy, but this was too much. Fish for breakfast? I actually was really unhappy because I never got a choice. Knowing all of this, I decided to change my flight home seat booking, so I wasn't the last person on the plane right down the back near all the noise. I emailed Singapore airlines with the request as soon as I landed. It took a couple weeks until they responded with a stock email saying I need to contact Virgin. I emailed back saying Virgin cannot do this as they dont have access to the seating plan, it is Singapore's job and I know as I have done it before. The email response that returned was the same stock email as they had sent again. This time I was really angry and re-iterated that they should please read the content of my email. Third time and I received the same exact response again. This was now 1 month after my original request (lucky I was away for 6 weeks). I had to find a way to call them while overseas (which was a who other headache) because this was not being resolved online. So I called them and had a very long difficult conversation trying to get the guy to help me as he really wasn't actually listening to what I needed and I was getting frustrated. He finally put in the request for me to get the seats changed and when I told him about the food last time he said he could also request a no seafood meal. So I thought great, I'll do that. On my flight home, the seats were all good but this time I discovered that requesting a non seafood meal means that they dont give you any option at all whatsoever, you just get the eggs, even when the meals being served are chicken or beef with no seafood options! When I asked if I get to choose the normal menu as it already is non seafood, I got an abrupt response about taking the meal from someone else. Gosh I had no idea about all this rubbish. So I learned a lot of things this flight. That Singapore Airlines have terrible online support and rubbish food and no matter what I did it didn't get better. I hear all these great things about Singapore Airlines and its probably fine if things are going ok for you but when they go wrong, they dont help you, not without a lot of effort and frustration any way. I will not be using them if I can help it, in the future. FYI I was going to make a complaint to them on their own site but after going through all I did with their online support last time I feel like its pointless and I am probably wasting my time as no one reads the emails (I can assume)."
2016-07-17,6,6,"""not as good as I expected""","✅ Verified Review | London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good. Maybe I was unlucky, but my trip home was not as good as I expected."
2016-07-17,7,7,"""FAs seemed unconcerned with passengers""","✅ Verified Review | Flew PER-SIN-CDG and then return MUN-SIN-PER. Flight over was good, check in was quick and boarding fairly organized and FAs were attentive from PER. Flew A380 from SIN to CDG and the plane looked tired and there was a film of dust on pretty much every surface - would expect more from a high end carrier like this. Meal service was quite slow, and FAs didn't bother to ask me if I wanted a drink, just breezed past me. Meal collection was also slow - 1 hour to collect trays. Most of the FAs seemed unconcerned with their passengers. Food was OK. Exit Row seats were good, and worth the extra $. MUN-SIN: different story, plane, a 777 appeared cleaner and newer, and FAs were attentive. Sitting not even halfway through the plane, couldn't get my first meal choice on either Dinner or Breakfast. Exit row seats not worth it - cart kept banging into my partner's leg/tv screen as the config of the aisle makes there be a little ""turn"". Window seat on this exit row also has a restricted leg room due to protruding of the exit door. Singapore should rethink this config and do 2-3-2 for the bulkhead to make a bit more space. SIN-PER, FAs attentive, but still meal service was quite slow. IFE on way over seemed good, on the 777 on the way back, new KrisWorld system kept freezing for everyone in my row. Touch screen wouldn't work, then remote, then touch screen. Selection of movies quite broad but TV series lacked a bit of punch. All in all, not a bad trip but if I could fly cheaper on another reputable airline for these destinations, I'd try them out."
2016-07-17,6,6,"""no longer an experience of delight""","✅ Verified Review | I fly for work and do not find Singapore Airlines value for money. Flew from Singapore to Bangkok. The planes are getting old and quality depends on the type of planes. The newest A350 is equally horrible as the cabin space in economy is tightly squeezed to optimise seats for $, but missed out on comfort. The soft touches of SIA being premium such as haagen daaz ice cream, food menus, biz class toiletries pouch or previous-palatable local food in economy have been discarded for margins and this is where I feel SIA have lost their direction/plot. Flying SIA is no longer an experience of delight. One finds too many issues and only is contented to reach the destination safely."
2016-07-15,9,9,"""was a very pleasant flight""","✅ Verified Review | It was a very pleasant flight from Hong Kong to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. They manage their flights well, and almost everything was perfect, from boarding phase until the landing of the flight. They also serve great food and beverages to the passengers."
2016-07-15,2,2,"""aircraft were old and dirty""","✅ Verified Review | Rome to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airline. The aircraft on both sectors were old and dirty. My seat had bread crumbs and coffee stains and was generally uncomfortable. The meal card says sit back and relax in your ""luxury"" seat? It was certainly not in economy class. I was made to believe that Singapore Airlines offered great service however I was unimpressed. Food was average, drinks sparse and you had to ask and wait for a while for them to return with a drink. Some of the flight attendants had no warmth or smile. You would think on long sectors, there would be more attention to service however this was not the case. Overall, disappointing on SQ and would think twice before booking again."
2016-07-13,8,8,"""dinner menu was not provided""","✅ Verified Review | The flight was full after the holidays, hence took a longer time to board and delayed by some 20 minutes. I was surprised that the dinner menu was not provided - rather the cabin crew took the ""chicken or fish"" approach. Not sure if Singapore has ditched the menu for economy class. Food was ok, but seems like they switched to cheaper looking cutlery this year. Also I found the cabin light was inadequate. Again not sure, if it was intentionally kept dim or just the the aircraft was aging. Overall, I felt a bit short of the 5 star service that I am used to getting from SQ. I hope this is an one off experience."
2016-07-12,6,6,"""a bit of a nuisance""","Singapore Airlines was always noted most for their cabin crew attentiveness, you read it still in their proud history in the inflight magazine. I think the slogan was 'Singapore girl, what a great way to fly'. Nowadays if you are lucky enough to be in business you will still come across one of these amazing women. However, you are more likely to get the totally uncommitted new fleet of cabin crew in economy who view the public as a bit of a nuisance and eye contact has gone. Tragedy that whoever is in charge of training cabin staff for this airline is doing a terrible job and losing loyal customers. On my flight, SQ217, Singapore to Melbourne, 10.45 on July 7, I had a rude male steward ever who did not smile once. Back to Qantas for this frequent Australia to Europe passenger."
2016-07-11,9,9,"""more concerned about their timing""","Flew from Singapore to Frankfurt. Seat was very comfortable, with good privacy. Great wine list and very good food. When you are flying First, the only advice to Singapore is to avoid pushing us to eat at their time. It seemed to us that they were more concerned about their timing. That was not suitable at all. Anyway, this had already happened to me flying Singapore on other routes. Singapore flight attendants welcome us in a very distiguinshed manner. Please pay attention in small details regarding your guests specifics and/or timing aboard."
2016-07-10,7,7,"""the service was excellent""","First leg was on one of the older Singapore Airlines 777s that was probably assigned to routes like Singapore - Kuala Lumpur or one of the other regional routes, but the service was excellent and the food was good. The seat was worn out and hard, but SQ is introducing the A350 to JNB. The return leg from JNB was on the 350 so the seat was much more comfortable and the Entertainment system was easier to use, save for the IFE jamming every few hours."
2016-06-30,4,4,"""Premium Economy is totally inferior""",Melbourne to London with Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy is totally inferior compared to Qantas. No private feel to the cabin and no private toilet - just a silly curtain for separation. You have to outright ask for the Champagne which is meant to be part of the privilege of paying double the economy fare. Never again for this former SQ traveller.
2016-06-30,5,5,"""cabin looks a bit tired""","Tokyo to Singapore on board retrofitted B777-300. Cabin looks a bit tired. Seat fabrics looks old and stuffy as well. The thing surprised me even more is the fact that Singapore Airlines significantly reduced its economy class meal standard. On this red-eye flight, there used to be a warm meat wrap and breakfast with main meal, yogurt, crackers, fruit slices and roll and butter. This time, the wrap turned into a cold curry bread, tasted really cheap for sure, and breakfast only contained cheap fruit slices with main meal. FAs also forgot to hand cutleries in to passengers. They also looked a bit tired and unprepared."
2016-06-28,9,9,"""still a quality carrier""",Singapore to Bangkok. Over 10 years since I have been on Singapore Airlines and nothing has changed. Still a quality carrier and on this route well worth the extra money paid over flying with any of the low cost carriers. Generally I fly Oneworld but when the choice is Jetstar I chose to forgo the points and status recognition for service and comfort.
2016-06-23,5,5,"""a little disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Auckland, paid to fly Air New Zealand. Singapore Airlines was the code share. A little disappointed with the Singapore leg which was the return flight. Business class practically empty so crew were not run off their feet. My husband sitting beside me was served quickly but for some reason I was left waiting on both meal times. He had nearly finished before I was attended to. When the meals arrived (dinner and breakfast) they were the worst I have had on a flight. The seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out. The movies are quite a bit out of date and the screens aren't touch screen so hopefully they will eventually have that."
2016-06-17,5,5,"""the crew, they were fantastic""","✅ Verified Review | Saved by the crew. Very excited to be flying Singapore Airlines business class but sadly the reality fell a little short of the expectation. Yes, the seats are massively wide and the leather is lovely but it all feels a little, old in comparison to what's on offer with the Middle Eastern carriers. No turn down service (flight left Melbourne at 1835hrs) though a nice warm doona provided. The seat only has a thin foam pad as an underlay when turned down. Meals were served when they determined, not you. I say ""meals"" though for some reason there was nothing offered coming into Singapore although the menu showed a snack available. I used ""book the cook"" and the fish was sublime but the remainder of the meal was nothing too exciting. There is no toiletry bag though SQ pride themselves on having hand creams and lotions etc in the toilets. Which is fine but we all love a take away from a flight, surely we should be given a choice? Also, no pj's! These days it's just expected. The Silver Kris inflight was pretty poor, limited number of first run (decent) movies, I ended up watching some videos on my iPad. The screen size was quite small in comparison to other aircraft I've been on in J class. But the crew, they were fantastic. Friendly, professional, efficient, calling me by my name every time. 110% to them. Am returning to Melbourne on the A380 in about 10 days, I hope I can give a better account of my return."
2016-06-16,9,9,"""staff incredibly friendly""","✅ Verified Review | Manila to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Both legs of my flight were lovely. The staff were incredibly friendly, the flight only took off 10 mins late due to the late arrival of the plane but made up for time in the air and we arrived on time. Quick service, quite comfortable for economy, the food was great for flight food and would definitely recommend."
2016-06-15,10,10,"""really satisfied with flight experience""",✅ Verified Review | Have not flown with Singapore Airlines for a long time so I was really looking forward to fly with them on this short flight from Singapore to Denpasar-Bali. Both ground and inflight crews were friendly. Food and inflight services were good too! One thing that needs to be updated is definitely the IFE system. Flew on the return leg and was really satisfied with the overall flight experience as well.
2016-06-11,10,10,"""very good at what they do""","✅ Verified Review | Paris to Melbourne via via Singapore. After premium economy to Paris we flew home in Business Class with Singapore Airlines and really enjoyed the experience. Check in at CDG was smooth and we headed to the Star Alliance lounge which is not bad, except getting a seat was a real challenge as it handles so many airlines. Boarding on the A380 was orderly and seated in seats 18 and 19 K on the window. Drinks prior to take-off with French champagne and orders taken for lunch. Flight entertainment was excellent as was the service from a very professional crew. Landed in Singapore about 30 mins early so had time to freshen up in the lounge before boarding for Melbourne. Boeing 777 aircraft with the new Business class seats which again were very comfortable. Daylight flight so had a chance to watch more movies and enjoy the excellent in flight service. Overall you can see why Singapore Airlines are very good at what they do."

Always friendly crew, food was ok but breakfast is not my favorite anyway. The IFE in my opinion had good selection but I think they need to upgrade the moving map, perhaps it is different in a long haul sector but I am not sure. They flew a A330 which was bigger than I thought. Check in was swift and flight took off and landed on time."

Cabin staff very attentive, toilet was clean, amenities superb. I was a little bit disapointed about the food, for moslem just only 1 choice - just chicken. My boy under 2 years got toys but not get food. The entertainment is like the A330, need upgrade for the movies."
2016-06-06,5,5,"""service could be better""","✅ Verified Review | I had an unpleasant trip back to Singapore from Hong Kong. Firstly, the boarding time was 7.15pm. We ended up boarding at 7.30pm. Secondly, the cabin crew were not that friendly. Thirdly, the whole entertainment system was down about 3/4 of the time. Yes, they compensated us with a $75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with Singapore Airlines and there were so many problems. Before take off, the TV that was supposed to show us the safety procedure was disrupted by a technical error. The food was not that tasty compared to Korean Air (who I was flying from Korea to Hong Kong). The ticket I bought was cheap but I believe service could be better."
2016-06-02,1,1,"""complete disregard for passengers""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I was very disappointed at the poor handling of my cancelled flight from SFO to SIN. Myself and a significant number of other passengers were not given any notification about the cancelled flight prior to arriving at the airport. I am also aware of passengers who had been waiting at the airport for more than 12 hours and did not receive any notification from the airline about the cancellation until the last minute. Moreover, despite trying for hours to call their hotline, I was perpetually put on hold. This was also the experience of other passengers. Ground staff refused to open their check-in counters to assist with our enquiries until 9.40pm and even then they were late by 20-30 minutes. Can you imagine the feeling of confusion and uncertainty when the airline was not contactable over the phone or on the ground to tell us whether the flight was delayed or cancelled. I have since written in to the airlines customer service and more than a week has elapsed without any reply or explanation - mirroring the complete disregard for their passengers they displayed during the cancellation."
2016-05-29,7,7,"""service and staff were excellent""","First time on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy from Sydney to Paris via Singapore and as usual with SQ the service and staff were excellent. Boarding in Sydney was well-handled with no pre-take off drink offered. Seated in front row 31A and B with screen on the wall. Food served promptly with drinks offered and juice or water brought around during the flight. Landed in Singapore on time and spent the transit in SQ 1st Class lounge due to Virgin Australia FF Status. Flight to Paris left at 10 past midnight and boarding was a little chaotic with no-one really taking notice of which lane they were supposed to be in. Seated in 33 H and K for the long flight to Paris and noticeably less leg-room than the front row. Cabin was only half-full so some people moved to vacant rows, however due to seat design they couldn't really stretch out. Which comes to my only complaint which is the design of the seats. They would possibly rank as the most uncomfortable airline seats I have ever sat in. They are too short in the squab (where you sit) and the leg rest is almost useless. I would hazard a guess that some seats in economy are more comfortable. Overall if you have only ever flown economy you would probably appreciate the slightly extra leg room and the bigger screens but overall I would save up and fly business class. The other thing with the A380 is you can't rest your head and pillow on the cabin wall as there is quite a gap between the two."
2016-05-25,9,9,"""professional on-time performance""",✅ Verified Review | Adelaide - Singapore - Manila on May 23 in economy class. A very professional on-time performance by all crew. This was my first flight with this airline and I can understand why they have such a good reputation. The only comment is that the entertainment system was not as good as Emirates.
2016-05-20,8,8,"""treat passengers quite well""","✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with Singapore Airlines (SQ12). A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines. Overall though I greatly enjoy taking this flight from Narita to LAX since the A380 is quite comfortable and less prone to the effects of turbulence."
2016-05-11,8,8,"""staff were super attentive""","✅ Verified Review | For a different experience, I decided to try out the new Premium Economy seats from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore return. Between Sydney and Singapore I was in 35A and 31A to Tokyo, the same on the return. There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport."
2016-05-09,6,6,"""abrupt manner of cabin crew""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London Heathrow. Efficient boarding process was let down by abrupt manner of cabin crew on entering the aircraft. Hot towels were almost thrown at passengers. The lack of finesse continued throughout the flight. The meal choices at dinner and breakfast were poor. On this route it is reasonable to expect one western choice of food. Hot drinks were also served with the meal trays, so by the time meals had been eaten he drinks were cold, unlike on other airlines where a separate drinks service is offered."
2016-05-08,9,9,"""they did not disappoint""","Sydney to Singapore return. Hadn't flown Singapore Airlines for six years and they did not disappoint. Boarding on outbound leg in April and inbound in May was organised and effectively monitored in Groups. Service on both flights was friendly and efficient and entertainment program was easy to use with lots of variety. Flew A380 to Singapore and it is so much quieter with slightly bigger toilets and even quieter flush noises than Boeing 777. The food on both legs was tasty, but nothing special. I ordered low sodium meals and I just felt they could have done more regarding how much food you got accompanying the main meal. 3 or 4 slices of Rock Melon and 3 Grapes and a mediocre bread roll, really? But I am being picky as it was more plentiful with Thai and Emirates a few years ago. Maybe times have changed. Did get hot towels though and as I said, service was very friendly and accomodating. Seating also comfy with plenty of leg room in Seat 54C."
2016-05-08,7,7,"""attendants seemed very tired""",✅ Verified Review | Manila to Zurich via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Departure from Manila International Airport was delayed for about 2 hours because of air traffic. During the flight we get dinner. The fish and the desert was delicious but the fried rice was just steam rice. Entertainment programm was outstanding with a large choice of new relesed movies. The flight was very smooth and the flight attendant were very cheerful. After we landed in Singapore I had to hurry to my next connecting flight to Zurich. The flight between Singapore and Zurich was smooth but the meals were one-sided. We get for dinner and breakfast fried rice dish with fish or chicken. I expected at least one noodle dish in this sector. The flight attendants seemed very tired and unmotivated.
2016-05-02,5,5,"""most uncomfortable 15 hours""","✅ Verified Review | Manchester to Singapore on the 4-class Boeing 777-300ER. Outward journey from Manchester on seat 41H, paying extra for so called extra legroom! As this seat faces the aisle in front, a curtain is closed separating Economy from Premium Economy. This means your feet need to be tight against the seat itself as the curtain is less that 18"" almost directly in front meaning your feet are in danger of being tripped over or run over by the trolley. A most uncomfortable 15 hours. The return trip from Singapore on seat 41C was slightly more bearable because the curtain was kept open the entire trip."
2016-05-02,8,8,"""better than envisioned""","✅ Verified Review | Perth to Singapore return. My wife and I thought the flight was fantastic. Our flight to Singapore from Perth was better than envisioned, as they found out it was our anniversary and treated us very well with better seats, champagne and cake when we arrived in Singapore. We were made to feel quite special. Our was return flight was very good as well."
2016-04-30,10,10,"""a fantastic flight""","✅ Verified Review | Taipei to Singapore, and a fantastic flight, well organised boarding led to early departure. Crew friendly and attentive. Quick response to requests with lovely smiles. Great inflight entertainment with large TV and movie/music selections. Meal was tasty (had the black paper beef, veggies, fry rice). Plenty of seating space."
2016-04-28,10,10,"""pleased with positive attitude""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Manila return. On my outbound flight, cabin crew welcome at the aircraft door and they escorted me to my seat and helped to place my hand carry-on bag. I was pleased with the positive attitude that staff displayed throughout the flight. My flight back to Singapore was the same, and my biggest concern was getting a 2 seater window for my friend and I. Onboard the Boeing 777-200, 99% of the aircraft is configured 3-3-3 seating. I highlighted my concerns to cabin crew and she spared no effort trying to find a 2 seater seat in the economy cabin, though she was not able to do so."
2016-04-28,10,10,"""recommend this airline""","✅ Verified Review | Johannesburg to Taipei via Singapore return, and this is the 19th year I have flown with Singapore Airlines, and the standard and the quality of the airline has remained at a very high standard. We always get the seats I reserve for my brother and I, cabin crew friendly, food is very good, and seats are comfortable. Last time when I arrived at Taipei, I was informed (when I reached the baggage collection section) that my baggage didn't come through, it is at Singapore, and the airline said they will sort everything out for me, just need to leave a cellphone number and the address. I received my baggage the following day, which was very efficient. I recommend this airline."
2016-04-27,5,5,"""pretty disappointing""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Singapore Airlines flight 421 Mumbai to Singapore in Economy on a retrofitted Boeing 777-300. Pretty disappointing. Boarding was delayed due to late incoming a/c. But no announcements at all - passengers got agitated when no boarding call was given even after 45 mins after scheduled boarding time, staff seemed a bit nervous. Not expected from SQ at all. Onboard, my IFE (seat 52A) didn't work properly. Screen was grainy and without colour, no audio. Crew tried to reset it, but still in vain. So ended up watching a movie on my mobile. Windows were stained too. Seats not very comfortable, didn't recline well. Not sure if its by design, or due to some technical fault. The check-in staff were very polite. Onboard, food was good. Had ordered Indian Veg meal, was of top quality. Toilets clean even after 4 hours of flight."
2016-04-24,10,10,"""best business class seats""","✅ Verified Review | Copenhagen to Singapore, returning from Singapore to London in business class on Singapore Airlines. Another top experience with SIA. The best business class seats for my 191 centimetres. Good champagne, good wines and pleasant crew. Good entertainment on new screens. And luggage on the belt when walking through no-queue automatic self immigration in Singapore."
2016-04-22,10,10,"""not hesitate to use again""","Singapore Airlines is deserving of a 5 star rating. Flew from Surabaya to Bangkok via Singapore. Food is the best I've tasted on an airline, flights left and arrived on time or early. The cabin crew were friendly, attentive and professional and quickly responded to the call button. The facilities, ambiance and efficiency at Singapore Airport should be the envy of all airports worldwide. Although the final leg of my journey from Singapore to Surabaya was with their subsidiary Silkair that uses short-haul aircraft without the entertainment facilities of Singapore's long-haul services, they couldn't be faulted either given the flight was short-haul. Overall I will not hesitate to use Singapore Airlines again and would happily pay a premium to go with them over one of their competitors."
2016-04-22,7,7,"""staff were efficient and friendly""","Flew Singapore Airlines from London Heathrow to Singapore. Check was smooth at priority desk. I was offered a change to a front row seat which I accepted. Big mistake. Although giving extra leg room theses seats do not have foot rests, which render the leg rests very uncomfortable. The cabin staff were efficient and friendly. Sadly the meals served were not good. My pork main course was tough and stringy. There was no dessert only a minute piece of cheese, and some equally minute crackers. The breakfast was better, but my hot dish was served cold. The premium above economy fare, I expect a much better standard of meals."
2016-04-22,8,8,"""cabin crews friendly""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne - Singapore, SQ218, 16 April 2016, 40K. Had a bit of trouble with check-in, I could not check in online due to age restrictions as I'm under 18. If they don't permit me to check in online they should do something to the app because I could check in on my phone's app. Onboard, supper was good, amenities were good and seats were fine. Breakfast was delicious and cabin crews friendly. The IFE in my seat didn't work very well especially for videos. Overall this was a great flight, arrived 1 hour early allowing more leisure time at Changi."
2016-04-20,9,9,"""food quality was better""","✅ Verified Review | Bali to Bangkok via Singapore. I could have flown direct but found a very competitive fare on Singapore Airlines. Slightly delayed departing and arriving into Singapore. This was due to air traffic not the airline. The Captain was very prompt in keeping the passengers up to date. Three flights on the A330 and one on the Boeing 777-200. I did prefer the A330, the leg on the 777 was full and as always the crew worked hard. Food quality was of a better standard than my last SQ flight. It does show a huge standard between catering out of Singapore and some other destinations. Will continue to fly SQ."
2016-04-19,7,7,"""service and cabin crew nice""","✅ Verified Review | Took this flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on a business trip. Nice and real business class in a bit of an older style. Service was great. While service and the cabin crew were nice, I was quite unhappy with the cockpit crew. Upon departure the pilot talked about fair weather conditions, nothing unusual. He did not mention with any word that we need to be seated for 2 hours and being shaken around in turbulence. It even got that bad that the captain got the cabin crew seated because he said it is too dangerous for them to walk around. But 5 minutes after that, the captain comes out to go to toilet? It is not a shame to tell passengers that there may be turbulence en route."
2016-04-18,9,9,"""smooth and pleasant""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore. I found the flight very enjoyable and on par with previous flights with Singapore Airlines. Check in on both the going and return trip was smooth and pleasant. The theme was reflected across the rest of the flight meaning at no point was I left feeling stressed or perturbed. I especially enjoyed the return flight from SIN to DXB since they had used a newly refurbished 777-300ER which had all the new bells and whistles, incl. touch screen IFE and refreshed seats. While I did not use the in-flight Wi-fi, it was good to know it was available and operating."
2016-04-17,9,9,"""grateful for their assistance""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Perth and return. We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name when we boarded the plane. Crew took time to make my kids feel comfortable on the flight. Cabin lights were turned off about an hour after the flight and then breakfast was served at about 4am. Unfortunately, my husband was taken ill shortly before landing – thankfully there was a doctor sitting just across the aisle from him. The crew was amazing – they thought and took care of every little detail. My kids and I were given assistance through the airport, and even helped into the taxi to go to the hospital. I didn’t manage to get anyone’s names but I am very grateful for their assistance. SQ214: Again, impressed with service. Senior crew was outstanding, some junior crew seemed a bit indifferent. Seats on both flights were comfortable and acceptable for a medium haul flight (they were angled flat seats ie. old business class). For anything more than 7 hours, a full flat would be perfect. Selected breakfast from book-the-cook for SQ225 flight, which was delicious. IFE kept the kids entertained the whole time."
2016-04-16,2,2,"""no longer a top tier airline""","✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Milan via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. A waste of money! Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline. I take 3-4 long haul trips between Australia and Europe per year and will never fly Singapore Airlines again!"
2016-04-16,9,9,"""seat was comfortable""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Singapore to Manila return. We got very good fares by booking several months in advance. The ground staff at the check-in counter at Manila airport was very friendly. Service by the senior crew on both flights were outstanding, the junior staff seemed a bit indifferent. There was a slight issue with my child's meal on the return flight (her meal contained pork, which we don't consume so it was exchanged for a seafood meal) which was taken care of by the crew once notified - happy with that service recovery. Everything else was as expected from Singapore Airlines. Seat was comfortable for the short flight, the IFE was great and kept the kids entertained."
2016-04-11,10,10,"""cabin crew are always immaculate""","Second time flying to Australia from London Heathrow with Singapore Airlines, and I must say their Economy Class product is definitely a cut above. The use of the big A380 is a tremendous boon, as it is configured for far fewer passengers than it could actually carry, therefore seat pitch and width are set at very comfortable distances. Long-haul is never pleasant, so anything that goes towards alleviating the pain is most welcome. The cabin crew are always immaculate, helpful, friendly and courteous, and the meals are not too bad either. Entertainment system has extremely wide choice. Last but not least, their fares are much lower than any of their major competitors, which is surprising given the quality."
2016-04-10,10,10,"""seat was quite comfortable""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to New York JFK via Frankfurt. The cabin staff are friendly and responsive with what I requested. The seat was quite comfortable, they also provide blanket, pillow, eyeshades, earplugs, playing cards for the kids and more. The inflight entertainment was awesome with latest movies. However the ticket is quite expensive because I'm a traveler which likes to accrue 100% miles when I'm flying. And maybe if it's possible for the wi-fi and internet connection they should give as a complimentary for the guest who does not a promotion ticket."
2016-04-08,10,10,"""service was top notch""","✅ Verified Review | Brisbane - Singapore, the flight was smooth, the service was top notch, very professional from entry to exit, nothing was left unturned. It was a red eye flight but the cabin crew were still active throughout the cabin. This is why they're sitting at second place in top 10 airlines in 2015. My only problems were the seat was kind of small for my size but that what you get for flying economy, the in-flight entertainment had a good selection of movies but the screen I felt wasn't clear in this day and age where HD is supreme and lastly the meal was smaller then I remember on my last Singapore Airlines flight 10 years ago. Overall highly recommended airline."
2016-04-06,8,8,"""an enjoyable experience""",Red eye flight SQ402 to Delhi from Singapore. Flight was full. Supper was served a while after airborne. There were lots of special meals requested and the Cabin Crew were efficient and managed to finish everything within 2 hours. Nothing after that except of a round of water in the middle of the flight. Return to SIN on a newer A333. Comfortable seats and better inflight entertainment. A round of drinks before lunch. Overall an enjoyable experience with Singapore Airlines.
2016-04-04,4,4,"""entertainment system wasn't working""","✅ Verified Review | Pretty unhappy with Singapore Airlines. I was expecting to watch some movies during my flight between Singapore to Tokyo since I can't sleep during flights, then I took to my seat and the entertainment system wasn't working, called couple times the cabin attendant and after 2 hours what I get was ""Sorry, would you like to have a magazine or something to read? We trying to reset your system"". Then nothing, after this no one came back to say something. Give up to sleep and my flight all way down to Tokyo was boring. They give me a voucher for 75 Singapore Dollar which made me more angry."
2016-03-30,1,1,"""changed my seat reservation""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Paris. I am very disappointed by the service rendered by Singapore Airlines to their Economy Class passengers. First, they changed my seat reservation for my long-haul flight from Singapore to Paris. As a result, I ended up not being able to rest much on the plane. When I queried them on this change upon my arrival in Paris, they sat on my query and took more than two months to reply with a respond that doesn't shed much details on what went wrong. It has been 87 days and I am still awaiting a satisfactory response. Having endured an unpleasant flight and getting no clarification on what happened has made me feel like the airline doesn't value or care about the interests of their Economy Class passengers. Given their relatively higher fares even for Economy Class, I would urge customers to think twice if they are intending to fly Economy Class with the airline."
2016-03-27,9,9,"""was very pleased with the service""",✅ Verified Review | I booked a flight on Singapore Airlines on the 18 March 2016. I checked in at Manila NAIA Terminal 3 and the check in staff provided excellent Customer service. I was very pleased with the service provided by the cabin crew as they paid a lot of attention to the passengers needs. IFE needs to be updated to cater to the needs of passengers. I was unfortunate to experience the first generation IFE Tv monitor on my flight. I feel that the airline needs to upgrade their IFE to ensure passengers are well taken care of. I will definitely fly again with them!
2016-03-25,10,10,"""excellent service, food and IFE""","✅ Verified Review | Excellent service, food, and entertainment options for this short 2.45 hour Singapore Airlines flight from Yangon to Singapore. Cabin crew were friendly, enthusiastic and professional. AVOD available, with a great selection of entertainment. Hot towels were served shortly after take-off, followed by a generous cooked lunch."
2016-03-24,8,8,"""a beautiful looking plane""","✅ Verified Review | Flew economy on Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return this week. By chance, both flights used the new A350-900 fleet. For such short route, I guess it's partly to test the new planes. Not too bad an experience on the new planes. Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class. Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so it's not a coincidence). Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments. Other than the beautiful outlook and smooth cruise in the air, the interior comfort falls short of expectations."
2016-03-24,9,9,"""crew provides outstanding service""","✅ Verified Review | Manila to Singapore in Singapore Airlines Business class. Great service starts at check-in and continued to the Silver Kris lounge before actually boarding the aircraft. The lounge at Manila Airport T3 was a good relaxing space, with comfortable seats and excellent range of drinks. The aircraft was aging A330, and while crew provides outstanding service, the aircraft cabin was quite touched by time. As usual, delicious dinner, a movie and 3.5 hours of flying was a breeze."
2016-03-23,9,9,"""crew were very relaxed""","✅ Verified Review | Dhaka to Melbourne via Singapore, flights operated by A330-300. Check in at Dhaka was fast and professional, the 3rd party lounge there was reasonable. Flight packed but crew were good. IFE good. Did not eat so cannot comment on food. Singapore to Melbourne with a professional crew, the flight was not full which meant crew were very relaxed. Good drink service and tasty food. Bags out in no time."
2016-03-22,6,6,"""Food and IFE average""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Check in fast and swift, and a good Lounge in Melbourne. A333 from MEL to SIN departed on time, and had plenty of room to spread around as flight was relatively empty. IFE good. Did not eat on this flight and cannot comment on food. Singapore lounge in Terminal 2 so so, and looks more like a canteen. SIN to DEL red eye operated by a Boeing 777-200 which was refitted. Packed flight and crew not as good. Food and IFE average. Not bad flights but won't say they were very good either."
2016-03-22,7,7,"""overall an enjoyable flight""","✅ Verified Review | A very pleasant journey on Singapore Airlines last December for my trip from Singapore to Guangzhou. The flight time was around 3hr 55mins and it was just as pleasant as my other trips with SIA. The food was decent for Economy class, cabin hygiene great, seat very comfortable, foot space also quite decent for a passenger in Economy and it's also a plus to provide foot rest. The only difference from my last trip is that Singapore Airlines replaced the IFE headphones to more compact earbuds which don't fit very well in my ears, and the audio is slightly poorer than expected. It was overall an enjoyable flight."
2016-03-20,10,10,"""service was attentive""","Singapore Airlines from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney via Singapore. KUL-SIN as usual, a short routine flight so nothing to complaint about - service is good. Singapore to Sydney, I was on a Boeing 777 for a change. The flight was outstanding, crew fantastic and service was attentive. Meal was beyond expectations - I had the seafood pre-order meal and one of the best meals I have had on board. Overall, good service and food."
2016-03-20,8,8,"""delicious Japanese meal""","Tokyo to Los Angeles. I was impressed as they have added more drinks choices to economy class. The ANA lounge at Narita was amazing. Sitting next to me onboard is a couple with baby and cabin crew paid more than enough attention to the baby and his parents. Delicious Japanese meal, but the breakfast before arrival was a so-so pork sausage, so-so tiny fritata and three pieces of roast potato. I got this return flight for only USD750 with 100% mile accrual, so more than satisfied."
2016-03-19,4,4,"""seating was a big let-down""","Adelaide to London via Singapore was my first experience of Business Class on Singapore Airlines A380, and I was disappointed. Food, IFE, crew etc. were fine (though nothing exceptional) but the seating was a big let-down. With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired; I don't know how old this particular aircraft was, but Singapore Airlines started flying A380's in 2007, and this one was showing its age. All in all, their A380 Business Class accommodation is in need of a radical update."
2016-03-14,10,10,"""I was really impressed""","London to Singapore return, connecting to Silk Air flights to Cambodia. I'd flown them once before and found them to be outstanding, and this time I was really impressed. Two enjoyable and comfortable flights. T2 at Heathrow is quiet, quick check-in/security and some good food options. Onboard, cabin staff are fantastic, and throughout the flight maintain a visible presence, coming around multiple times during lights out with drinks or snacks for anyone who is awake. The food is tasty, three options for lunch/dinner and two for breakfast, and both the menu cards and metal cutlery are welcome touches. Planes comfortable and clean. The A380 is wonderfully quiet, but the seat comfort and IFE system on the Boeing B777 is actually superior and I'd pick the latter given a choice of aircraft. IFE superb with a wide variety of films. Amenities in economy is quite basic compared to some other airlines (socks, toothbrush, pillow, blanket). At the Singapore end, Changi airport is a traveller's dream - if there's a better airport anywhere in the world, I look forward to finding it."
2016-03-13,7,7,"""service was good""","Paris-Singapore return. I had prebooked seats in exit row (special fare for such reservation with Singapore Airlines). Both flight we had 81H/81K on upper deck. Service was good, seats fine only limitations are that the on board entertainment offering of poor quality and regular minor freeze of video. The IFE remote control old and cumbersome. Food and wine was nothing exceptional compared to other airlines which are also 5-Star. Inflight mobile service not operational (eg data roaming, sms)."
2016-03-12,9,9,"""food onboard excellent""","Very enjoyable journey with Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to London via Singapore. I've flown this route a couple of times with the airline now and service onboard is above expectations. The type of aircraft was changed after my booking, which was slightly disappointing as it was originally an A380. Food onboard excellent and the entertainment was good too. Seats are comfortable and there were some empty seats so passengers could spread out. Surprisingly there was loads of extra overhead locker space."
2016-03-06,9,9,"""among the best airlines""","Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, and I booked this flight because I regard Singapore Airlines as among the best airlines - yet is was cheaper than Malaysia Airlines. And because I had 3 hours transit in KUL, so I wanted a decent lounge to wait in, which served alcohol (unlike MAS) and food. The lounge wasn't that great; a bit cramped with no facilities to change clothes, never mind shower. Boarding was smooth. Surprised that only soft drinks served before takeoff, and inflight there was no champagne. A hot wrap was offered to eat, but I declined as I wasn't hungry. Cabin crew were great and well turned out. The seat was very good and would have suited a much longer flight than this - comfortable and spacious it was a shame to leave it after just a 45 mins sector, to board my 13 hour BA flight to London in a Club seat that was 4.5"" narrower."
2016-03-01,9,9,"""worth it's 5-Star rating""","Hong Kong to Auckland via Singapore. Hong Kong to Singapore final call was made 30min before departure time but flight departed 1hr late to schedule. Crew were nice and helpful. IFE system was user friendly and had a large screen, flight map didn't work when landing. Movies were available in different language subtitles but more different types of movies could be included. Meal was delicious with decent amount. Paper menu was distributed before meal. Flight landed in Singapore 45min late which made our transit time a bit tight. Next flight was the same plane. Crew were polite and helpful. Hot towels were distributed. Legroom was decent with a footrest. Amenity kit was distributed. Two meals were tasty. Drinks and sandwiches were given between meals. Flight arrived in Auckland 5 min early. Singapore Airlines is worth it's 5-Star rating."
2016-02-29,4,4,"""one rare flight""","Flew from London Heathrow to Singapore Changi. With Singapore Airlines, there is always this high standard that most airlines aspire to achieve in terms of service. And because of this I am compelled to write one especially when they fall below their own minimum standards. This is one rare flight where the air stewardess was rude to a passenger, never smiling (forgiveable) and non apologetic when it came to dropping cutleries on her. To top it up, she even pouted annoyingly when the passenger was not awake when meal was served. Rare indeed, and ultimately undid all the good things her colleagues did on this same flight."
2016-02-26,8,8,"""I cannot fault them""","Denpasar to Taipei via Singapore with Singapore Airlines - every flight I have taken with SQ just seems to get better and better. A quality airline in all aspects. They aim to please and do it well. From the first welcome on board to the start of the food service, I cannot fault them. Meals are beautifully presented and tasty. The crew in particular on the Singapore to Taipei segment need special mention - they were outstanding. You will definitely see me onboard another Singapore flight soon."
2016-02-25,6,6,"""airline itself is top notch""","Munich to Sydney via Singapore. The booking process was quite tedious. Unfortunately I booked via phone and constantly got different information regarding pricing, flight policy etc. The flight was really expensive for economy class (1800€) but it was a high season booking. I made a date change and despite cheaper flights having become available online due to the season change (400-500€), I had to keep my expensive rate (if the flights become more expensive when you change dates you have to pay the difference (I was told the difference is not refundable when cancelling the flight!) - but if the flight becomes cheaper then it's tough luck for you. I think that is really bad and has put me off. Some reservation staff are helpful but others have no clue what they are doing. Airline itself is top notch and cabin crew lovely. Seats could be more comfy and have more legroon. If I book with them again, then only online - then I have control over what I am doing. Next time I will try another 5 star airline though - when I flew they were up to 600€ cheaper."
2016-02-24,9,9,"""meals were delicious""","Flew Amsterdam - Singapore and Singapore to Perth with Singapore Airlines in economy. Still very satisfied with flying this airline. I did not notice a decline in service and overall product quality comparing with my SIA flights in the past. Two minor differences: no more headphones but airphones and no drinking glasses on the meal tray but plastic cups. In fact I like the airphones which suppress the airplane noise a bit more. Plastic cups not really an issue but I prefer glass. More importantly: they still serve the cotton hot towels which is a real pleasure. Legroom was decent and the meals were delicious and nice presented. Service on the Amsterdam-Singapore leg and vice versa was of a very high level and consistent. I really appreciate the hard working cabin crew, nothing is too much trouble to ask for. When you push the service button an attendant comes to you generally within twenty seconds. What really surprises me is that they do not forget anything. When I asked for an extra bread or drink during the busy meal services they always came back to satisfy me. I have done this quite a few times and was never disappointed. Very different from my experience with other airlines. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the Singapore-Perth leg and vice versa were a little less attentive. Still good but not exceptional. Meal services took a bit longer and I think this is due to less crew than on SIA's long haul flights. I am happy with this airline and would like to fly in their new A350. Hopefully they will not decline economy services after the roll-out of premium economy. It is all in the details."
2016-02-24,8,8,"""doing some cost-cutting""","I have been a loyal customer for about 10 years, and a member of Krisflyer (now Gold) since 2009. This flight is quite disappointing, because cabin crew members were not able to nicely manage a full flight. The flight was full, as it continued from Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin crew distributed wrong menus to passengers (Los Angeles - Tokyo - Singapore menu instead of Singapore - Tokyo - LA). I remember SIA used to give out Haagen Dazs ice creams and now they have changed it to cheaper brands made in Thailand. There also used to be crackers and cheese and none of them are present with economy meals now. I still recommend this airline but it is now doing some cost-cutting measures, and service may not be as nice as it used to be."
2016-02-23,9,9,"""standards were still good""","Adelaide to Singapore. It had been a few years since using Singapore Airlines and it was good to see that standards were still good. Staff helpful, seat comfortable and a good return flight. The Adelaide Office staff were very helpful and will be using them again. They give good advice, and if fare is cheaper online, they will tell you."
2016-02-22,8,8,"""flight was pleasant and clean""","This is the first flight of the day from Singapore to Perth. Flight was full but we were all able to board and take off on time. Hot towel was served shortly but no drink offer after on this morning flight. Meal service commences after we reached cruising height. As it is a full flight, they made an announcement to apologize if the choice breakfast is no available. I had my pre-ordered seafood meal which was served before the main meal service. But somehow Singapore Airlines crew always didn't ask those who had special meal any drink when the cart is at the row when they offer the rest. Overall the flight was pleasant and clean."
2016-02-22,9,9,"""but could smile more""","Sydney to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. My first experience on Singapore Airlines A380. The cabin crew were very attentive, friendly, but could smile more. They addressed me by my name and dealt with a few difficult passengers professionally. IFE has an excellent selection. The seats are comfortable (I o had the whole row of 4 to myself!) with handy power sockets on every seat. Food was amazing and beef rendang cooked to perfection . The Singapore Sling is a must try."
2016-02-17,1,1,"""2 out of 2 flights delayed""","On the way from Milan to Ho chi Minh via Singapore the first flight was delayed, many passengers missed their connection and I had to rush to catch mine. Even worse, on the way back to Milan, the flight from Hanoi to Singapore (operated by SilkAir) delayed again. I arrived at Singapore 30 minutes before the departure of the flight to Milan, but the ground staff told me that the next gate was too far away to be reached on time and that the airplane could not wait and neither they could help me to reach it in a quickest way! Of course they had booked for me a new flight, 2 days later! I go to the transfer lounge asking for another option to fly back to Italy earlier, even offering to change my destination and showing them all the possible option that there were. The answer I receive is that they cannot put me in other airlines' flights. So I'm forced to spend the night in Singapore, without having the possibility to collect my suitcase amd withouth any certainty that it will arrive to Milan with me. Having 2 delayed flights out of 2 flights is unacceptable."
2016-02-17,8,8,"""weight restrictions ridiculous""","Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles. I have been traveling back to Singapore via different airlines in the last 30+ years and I like Singapore Airlines the best in services, seat, cleanliness, in flight entertainment, inflight and ground staff are friendly and helpful. I give them a 4.5 stars, foods are better other airline but still need improvement especially the fish menu. However, the weight restrictions on carry-on bags is ridiculous, only a total 11lbs for 2 bags. As camera, batteries, memory bank, power bank, laptop, iPad are not able or allow in the check-in lugguage, so you have to put them in the carry-on bags. All these items can easily add up to more than 11lbs. With this unreasonable weight restrictions, I give it a 3.5 - 4 on the scale of 5 (stars) or a rating of 7-8 on the scale of 10."
2016-02-15,10,10,"""looked after graciously""","Hong Kong to to Denpasar via Singapore. I can see why this is a five star airline. Arriving in Hong Kong on an international flight long distance flight and then boarding Singapore, one notices they are ahead of their competitors. Once onboard you are looked after graciously and with care. Food is wonderfully presented. The entertainment Kris World is the best in the in my opinion."
2016-02-14,7,7,"""cabin crew was wonderful""","Hong Kong to Jakarta via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew was wonderful, plane was clean and food and entertainment was great. SIN-CGK the entertainment wasn't working in my seat and i can't even view mapping. The food was good on both routes, but the IFE on HKG-SIN route was really excellent. It works well. I will still recommend this airlines."
2016-02-10,8,8,"""seat was very comfortable""","Singapore to Guangzhou. Boarding was divided into zones, which made boarding very smooth. The seat was very comfortable, good legroom and width. I like the independent cup holder and the small mirror at the tray table. Personal TV screen was big, quality wasn't bad, and a lot of selection. I would like to give 5-star to SIA cabin crew but one cabin crew me a bad impression. She showed a bad attitude. The meal served is good. Cost only 380 Singapore Dollar for return trip, it's totally worth it."

All of the staff were extremely helpful and took good care of me. They were professional and very caring to my well being. I would like to thank them for their dedication. I would use Singapore Airlines whenever I go back to Australia.
2016-02-04,9,9,"""comfortable and spacious""",Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Hanoi. Good start to this flight was in the lounge. Great choice of food - and unlike the BA equivalent at LHR - plenty of space and not over-crowded. Flight took off on time to the minute. Regional business class seat was great for the 3 hour flight. Comfortable and spacious. FAs address you by name. Cabin not even half full. Great customer service. Lovely appetizer of chilled prawn salad. Main course of blackened chicken was excellent. Wine chilled perfectly (unlike BA First Class last week LHR/Sin). All in all a great experience.
2016-02-01,7,7,"""crew were welcoming""","Jakarta to Johannesburg via Singapore, and this was second long haul flight with Singapore Airlines in the last 2 months. I arrived early in Jakarta and was very pleased when they put me on an earlier flight. The crew were welcoming and worked hard on this short sector. I paid for the preferred seat on the Singapore to Johannesburg leg, and although the leg room is great you are next to the central toilet block on this type of aircraft. The food on the return flight was terrible and even the first meal served approx an hour after take off was inedible. Thankfully the breakfast on the Singapore to Jakarta leg was fresh and tasty."
2016-01-31,10,10,"""food was amazing""","Singapore to Bali and was not disappointed. A simple touch as welcoming you by name as you board makes you feel awesome (I’m a Solitaire PPS flyer). Singapore Airlines uses the A330-300 on this 2 hour flight, with it’s regional business class seat, which is perfect for this route. If you’re going to nap on such a short flight, I don’t mind the angle-lie-flat seat. The food was amazing. The one thing that is getting a little bit old and tired on this plane is the KrisWorld IFE system. I think this is due for an overhaul."
2016-01-31,10,10,"""attentive and friendly""","Adelaide to Tokyo via Singapore. Excellent dedicated check in for Premium Economy and Business Class and staff friendly and efficient. Boarding was efficient with lines for Elite Gold and Premium Economy Passengers. Seat was well cushioned and very comfortable. More then enough legroom with an extended footrest. Compartments on either side of the seats for mobile phones and other small devices. Compartment in the front of the seat large enough to fit a 15 inch laptop and an iPad. Smaller spaces in the console can easily fit 2 water bottles. Tray tables extend out of the centre console. Entertainment was standard with a 13 inch HD screen and a fantastic selection of movies and a less than desirable selection of TV Shows. Flight Attendants were attentive and friendly, doing checks of the cabin and there if you needed anything. Food was sufficient but I wouldn't say it was anything impressive. Beverage selection was fairly extensive even serving champagne before take off. WiFi was expensive and only came with 30MB but the ability to use roaming services on board was good."
2016-01-30,9,9,"""wish SIA did random upgrades ""","Singapore to Seoul is a flight I take very often for work and I'm never disappointed. I think the key of success is their consistency. Changi Terminal 3 has a dedicated check-in area for KrisFlyer Gold / Star Alliance Gold members. Check-in is always swift and quick. Selection of seats remains free except for a few exit row seats in the plane . As a KrisFlyer Gold, you can use the KrisFlyer Gold lounge which is usually packed. Food and drinks are adequate. I wish there were a few more spaces more conducive to do work and also shower facilities seem to be missing from the home base lounge. Singapore Airlines now use the group boarding system. I'm not sure if this really makes boarding efficient, but it clearly had lines for priority boarding which I try to take advantage of. The A330 is well maintained and clean. Seats in economy are comfortable with very good IFE. A hot towel is provided upon boarding and a menu, the food is nice and on the SIN to ICN segments, they offer a Korean dish which is a nice touch. The only thing I wish is that SIA did a bit more random upgrades that some airlines offer to their frequent flyers. My wife is also a gold member for another Star Alliance airline and she will get consistent upgrades and that's a really nice reason to continue to fly with a specific airline."

ADL to SIN Boarding was delayed due to technical issues, it took a bit longer then normal but staff handled it effectively and apologized for the inconvenience. Standard Singapore Airlines Economy Seat, very comfortable with a pillow and blanket provided. Legroom was plentiful and pitch was standard. Entertainment options for movies was very good, lots of movies and up to date, Television shows were limited and only had full seasons from select shows. Inflight service overall was very attentive and friendly, staff go that extra mile to make the journey more comfortable. Food and drinks were standard, nothing impressive."

The meals were standard aircraft food, seats comfortable enough and cabin crew very attentive and approachable. Aircraft was reasonably clean too. Could do better by improving the cleanliness of toilets. For the price paid, I am happy on overall service from Singapore Airlines."

I expressed my fear of flying on the A380 because it was a huge plane. The FA reassured me and was able to comfort me despite the fact that it was a rather a bumpy flight. Often, one of the female Flight attendants would come up to me and asked if I was feeling alright. The food served was greatly prepared and Im satisfied. The seats were comfortable and I enjoyed inflight entertainment."

However, the ground staff at Changi airport promised that my luggage will get into the afternoon flight to SFO and will be sent to my house on the same night. I did what they told me in making a lost luggage report at SFO with their ground staff. I waited that night for my luggage and nothing show up. I call the number they provided and it goes into voicemail despite a number of attempts. Try calling the general customer service line and they told me to call the same number. Told them that the number could not get through and the response that I got was they can't do anything. Tried calling the number again the next morning, same situation, voicemail. Finally, in the afternoon they called me back and said they have located my luggage and is on its way. I got my luggage the next day at nite. Is more than 30 hours. No apology offered by them. Really disappointed."

Was addressed by name and crew came around and served drink in Premium Economy from a tray which was a nice touch. Singapore Airlines service remains constantly high. Both food and entertainment of an excellent standard. I managed to sleep for 8 hours of the 12 hour flight. Only downsides are that the WiFi is expensive for the amount of data you get which means I didn't test it, and although there are 2 USB charging points there is no conventional power point. The flight departed and arrived on time."

The night flight on an A333 was not fully booked - just about 70%. I was impressed by the efficiency and quality of service plus the smiles I got from time to time. On this flight of almost 4 hours they offered a full meal with the choice of European/international or Asian/local fare - plus a menu card. The food and the wine were tasty, got one or even two refills and felt fine . Arrival ahead of schedule, swift procedures. Once again a flight on the level they are famous for, they earn their five stars."
2016-01-11,9,9,"""seat width very large""","London Heathrow to Singapore Changi onboard Singapore Airlines A380 on the top deck in business class. Seat width very large and about 1.5x bigger than BA's offering on their A380. Seat turned over to create a proper bed with white cotton sheet and duvet and two pillows. TV big and movies were the usual Hollywood classics and recent releases. Dinner was superb - chicken satay canapé followed by crab salad and then duck rice for main with a dessert and fruit / cheese platter to follow. Where BA had the edge over Singapore was in the wine and champagne selection - BA offering 4 champagnes over Singapore's mere one champagne (Tattingger 2007). Also Singapore gave no amenity bag and instead gave the standard economy class sock, eye shade and slippers - I've had better amenity kit in economy in Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, BA to name a few. The magazine selection was poor as well with no suitable magazines for men under 35 years like myself. Service was tip top with attention on tap and lots of pleasing to my requests for their fine TWG tea selection. All in all a much better seat than BA given Singapore do a 1-2-1 config on business vs BA cramped 2-3-2. Would choose Singapore Airlines again so long as price was similar to BA."

Why the check in staff decided to put a couple in the center 2 seats of the 4 seat center row, with 2 men flanking us, on a long flight after already being in transit for 13 hours is beyond me. Very difficult to go to the toilet or even move at all. If they had put us on the side of the row we could have helped each other and not try to convince a strange man who cannot understand you or is asleep to let you up. This made a 22 hour travel day a lot harder than it needed to be. Staff on the aircraft could have assisted with the problem also."
2016-01-07,8,8,"""more an economy plus""","Munich to Singapore and my first time in the new Singapore Airlines premium economy cabin, which we seemed to have gotten at the same price as economy when we booked - so that will skew the value for money rating. Staff were friendly, the meals ordered using book the chef were great and the champagne which is poured on request is a nice touch. The seat itself is comfortable with very good leg room I did expect more recline and given the length of time Singapore Airlines waited to introduce premium economy, I expected more. To put this in context I think their economy class is a very high quality product. The new IFE was excellent with a wide range of programs to keep you entertained. Overall I would say that it is an economy plus more than a business minus product."

The food was the best airline meal I've had. They don't spend too much on individual amenities kits (they only have sleep mask, slippers and socks). Overall, I would recommend this airline."

There was a special transfer desk in the terminal, and the guy manning it was really friendly. On to the flight itself, my seat was very comfortable and food was of sizable portions and tasty. Krisworld was a joy to use and there were many video and audio options. The flight attendants were the key to a good flight, as they were so attentive, coming around offering snacks and drinks throughout the flight. They also responded to requests promptly. My only peeve was that the couple in front recline their seat all the way the whole time, including during meal times, or throw your blankets under your seat so that it eats up the space of the passenger behind you. Not to say, of course, that this was SIA's fault at all."

Service was polite, efficient and functional. We ordered muslim meals and the food was deplorable. This has generally been my experience with special meals on Singapore Airlines. Entertainment selection was very extensive. However, irritatingly, the content was badly organized requiring one to carefully browse through the material. On DEL-SIN we flew economy class. Surprisingly, the food improved. Experiences with service and entertainment were the same."

Great crew in economy with hot towels, food and beverage menus distributed. Plenty of drinks and snacks offered throughout the flight. As quite a few reviewers have mentioned the food does not stand out like the rest of the service. I found myself leaving the hot breakfast on both flights.

What impresses me about it is that by the time they start boarding you feel that the flight isn't going to depart on time, when in fact it departs slightly early. Onboard service friendly and attentive and food was good, although I have to say it does seem like the quantity has reduced slightly. I've never encountered any issues with Singapore Airlines."

First of all, we were very disappointed with the seat. It may well be the broadest business class seat amongst the airlines but it is very hard to sit on. I felt very uncomfortable after 5 minutes. Singapore Airlines have obviously spent a lot of money installing leather seats but they have seriously overlooked the comfort factor. If you're travelling with a loved one the new 'pods' do not permit easy communication. Secondly, you have to make the seat into a bed yourself. This approach is just not good enough. For example, on Air New Zealand the crew ask you when you'd like to lie down and make your bed up for you. The service was just average. I asked for a 2nd cup of coffee with my breakfast on 2 occasions but this request was ignored. Overall, I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines and did not get my money's worth."

From priority boarding as a business class traveller and getting a pre-flight drink as soon as you get seated is always a good start to your flight. The service provided during meal times was good and had no problems with not having my preferred option. Food and drink overall was great. As for the fold out bed I found it too narrow and not quite long enough. But I still managed a comfortable rest. The bathroom amenities were very good and had exactly what I needed. One thing that leaves me with a good impression is the fact the crew are very willing and clearly enjoy what they are doing. I would recommend.

We then flew Singapore to Doha on Qatar Airways new A350-900 and from Doha to Cape Town on Qatar Airways Boeing 787-800. Seating comfort on their B777-200ER was better than the Boeing 787-800. Food service excellent both ways. Cape Town to Sydney via Singapore was without issues, crew friendly and service impeccable, Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-200ER may be getting old, seats however better than newer aircraft.

The inflight entertainment system includes numerous TV shows, popular movies and is relatively easy to use. Food on this flight was not very tasty but probably only because of the poor catering services in the Hanoi airport. All in all, its a very enjoyable flight."
2015-12-10,9,9,"""a great experience""","Brisbane to London via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I was very impressed by the departure staff in Brisbane - they were very efficient when taking me to the aircraft (I needed a wheelchair) the hostesses saw that I was properly seated etc. The flight was comfortable but I was disappointed with the meals as the beef was very tough. I could not fault the flight from Singapore to LHR - staff very attentive and helpful throughout. My only complaint was that one of the toilets was out of order which meant that long queues were a big problem for one with reduced mobility! Overall, a great experience - thank you."
2015-12-09,9,9,"""continues to satisfy""","Manchester to Tokyo via Singapore. From the check-in to the baggage collection, Singapore Airlines continues to satisfy me. Add to that the delights of their hub airport at Changi, then I believe this is the perfect package. Everyone I dealt with was polite and interested. The food was good (for airline food), and the IFE plentiful."
2015-12-08,9,9,"""comfortable economy seats""","Singapore to Brisbane with Singapore Airlines. Very good, comfortable and relaxing flight. The attention to detail by the attendants was amazing. Great food (for both meals) and the drink service was very good. The most comfortable economy seats with good pitch and soft cushioning. Great entertainment options with KrisWorld."
2015-12-08,5,5,"""disappointing set of experiences""","Perth to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. Having flown SQ fairly regularly over the past 20 years it is interesting to see a decline in economy class, most particularly its lack of crew consistency. SQ used to be my favourite for its crew consistency in service and courtesy. Sadly, I notice it declining every year the past five or so. Check-in at Perth by snobbish and cold DNata staff quite a difference from past experiences. Perth to SIN was not bad on the older 777-200, not completely full so had a spare seat between myself and the window passenger. Legroom was good on these older jets, with an older entertainment system, which I tend not to use that much. The food was fairly dire for economy and portion sizes terribly small compared to the past. Why is the choice always a bland beef or fish (even when labelled the 'Asian' dish)? Singapore is a nation with a rich culinary tradition, but the meals were invariably bland and uninteresting on all four flights. Choosing the Hindu non-veg meals on the return journey to was more a fraction more spice, but again miniscule portions. But worse was the robotic and occasionally sullen crew. Not once on the PER-SIN did I see the inflight supervisor smile the many times he was in economy class. Just haughty and stiff. Upon disembarking, he couldn't even raise a smile for the economy class passengers. Apart from two very junior staff (about 1-2 months on the job, I asked them), who were pleasant and helpful and actually bothered to make eye contact, the rest of the crew I saw in economy were none of that. Mainly robotic, courteous but practically no eye contact and a cold efficiency. TYO-SIN was a dreadful red-eye special at the rear of a packed Boeing 777-300ER. A noisier plane more claustrophobic feeling large jet I have not encountered down the back. It was unpleasant for a nearly 7 hours in darkness. The leg room is just passable. The entertainment system was the only saving grace for those who enjoy it late at night. Food again was ordinary and bland and small portions. Drink service was stingy. I became visibly ill during the flight and whilst crew members saw me using a sick back and using the toilets repeatedly, did not once ask if I needed anything. Mostly the crew sat down at the back around the galleys gossiping in the interval between meal services. They worked fairly hard during service, but there was no warmth for passengers. On both flights, the time taken to clear the meal trays is now long, nearly one and a half hours on both flights. Unconscionable on a past-midnight flight when the majority of passengers generally wish to sleep. For the passenger who remembers their finer years, I will no longer give them preference when considering my options from PER to TYO. A really disappointing set of experiences."
2015-12-08,10,10,"""truly great service""","Flew Singapore Airlines from Manchester-Singapore-Christchurch and then Auckland-Singapore-Manchester in August and the airline was fantastic. Truly great service with nothing too much trouble. Plenty of food and drink provided when needed and the inflight entertainment was good too - though on the Singapore to Christchurch leg we had an older aircraft which didn't have as many films etc. on it. Good comfy seats with decent enough legroom though on the older aircraft the fact that the arm rest didn't fully rise up and ""disappear"" into the gap between the seats was a bit of a pain. But overall a truly great experience and the best airline I have flown."
2015-12-06,8,8,"""excellent level of service""",Singapore to Mumbai on A380. Comfortable overall with an excellent level of service. I've travelled on Business Class a few times on Singapore Airlines. Food wise excellent in choice options. I've used Singapore Airlines 20plus in the last 2 years and I've only had one bad experience in terms of service and twice experienced delays. Taste wise I've had a bad experience once and choice of food option wise I've not been able to select my preferred choice twice both of which was due to me sitting at the back of plane.
2015-12-06,10,10,"""an excellent experience""","Flew Singapore Airlines from Bangalore to Singapore in economy and it was an excellent experience. The service was good and food was really good. Timely arrival and attention to details are something that they are really good it. If there was one area to be picky, that would be the choice of movies in the inflight entertainment. I will fly Singapore Airlines again !"
2015-12-05,5,5,"""cabin crew were first class""","On the positive side the cabin crew were first class. I was one of only 11 other passengers on the top deck so had 3 flight attendants to look after me. The seats looked wide and comfortable. They certainly are wide but after a while sitting down they became as comfortable as a park bench and when converted into a bed you had to lay across. What bugged me was that once breakfast had been served, the cabin lights were switched off. The lights stayed off until about an hour before landing. I was given socks and eye shades but no amenity kit. The food was okay but films and music were limited. I like classical music but once you have listened to the selection 3 times it gets boring."
2015-12-02,10,10,"""staff was outstanding""","Perth to Singapore. Service from ground and cabin staff was outstanding, the aircraft was well presented. The seat configuration of 2x4x2 is better than 3x3x3 on their Boeing 777 fleet. In my opinion, Singapore Airlines is the best airline."
2015-11-26,10,10,"""well trained and thoughtful""","Singapore Airlines is brilliant and their inflight entertainment was very nice - a lot of new movies. Their food is nice but the portion of it could be a little more, but the cabin staff are really well trained and thoughtful - before the plane was actually about to land they gave some candy to my child to consume as they knows that during landing the air pressure is quite nasty and kids might not like, and that's why she gave my child a candy."
2015-11-23,5,5,"""crew were very friendly""","The aircraft was old, but seat was still pretty good. The boxes under seats for entertainment are disturbing and the entertainment system itself was slow and quite limited. Food was pretty good, I got a fish dish served with rice, and the meal overall was good. The main positive thing was the fact that the crew were very friendly, attentive and professional. However the landing at Jakarta was very rough."
2015-11-20,5,5,"""both crews were unfriendly""","My husband and I have been very strong supporters of Singapore Airlines over many years. Because of the crew and food. We travel regularly with stopovers in Singapore for weeks en route to Australia. Had always found the cabin crew the best, that is sadly not the case anymore. San Francisco to Hong Kong via Singapore and both crews were unfriendly - they only smiled and chatted when they were together preparing meals. They seemed badly trained - meal time was a debacle - instead of pushing cart, they seemed to be taking trays here and there. By the time I received my meal, it was cold - they never came and offered extra drinks, tea/coffee. Took ages to clear trays - in fact passengers were returning trays to meal area. When kids cried, there were no crew trying to help in any way - they were hidden most of the time. They found it very hard to smile! Their training seems to have declined - it's not just important enough to look after the business section, people in economy used to be treated well too. The food is as bad as the US airlines and now the crew is behaving like the crew on US airlines. I find it sad that I will have to try and find another airline. My daughter in law flew from Singapore to Geneva and Zurich to Singapore and she struggled with her 11 month old till she complained to the supervisor and then they changed the attitude! Really, is that what we all have to do? Singapore Airlines needs to get back the charm and friendliness it once possessed. I hope when I return to the US I will find a big improvement in crew. If not, sadly, I will not be be traveling on SIA again."
2015-11-15,1,1,"""downgraded to Economy seats""","Downgraded on Honeymoon. Paid for Premium Economy seats as a pleasant surprise for my new wife but forced to take Economy seats. Singapore Airlines say they had to change the aircraft and so the aircraft we were put into had no Premium Economy seats. It seems to me it was easier to put on us another aircraft and apologise rather than find an aircraft with the appropriate class seats. There were others on our flight who were downgraded like us. Given the segment was from Singapore to London - it was coming from their hub. I find it hard to imagine that they didn't know in advance they were doing this and at the very least to offer a refund. Instead we were pulled aside as we were getting on the plane (despite having boarding passes with Premium Economy allocated seats) and offered an upgrade voucher for another flight (from Economy to Premium Economy). We could not use the upgrade voucher as we are not in a position to travel long distance in the next year before it would expire. It would also have meant we would have had to fly from Melbourne to Singapore to use this voucher - and then pay to fly all the way back too! I emailed Singapore Airlines 3 times and did not have a satisfactory response - the offer was that we could use the voucher on any segment (I don't think there are many segments longer than Singapore-London, so that would be a win for them) and $500 in travel vouchers for use in the next year with Singapore Airlines - again not practical for us."
2015-11-14,9,9,"""everything to my satisfaction""","Auckland to Rome via Singapore with Singapore Airlines was my first long distance, overseas flight for some years and I was a little apprehensive. I was soon put at ease by the cabin crew. The meals were excellent, the toilets were spotless and everything to my satisfaction. The seating was little cramped when the person in front put their seat way back and I was unable to focus on the screen, but I coped OK."
2015-11-14,9,9,"""cabin crew so wonderful""","Heathrow to Auckland via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. The best landing ever into Singapore, so smooth. The cabin crew were just so wonderful. During the night they stood in the cabin or walked around with drinks and snacks. Food, again, was perfect. Toilets were kept clean and tidy. As comfortable as could be but nothing beats your own armchair. Unable to comment on in-flight entertainment as I did not use it. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."
2015-11-12,9,9,"""lived up to expectations""","Singapore to Dubai, and overall, Singapore Airlines lived up to expectations. Hot refreshing towels served followed by some drinks and then our meal. Was slightly disappointed with the meal, it looks unappetizing. Also, was slightly disgusted that the cup holder was stained and the stains were easily removed when I scratched it away with the towel. The compartments around my seats were pretty dirty, namely the earphone compartments, cup holder and magazine holder. I believe this does not reflect on all Singapore Airlines aircraft. Service was very good. We had socks and eye-mask for the flight. Toilets were equipped with mouthwash, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and cups to ease washing up in tight space. Cabin crew were polite and presented themselves very well. As a Singaporean, I am very proud of our national airline."
2015-11-11,9,9,"""service was sensitive and quick""","Perth to London via Singapore was our booked trip with Singapore Airlines, but due to delays it ended up being Perth to Zurich via Singapore, and onto London with BA. After a late departure from Perth, the airline had covered our missed connection before we had landed, arranging a buggy to help move my mother about (she walks with a frame), and whistling us through check-in to our flight. The food was superb, and the service was sensitive and quick. The staff were always on hand to assist my mother. There was only one glitch. Because of our missed connection, Singapore Airlines had re-routed us to fly Singapore to Zurich, from where we would have a British Airways connecting flight to London - an airline we did not want to fly on, preferring to pay more for the Singapore experience. Arrival in Zurich was on time at just before 0800. Whilst endeavouring to locate where our next flight left from, Airport staff quickly worked out what had happened, and that we were on their lists as requiring wheelchair access. So we were in the wrong terminal, but the Swiss authorities took good care of us. The transit is easy if you know how. Our onward connection was on British Airways (Zurich to Heathrow) in Business class. The business class seats were so close together and being over 6'4"" tall, we were moved to the front seats. The meal was just sandwiches and drinks, so disappointing for a business class offering. Also, no-one had thought to let us know which terminal we would disembark at. The change was that we arrived at Heathrow T5, and not T2 as expected with SIA. The Heathrow staff were a godsend, finding our luggage (no mean feat) and even trying to track down our rental car, which had already gone to another client due to change of terminal. We felt cheated by this and it reflects poorly on Singapore Airlines to be organising this type of flight substitution."
2015-11-10,4,4,"""trying to get upgrade""","My review is about the poor service in trying to get an upgrade for a segment of my Singapore Airlines flight. I purposely bought an E ticket, paying 50% more to get that class, so that I could get an upgrade, but now that I try to get the upgrade, the website tells me the ticket can't be upgraded, and I cannot get through to a human on the phone. I sent a message through their e-mail system, but only got a confirmation that it will be attended to within 10 days. This is terrible service."
2015-11-09,10,10,"""best flight I have experienced""","Best seat I have had and in flatbed mode slept well. Can make the bed a bit softer by asking for 2 covers. Service is very attentive, best I've experienced. TV selection and size of TV are very good. Food was very good though they failed to achieve the medium-rare aspect of my partner’s waygu beef. The selection of port and dessert wines (if you like sweet) is good. First class lounge in Sydney is more private than the business class lounge, but much smaller. Felt that the options for food and drinks were somewhat limited. Shower facilities are good. This was the best flight I have experienced."
2015-11-08,10,10,"""Thank you very much""","Bali to Amsterdam via Singapore, due to the a volcano, we couldn't leave Bali as planned in November 2015. The staff in Bali and in Singapore did a great job for us. Singapore Airlines organised transport, hotels and meals and importantly, they give us good information. Thank you very much!"
2015-10-24,3,3,"""tired and shabby Boeing 777""",Singapore to Sydney on a pretty tired and shabby Singapore Airlines Boeing 777. Seemed to be few cabin crew and lacking on inflight entertainment options. This felt like it had been flying since the mid 90s. No floor space as there was an IFE box that took up most of the legroom in the footwell area.
2015-10-24,8,8,"""lovely crew""","London to Singapore with Singapore Airlines on an A380. Lovely crew made the kids feel really at home. Food, wine and service all getting on for business class on a European airline. Comfy seats - we called ahead and booked the upstairs economy seats in the 2x4x2 layout, which gives far more storage space in the windows."
2015-10-23,10,10,"""crew are nice and attentive""",Paris to Singapore. The Singapore Airlines crew are nice and attentive. The seats are confortable and there was a wide range of movies to watch. The printed menu and the cocktail on board makes you feel special. It has been a long time since I used real cutlery on economy.
2015-10-22,9,9,"""hours of undisturbed sleep""","Recently had an excellent Singapore Airlines flight from Sydney to Singapore. Having missed my scheduled morning flight Virgin Velocity and SIA were helpful in getting me on at short notice on the next flight. Being quite tall, I was allocated a row of 4 to myself in the back cabin. Flight was very smooth and I managed several hours of undisturbed sleep. Food and drinks also fine compared to Qantas these days. Smooth landing and quick luggage off at Changi, though the plane was fairly empty."
2015-10-21,9,9,"""wifi tops it up for me""","I love the new Singapore Airlines business class seats on this Boeing 777-309ER. SQ325/326 and SQ1/2 which I travelled recently was spacious, designed to make maneourving so easy whilst seated. Comfortable seat, superb and luxurious pillows and blankets. What tops it up for me was the availability of wifi which allow me to work and keep connected."
2015-10-21,6,6,"""service is generally really good""","Sydney to Bangalore via Singapore. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines for the last 10 years, and overall the service is generally really good. But on my most recent flight, I was surprised to see that the service seems to have taken a bit of a downturn. Check in and Boarding at Sydney was uneventful. But once we boarded the plane, I realized that me and my mother were sitting in a window bassinet seat with the third seat being occupied by an elderly woman with a four month old. The baby in the third seat started crying during takeoff, and it was like that for half of the flight. Also, despite the fact that this plane was only a year old, the seats were already a bit weathered which made you squirm a bit to find a comfortable position. But the food and in flight entertainment was excellent. But even though the selection of movies are good, SQ has stopped giving economy class passengers the adjustable headphones and now gives the iPod style ear phones which are bit painful to wear, and because of that, we had our ears blocked even after we touched down in Singapore. The Singapore to Bangalore leg was much more peaceful since we didn't have a baby next to us, the food was still good but the quantity was less, the entertainment system also wasn't as reactive as on the first flight."
2015-10-20,6,6,"""food and beverages disappointing""","Singapore to Tokyo Narita. I'm a Krisflyer gold member and have been spending most of my air travels with this airline, but this time service is a bit disappointing, especially food. While IFE and seats are fantastic as always (and new too!), food and beverages were disappointing. They prepared not enough Japanese menu for breakfast. These day Singapore Airlines seems to be reducing the meal volume. Some flight attendants look like new hires and know little about passenger services."
2015-10-12,10,10,"""crew are very courteous""","Singapore to Brisbane overnight flight with Singapore Airlines was comfortable. Had in-seat power and the Kris world IFE was up to standard, with updated movies. Both the supper and the breakfast were good. Cabin crew are very courteous and friendly as well."
2015-10-11,9,9,"""whole experience great""","Amsterdam to Singapore. I'd have to say the whole experience was great from check-in to service aboard. Check-in was relatively easy as I checked-in online and went straight ahead to internet check-in counter in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. My baggage was more than allowance (32Kg instead of 30Kg) and the ground staff told me that I won't be charged. Service aboard was also excellent, luckily they have upgraded the aircraft to B777-300ER which is not new but offers better inflight entertainment system and seat features. The cabin crew were present and happy to assist passengers during the flight. There were three meals offered on SQ323, however I found that the meal has been reduced since last time I flew with them on the same route. No cake offered but changed to ice cream. In between snacks were available either offered directly by the crew or set in the galley. Selection of cocktail and mocktail are also offered on economy class. Singapore to Jakarta a short flight about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cabin crew were pretty in rush to offer the meals, yet still professional. At this time, the aircraft was slightly older (B777-300A) which has older seats but surprisingly more comfortable than newer seats. In a sum, my flight experience for long haul flights from AMS-SGP-CGK have been positive."
2015-10-11,9,9,"""a 5 star service""","Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. Comfortable seat with ample legroom for economy. The A330 2x4x2 configuration so much better than 3x4x3. Service very good, drinks on take off, brunch, mid-day drinks service, an flight lunch before landing, with regular water / fruit juice runs in-between. Excellent meals for economy class. Overall a 5 star service"
2015-10-11,8,8,"""one of the best airlines""","Singapore Airlines from Kansai to Changi Singapore. The seats were soft enough and there were blankets and pillows provided. There was turbulence and sleeping was difficult, and I gave up and watched the TV shows in the inflight entertainment system. Breakfast was served at about 3am in the morning and there were a few passengers who were annoyed at the prospect of dining in the wee hours. Stewardesses moved along the aisles to provide us with juices and water. Music was sufficient and there were loads of albums in the Entertainment system but there wasn't enough games. However, to those who read this review and might think that Singapore Airlines is not up to standard, I am being critical and to be honest, Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines I have ever flown."
2015-10-09,7,7,"""service friendly and professional""","Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Milan via Singapore. When Economy class is completely full, it's too cramped and uncomfortable. With long waits for food, drinks and the toilets, I found the flights to be very long and tiring. Having said that, I'm sure this applies to most carriers. The food however, was very nice and the extra snacks are a nice touch. Service was friendly and professional and there's a good choice of movies. Planes on all four flights seemed a little aged."
2015-10-07,9,9,"""fantastic service as always""","Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore, fantastic Singapore Airlines service as always. As long as they never change from their punctual flights, friendly FAs' and exciting IFE, I will remain a loyal customer."
2015-10-06,6,6,"""TV is so near to the seat""",I flew Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 from Singapore to London. The new seat for business class on this Boeing 777 is quite uncomfortable in that the TV is so near to the seat and my head. I got headache watching it for too long. The TV position at the side of my face makes its quite hard for me to look at the TV. Malaysia Airlines business class seat seat is 2x2x2 layout but it is easier to view the TV. Qatar Airways seat arrangement is similar to Singapore Airlines layout of 1-2-1 but but it is more comfortable to watch the TV as it well positioned in front of your leg and equip with advance IFE systems. There is no business class travel kit provided by Singapore Airlines and it is a 5 Star airline. There is no such problem on Singapore Airlines A380 but the TV screen is 2 inches smaller.
2015-10-03,3,3,"""Business Class seat very comfortable""","The Singapore Airlines plane was clean, smart and the wide Business Class seat very comfortable. The staff were really cheerful on boarding, pleasant and welcoming. The meal service was all beautifully done, but so slow. There was at least a 20-minute pause between each course. Plus at breakfast they left me alone for ages, because they forgot my meusli. They were nice, but their service rhythm was way off. Worst of all was that seat. I was in 11K, which meant I was bulkhead, with a seat behind me. The guy in it kept moving about kicking his legs out all the time. Because of the seat design, his legs were right by my head, so I had this thump of his twitching legs and feet, which made sleep impossible."
2015-09-30,9,9,"""inflight meals improved""","Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore, and a fantastic flight. The flights departed on time, the cabin crew were polite, and the IFE was up to date with the latest box office movies. I have noticed an improvement in the Singapore Airlines inflight meals, which was a welcome surprise."
2015-09-30,9,9,"""arrived well fed and refreshed""","Sydney to Singapore on A380 original business class seat. Despite some of the reports that standards had declined, I disagree. The cabin was in very good condition and I like these seats - they are actually soft and comfortable. Service was efficient, maybe not overly friendly but still pleasant. I like the leather covering around most of these seats which adds a touch of class. Very good lunch service and a decent refreshment on the way into Singapore. This is the first time I have seen the flip down flatbed and I prefer this configuration because at least the seat has a comforter and is reasonably soft - flew Cathay recently and found the seat too hard to sleep. The angled sleeping is really a non-issue for me. Singapore to London Heathrow on the new business class. This is slightly better but I did not see a major upgrade - looks a bit more modern with a bigger screen. Same flip down configuration that worked about the same. Two decent meals plus snacks on demand meant that I arrived well fed and refreshed. Slight glitch on Krisworld was the only issue. Overall an excellent flight and certainly the best business class product I have experienced recently - no signs of cost cutting or service reductions from what I experienced."
2015-09-30,4,4,"""the seat is comfortable""","I recently flew Singapore Airlines from Milan to Singapore. The ground staff provided excellent service, however the service on board was not to the level of a 5 star airline. The crew seemed in a hurry to get done and rest. The level of attention went below the average airline. The food served (lunch and breakfast) was acceptable but below some airlines. The seat is comfortable and equipped with all you need on-board (usb charger, latest generation entertainment system, etc). On this route they provided an excellent Wi-Fi service at an affordable price. In all, the service onboard did not justify the amount of money spent for the fare."
2015-09-28,9,9,"""a great experience all the way""","A great experience all the way through with Singapore Airlines. Took the 15:30 from Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita on the spacious A380. Aircraft was clean and clean throughout, from boarding to final destination. Bathrooms were kept in a clean state as were the cabin. There are a variety of meals to select from catering to all creeds that included western, eastern, vegetarian, halal, diabetic and kosher. Snacks are available throughout the duration at no cost and include sandwiches, chips, cookies and drinks. The entertainment system had a wide selection of offerings for passengers from all walks of life. The crew was caring and showed concern for the slightest of problems. I would fly this airline again."
2015-09-25,1,1,"""worst customer service experience""","My husband and I flew with Singapore Airlines from Sydney to London via Singapore, with our 9 month old twins and our older son. We purchased an extra ticket for one of our twins to give us extra space. They initially had us all over the flight. Eventually just before boarding they allowed my husband and I to sit together but we lost the extra seat we purchased and they had three babies in a row! This meant it was so cramped none of the babies could sleep and they all ended up screaming for the entire flight (setting each other off), we bought the extra ticket to avoid this scenario. I noted that there were spare bassinets and empty rows elsewhere on the plane so that wasn't the issue. Neither we nor the other parents or surrounding passengers were pleased. Singapore Airlines are trying to do the same thing to us on our upcoming trip on the way home. They are arguing that since one of our infants has a child seat the baby isn't an infant, and can't have a bassinet, therefore since the other twin has a bassinet we can't be seated together. They won't budge, so one parent with have to juggle one baby on their lap somewhere else on the plane, whilst the other parent has the other baby in front of a bassinet. That's apparently more logical to them then just seating us together. So it becomes impossible to sleep, eat or go to the bathroom. We will never fly with Singapore Airlines again. Worst customer service experience ever."
2015-09-19,10,10,"""brilliant service, friendly and polite staff""","This was my first journey with Singapore Airlines and I loved them - brilliant service, friendly and polite staff, comfortable seats in economy (comfortable enough to sleep) and the inflight entertainment was excellent with a wide choice of films including some new brand releases. Announcements were informative (eg. for passengers changing flights in Singapore), and best of all was the food. I think it was the best food I've ever had on an airline, and included plenty of snacks and a bonus tub of ice cream. I would definitely travel with Singapore Airlines again - they were excellent."
2015-09-18,8,8,"""cost cutting is very evident""","Singapore Airlines is still amongst the tops, and will not hesitate to fly again. However, I must admit the cost cutting is very evident, for the quality and quantity of food and beverages. While food quantity is not too bad, it is way less than what it was in the past. In the amenity kit offered in economy, the least they can do is offer a good toothpaste. Lastly, the staff should offer drinks either before the meals or with meals. If one has ordered a special meal, it is served before everyone else. However the drinks are only served when they come with the trolley to serve the general meals, which can be upto 30 minutes later - by which time the meal is either cold or finished. This was not the case in the past."
2015-09-18,8,8,"""highlight was exceptional crew""","Melbourne to Singapore on a Singapore Airlines refitted B777-300. Check in MEL was slow, and airport security and immigration a mess. MEL can take credit for having some of the most rude airport staff. Comfortable seating onboard, Kudos to Singapore Airlines for keeping 3x3x3 economy class seating. IFE not best and of the older generation - not responsive and bad screen quality. The crew were outstanding and hard working. Generous servings of drinks including Singapore Slings. Sadly their food has taken a very bad turn south. Tiny mains and very uninspired. Food nothing in line with the elaborate and glossy menus handed out. Flight left on time but was late into SIN due to strong head wings. Good flight but several areas have slipped. Highlight on this flight was exceptional crew."

Flew A380 lower deck, aisle rear seating, reasonable experience, very smooth flight. Cabin clean and tidy, staff and service good, ground service also good. Onboard entertainment below par, selection reasonable but not up with some, food ordinary to average only, leg space and seating on lower level below average - tight between seats-limited leg/knee room. Having experienced the A380 I now prefer the Boeing 777 or 340. I spoke to friends who have flown upstairs on the A380 and thought it to be better option."

However, their seat and IFE need updating on some aircraft. They risk losing premium traffic with competitors offering more 1-stop services to anywhere worldwide than Singapore Airlines."
2015-09-12,9,9,"""standard of the meals has dropped""","Melbourne to Hanoi via Singapore, and love Singapore Airlines. The flight attendants and customer service, fantastic. All flights on time. The only downside is that I thought the standard of the meals has dropped, certainly not as tasty as on previous times I have flown with Singapore Airlines."
2015-09-12,9,9,"""happy flying with Singapore Airlines""",Hong Kong to Adelaide via Singapore and I was happy flying with Singapore Airlines. Hong Kong airport ground service was quite nice but Singapore Airport was just so so. I thought quantity of meal was decreased a little bit. The personal TV was not fluent as usual but their Krisworld is still very good as they have many choices for you. The crew was very professional to serve passengers. Singapore Airlines is always my first choice.
2015-09-10,9,9,"""an outstanding product they still have""","I haven't flown Singapore Airlines business class for well over 10 years, what an outstanding product they still have. The seat is so wide and comfortable, with everything from the latest technology available nowadays. Service is attentive and classy, and there is the fantastic food. I booked the cook and had a Nyonya dish delivered to me, it was very delicious and completed the nice experience of flying. Wide movie selections, music and game too. If only the big screen was also a touch screen, would have made this a 10/10 perfect flight. Then again, I wasn't complaining, and would not hesitate to fly with them again."
2015-09-10,10,10,"""love the wide Business class seats""","Sydney to London via Singapore return with Singapore Airlines. The flights both ways left on time, and crew were fantastic on all flights - very efficient and attentive. Found the food excellent and plentiful, and the same for wines and Cocktails. I love the wide Business class seats and flat beds for sleeping. This was my second trip to the UK on the A380 and would not hesitate to fly Singapore again."
2015-09-07,7,7,"""nice, pleasant but without personality""","Shanghai to Melbourne via Singapore, we had exit row aisle seats and these were not too bad, but it can be annoying to get your feet and shoulder bumped in this position. However, there is plenty of leg room. The biggest grip we have is the temperature of the section we were in, I am not sure what was wrong but people on the flight to Singapore from PVG coughed the whole time, the air appeared to be very dry and was extremely uncomfortable and the second leg the cabin was like an oven! An astute flight attendant made a call and within minutes the cabin cooled, but it was the same on the legs coming back, just too warm. We tried to get business class but couldn't, so we opted for economy which was otherwise not too bad. The Singapore Airlines service was lovely but the most mechanical I have ever had - nice and pleasant but without any personality. The food was just ok, was expecting a bit more from this airline and also they don't give out bottled water so you have to always ask."
2015-09-06,10,10,"""highly comfortable and fun flight""","I flew Singapore Airlines from Manchester to Munich back again. We wanted to experience the Boeing 777-300ER. Although I had already flown it with Singapore Airlines a number of times, my friend hadn't, so we decided to make a weekend of it in Munich. Singapore Airlines in-flight product and service have always been top-notch, and this trip was no exception. Flight on time, the seats are comfortable with generous leg room, IFE is very modern and the refreshment served on this leg is very generous considering the flight time is only an hour and a half. Even the little touches such as menu cards in Economy and hot towel they give you upon boarding, go a long way in making the travel experience that bit more special. What is also great is that Singapore Airlines was our cheapest option to get to Munich, it was cheaper than Easyjet. In sum, a highly comfortable and fun flight with warm and attentive service."
2015-09-04,10,10,"""crew was quick and efficient""","Sydney to Singapore on the A380, the check-in was smooth and boarding smooth for an A380. Crew greeted passengers with a smile. Cabin crew were efficient, friendly and very helpful. I had injured my finger while adjusting the seat belt buckle and crew was quick to provide me with antiseptic wipe and plaster. They were happy to share a word or two when asked. Next flight, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, the boarding was quick and crew efficient and greeted with a smile, appreciative when I asked how they are. Although it was a short flight, crew was quick and efficient in giving out drinks and to attend to any assistance - truly outstanding service."
2015-08-30,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"You can't go wrong flying with Singapore Airlines. They have never disappointed me even though I fly in economy class. A slight delay out of the second leg flight out of Tokyo Narita, but the rest of the flight is smooth. Crew were excellent during both legs of the flight. They checked on passengers during the middle of flight, bringing water to passengers who were awake. Will definitely fly with them in the future."
2015-08-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Recently flew SIN-CHC and AKL-SIN with SQ. They did not disappoint, although their drive for perfection seems to have the downside of making the whole experience a lot less personal. I would never have noticed this however, had it not been for the connecting flights on SWISS, where the personal approachability of the crew made all the difference. One point to note: The Child-Meal option is a grand array of a variety of children's favourites. Which certainly helps with a picky child."
2015-08-28,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Short midweek trip to BKK. No complaints about this regional business class service, but a little pricey compared to Thai Airways. However, Singapore Airlines have a more modern regional fleet than Thai Airways, and the flight times suited my schedule better. I did note an upgrade to the food offerings in the lounge at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, which made a pleasant difference. Used the Bangkok airport express train service for first time, as little bags to carry. That's recommended."
2015-08-25,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Have flown Singapore Airlines multiple times and is probably one of the best airlines I have flown so far in terms of quality and service. I decided to travel on their new premium economy flight. The first leg Sydney to Singapore a A380 premium economy and the next leg on a Silk Air Boeing 737-800 which I won't be reviewing here. There is a separate line for boarding premium economy which is good. The seats were 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on economy. There are altogether around 6 or 7 rows with a maximum of 48 or 56 in the section. The seats are wider with more leg room and a retractable thigh rest. I did not use this feature much. It has got a bigger seat which is more comfortable. It is not a flat bed similar to business class. The food was good and I know you can order certain special chef prepared meals before boarding on the website. Champagne is available along with wine etc. The entertainment system is a larger screen which I think is either 11 or 13 inch and there are noise cancelling larger headphones available as standard. Overall it was a good experience and would not mind travelling on it again.
2015-08-23,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Lounge in Brisbane had been ""refreshed"" since my last visit and looked more pleasant. Had booked a centre seat on 777 as travelling alone and had checked in on line but reallocated to an aisle next to another passenger at the window. It is difficult for a fellow passenger to get to the aisle without disturbing you if you are asleep. Cabin was full so could not move. My personal preference if for a herringbone layout when traveling alone. Crew on the leg Brisbane to Singapore were somewhat helpful and friendly, less so on the leg to Delhi but both were OK. I asked for a water on board when in the air after having left Brisbane but was told by the crew member that they were going to a ""briefing"" and I would need to wait. It arrived 20 minutes later. Sleeping on both legs was a bit challenging given that the beds are not flat and you do get used to them being so on other carriers. On the 777 the passenger beside me woke me twice trying to get to the bathroom. Asking for help with the A380 bed was met an explanation of how to do and that it was easy rather that actual help and I had to go back to ask again. Entertainment OK but had to rewind to get to the start of the movie and it ""dropped out"" twice on the 777. Sadly, food was not great, my special meal is almost always the same on SG and was overcooked this time. Coffee was good. Wine selection looked good and had a Tattinger and a Chablis with both being very enjoyable. No bubbly offered pre take off on either flight. A380 cabin a bit scuffed around my seat but otherwise interiors were fine. On time arrival and departures. On balance this was my choice to India as Qantas/ Emirates were via Dubai or on a 737 on Jet Airways via Singapore or Air India via Sydney. SG thus offer a good connection and better service than Air India but the flights were not anything special."
2015-08-23,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Chennai has no Business Class line through security so it was a long process, the benefit of this being that once you see the Air India Maharajah Lounge that you don't have long for the flight. The lounge is the poorest I have seen, looked more tired than those of Air Cubana in Cuba. Furniture was in disrepair, there was a bar that didn't appear to have been used for some time, sitting next to a disconnected fridge, no alcohol, food that looked inedible and was hardly warm and stained bulky furniture in the main room (this was full). Boarding was fast and efficient, the first leg meal was a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and carrot with no dressing, butter but no bread and chopped chicken in tomato sauce that was dry and uninspiring. The dessert was melon and was the only thing I ate and went to sleep. The Brisbane sector was better in terms of food but still not great and the first meal I was served I have had four times this year (turkey breast which if you order GF you can also get for breakfast) but the crew on both flights was friendly and responsive. The Brisbane crew in particular was excellent and provided personalised service by name. Slight delay on the tarmac at Changi due to air conditioning warning light that was being checked by the pilot but arrived on time. Bags out within minutes as we were the only flight there. If it wasn't for the crew I couldn't recommend SG this time."
2015-08-19,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Wonderful service, hot towel and welcome drink for every passenger. In flight system is ok, new movie and TV series. Food is good, I had three choices of main course. Cabin crews were attentive and good attitude. But it's not cheap, Melbourne to London round trip cost me AU$2600, other airlines such as Thai Airways only AU$2000. The service was worth the price. Wi-Fi is available, but very expensive."
2015-08-18,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flying SQ Suites is pure luxury in the sky. This was a newer A380, for the leather seats were the revamped ones, with beautiful detailed stitching. I love the SQ suite for it’s very spacious, much more than the Emirates one. And when converted to a bed, the mattress they provided was very comfortable. This time I didn’t order Book the Cook as I ran out of time, so I let myself be surprised by the onboard menu. Had the 4 course chef special that was excellent. The service on SQ is all about Asian hospitality. It’s all about you, which when done properly, like SQ does it, makes you feel like royalty."
2015-08-15,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,"First time on Singapore Airlines. Lounge in Sydney very basic. Apparently a renovation is in progress. Seat uncomfortable in comparison to others, staff did their job but without enthusiasm . Food good. Wine selection very average. Toilet at front of aircraft fantastic in size. Disappointing compared to reputation."
2015-08-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"ADL-AMS (via SIN) return. Overall, cannot fault Singapore Airlines. The flights, crews, service and quality of food and beverages were excellent. Have flown SIA many times and to be honest are yet to have a bad experience - even in economy. The crew on SQ279 on Sunday 9 August 2015 were warm, friendly and welcoming."
2015-08-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Comfy, friendly, tasty food, no delays - even landed 20 mins early into Perth. I wish the IFE had more movies and games for children. Flight cost around £200 less than other airlines. Nice to be able to use WIFI, my mates were impressed to see me update on facebook."
2015-08-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"A most enjoyable and comfortable flight with Singapore Airlines. On time departure, ample legroom, food very good, service excellent and IFE perfect. Singapore Airlines continues to be my preferred international airline - they are truly are a 5 star airline."
2015-08-04,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,"After 10-15 years of flying Singapore, I think I'll finally stop now. Over the last 2-3 years the service quality has become dire. Plane age and upkeep seems to be getting worse, with cabins uncared for. My biggest ire is the decrease in service for economy, or overworking the premium seats. Both in London, Singapore, and Auckland I've seen that they now have 3-4 check in desks for business, with no customers, yet only 1 for economy, with an hour long queue. The last flight (SIN-ATH), an argument broke out between staff and customers while boarding, as the staff tried to push past boarding economy customers to serve juice to the business passengers. I may not pay quadruple price to sit in business, but I am still a paying customer. Sorry Singapore, you've tried to compete with the UAE for business passengers, and alienated the rest in the meantime."
2015-07-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Singapore Airlines is one of the best airlines i've ever flown, for me it's the best airline in Asia but why? 1. service on board is perfect 2. crew is friendly 3. food is very good for ECO 4. IFE has much to offer for everybody and is up to date with regards cinema films 5. groundstaff knows how to board the plane efficient and fast!"
2015-07-25,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flying Silk Air to Singapore and connecting from there to Adelaide. All went well, good food, friendly staff, but was hoping for a refurbished plane - nevertheless, for Economy Singapore Airlines is very comfortable."
2015-07-20,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"SQ978 from Singapore to Bangkok. Flight arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule on 13 June 2015, flight attendant was polite and friendly. I ordered the seafood meal and it was delicious. On 19 June 2015 on the way back from Bangkok seafood meal was good and very tasty. It was my fathers birthday and the cabin crew helped to it a special flight and to surprise my dad. In-flight entertainment offered lots of movies. The cabin crew on SQ978 offered top ups of my tomato juice without me having to ask. Economy seat is clean and new."
2015-07-15,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Singapore Airlines is a wonderful long-haul airline to fly. The legroom and footrest are great, the food was excellent and the menu was very nice. The service and the entertainment was excellent. Music, movies, shows and games on the screen. Yet there is a smaller selection than on many other airlines."
2015-07-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Once again great service. The 2 hour delay prior to take off was a long wait, but the captain apologised continuously and instructed the crew to continuously pour drinks, even the inflight entertainment system was on throughout. Flight was smooth, captain occasionally made an announcement to update passengers on the flight status. Turbulence was predicted before hand which gave both the crew and passengers ample time to return to their seats"
2015-07-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Once again, SQ went above and beyond in delivering the highest standard of service a customer can expect. Upon boarding and realising the aircraft is only half-filled, the crew offered my family and I each a row so that we would have a more comfortable flight. Before take off, the crew even engaged in small talk with the passengers, informing us of what we can expect upon arriving in Maldives and some of the activities we could join. During the flight, the crew walks frequently to check on passengers but are never intrusive. Drinks were served throughout the flight (without passengers asking for them). Furthermore, honeymoon cakes were given for couples visiting the Maldives for their honeymoon."
2015-07-09,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Singapore Airlines proved to be a true 5-Star airline. The crew was consistently accommodating, polite, patient and kind. The food was outstanding - just as good as what one might expect in a decent restaurant! While their ticket prices aren't always the most competitive, the few extra dollars make the flight experience a truly enjoyable one."
2015-07-09,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,"A rather worn cabin interior, seats reasonably comfortable, but cannot be compared to the new upgraded Singapore Airlines business class product. Service was efficient, but rather impersonal by a tired looking crew. Food was dreadful. Overall a rather average experience. I am having another couple of long haul flights coming up - I hope they are back to the usual SQ business class standard."
2015-07-07,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,"As a business class traveller, I find an arrogant and unhelpful attitude among staff, especially in airports, and mediocre inflight service. Business class seating, even the new form, is well below the quality of other airlines I use. Lounge access is also handled very unsympathetically for Gold Star Alliance travellers, if you are not a KrisFlyer member."
2015-07-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"SUB-SIN, SQ931, 28 June. A330-300 on both legs. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very polite crew members. The aircraft's In-flight entertainment was updated compared to last flight's movie. The seat on A330 was very comfortable with quite a lot of space. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines."
2015-06-30,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"A memorable experience on A380-800 with Singapore Airlines. SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on. In general, considering the high level of service quality offered, this flight had a good value for money."
2015-06-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"My first time flying Singapore Airlines and impressed with attention to detail and politeness. Even though it was only a 2-hour flight, everything was flawless. The food was warm and tasty, seats were comfortable with ample leg room."
2015-06-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,All legs without problems apart from a overly warm cabin on last sector which was soon fixed. Seats not too uncomfortable and seat pitch okay. Thankfully no one in front of me reclined. IFE is as good as ever. food good. plenty of drink runs. Check in and cabin staff performed as expected. One of the best airlines.
2015-06-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Lufthansa Senator lounge in Frankfurt good. The cabin was very clean and excellent staff and service. Catering out of FRA can be iffy at times but was spot on for this flight. IFE good with plenty of choices. Amenity kit is ok. I think that SQ is as close to perfect as is possible. Have tried many others but not found them up to Singapore Airlines standard.
2015-06-27,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,"The experience today at Shanghai Airport was a debacle. The flight was delayed 2hrs and 20 mins. This meant our connecting flight would be missed. What started out as a long 2 leg trip, slowly got longer. I then discovered that the boarding had moved gates. No announcement. I discovered it by chance walking past the departure board. Boarding was a joke. People were pushing in, the staff had no control or idea. The new gate was a transfer by bus. Followed by a 50m walk in the rain and up the stairs. The airconditioner on the plane did not work on boarding, we sat for over 30 mins sweating. When it finally took off, it was 4 hrs 20 mins late. This put us in Singapore at 1.45am with a 6 hours wait for the next flight. When we landed, they offered a hotel, 30 mins taxi ride there and 30 mins back. We said no and had to negotiate access to their lounge."
2015-06-23,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"My first experience with Singapore Airlines was wonderful, and nice economy class seats. The cabin crew served customers with a smile. The food could be better, the chicken rice was tasteless but Singapore Airlines do offer ice-cream at the end of the meal."
2015-06-23,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"San Francisco to Hong Kong Economy Class. The seat leg room is good and there is a foot rest. Inflight entertainment system is also wonderful. The food was high quality for Economy Class, and the service is great, flight attendants are friendly and helpful."
2015-06-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Manila to Paris via Singapore return. The A330s on MNL-SIN-MNL are new, with comfortable seats and a little more legroom, compared to A380s on SIN-CDG-SIN. In the A380s, seats are cramped. Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They ""manage"" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let's them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices. Overall flight experience was average."
2015-06-19,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"After more than 4 years since I've flown with SQ, I continue to be impressed with their high level of service and quality. Despite the aircrafts being one of their older ones in their fleet, it was well maintained and IFE worked perfectly. Their ground service was also really good - I was 10kg over my check-in baggage limit but SQ was kind enough to waiver 5kg of that so I only had to pay the excess for 5kg. Already looking forward to my next trip with them."
2015-06-19,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"A very high class airline. We didn't expect to receive a meal (MNL to SIN) but they have it and also the entertainment is available. We didn't wait for a long time in Singapore to proceed on our next flight going to FRA. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music, games. They serve delicious meals and always asking passenger if they need something. The only thing I don't like is that the seat pillow are too high for petite people like me."
2015-06-18,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flew SIN - JNB on business, and in business class on SQ. Service to their usual high standard. Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection. This isn't really good enough these days and SQ need to upgrade their fleet in that respect PDQ!"
2015-06-17,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Always nice to fly with Singapore Airlines. Again had great flights, enough legroom. Entertaiment was sufficient. Very friendly crew. Will fly with them again. Seat number 43A and C."
2015-06-12,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flying on SQ business from DXB-CAN via SIN has been one of the best flights I've taken. The seat turned down into a full flat bed, great food and amazing service. I actually wanted the flight to go on for a few more hours it was that nice!"
2015-06-07,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,MAN-MUC in May B777-300ER economy class. Check in and cabin crew very friendly. Punctual. B777 interior a little dated and probably due for a refurbishment. Food basic but as you would expect on a short leg. Nothing exceptional that would distinguish from flying another airline. I had a small ground services issue that the airline was unwilling to resolve on that basis I could not recommend.
2015-06-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,May 30: Singapore-Malé Maldives / June 1: Malé Maldives-Singapore. Excellent service on both legs: attentive warm discreet. Warm towel service and menu cards in Economy. Seats were plush and comfortable with footrest head rest lumbar support and ample legroom. Food was warm (presentation could've been better). Aircraft (777-200ER) showed its age but it was spotlessly clean. As I recently relocated to Singapore from the U.S. I look forward to flying SQ as often as possible.
2015-06-04,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN 12 May and return on SQ12 19 May. Was my first time flying the A380 despite a few bumps of turbulence near NRT I found it to be an amazingly quiet aircraft. Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6). I would definitely recommend SQ to friends and family; I'm really looking forward to trying out their premium economy service when it rolls out maybe one day the suites!
2015-06-04,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,After travelling from London to Brisbane and back last month flying Singapore Airlines I must say I would recommend this airline and enjoyed my flights. All the staff had a very high standard of customer service. I hope to travel more in future with Singapore airlines.
2015-05-31,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-SUB SQ930 26 May. A330-300 on both legs. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. The aircraft's PTV was good the movie was updated. The seat on A330 was nice and better for other full service airlines operates this aircraft. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
2015-05-31,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-CHC overnight flight in economy. Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE. Poor choice especially audio. I like to settle down and doze while listening to some relaxing guys. I gave up on both audio and video as the headphones were useless and the white noise too much to hear anything. Improvement required!
2015-05-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-SYD return. Outbound LHR-SIN was a 777-300ER newly fitted out and very comfortable. First class crew addressed by name throughout and constant top ups of drinks. Book the cook option of monkfish as very nice! SIN-SYD was an a380 same excellent service as the first leg although the veal option was a little disappointing. Return SYD-SIN was on an ancient 777-200ER seat really showing it's age and an antiquated IFE. However the crew made up for this with their usual excellent service and the food was excellent. SIN-LHR on an a380 with all business class top deck. slightly indifferent service on this leg but still pretty good in terms of industry overall. Would definitely recommend although watch out for the old equipment used on some journeys.
2015-05-28,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew SIN-DXB-SIN first time in Singapore Airlines business class. Service was poor on the outbound leg. Planes are quite old. Middle East Airlines business class much better Emirates Etihad Qatar Airways. Wine glasses very small. General impression was not as good as I had expected of SQ.
2015-05-28,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,Traveled 4 segments. HKG-SIN-SYD and return on a 772ER 773ER A388 and A333. Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.
2015-05-27,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,We travelled on April 26th Brisbane Australia to Singapore then onto Paris. Came back Munich to Singapore Singapore to Brisbane. The trip Brisbane to Singapore very comfortable and the staff were fantastic. The other legs of the journey were OK comfort but found the staff less attentive.
2015-05-22,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,CPH-SIN-DPS-SIN-CPH outbound on 15th of May and return May 21 (four segments). Must say that I am very disappointed at their service performance. Having flown many times on SQ I did not expect almost rude service from some of the cabin crew attendants. This is not the 5 star SQ that I am use to. CPH-SIN was an old refitted 777-200ER with an entertainment system from stone age. The food was quite tasty tough. Next time I fly to South East Asia I will definitely choose other options like Qatar Airways or Thai. Much better value for money.
2015-05-20,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled on SQ211 on 16 May 2015 Singapore to Sydney in Economy seat 32G. Flight was full mainly connecting passengers coming in from India. Our second (light) meal was served very late almost at the time when the pilot made the announcement for cabin crew to prepare flight for arrival and some passengers including myself were still waiting to be served! It was rather stressful to rush through my meal knowing the plane was arriving soon. Apparently the reason why the second meal was served so late was due to the high volume of special meal requests from the Indian passengers. I am a Kris Flyer Frequent traveller and travel often on the Singapore to Sydney leg and have experienced/observed this problem before where the meals are served later than usual because cabin crew are serving a high volume of special meal requests. Perhaps SIA need to review the management of special meals on future flights where there are many passengers travelling from India to Sydney via Singapore. It will be interesting to ask SIA how they will manage if 90% of the passengers have special meal requests on one flight! So this was quite a let down in service for me. I also have a suspicion that the in flight meals served have become smaller and lighter in portions. Another problem was my seat TV did not have Entertainment on demand! It was most disappointing especially when I was informed while most of the other passengers had Entertainment on demand programs mine was one of the few that did not have it! Surely this type of problem should be noted by cabin crew at the end of its last flight for service maintenance. I think SIA needs to pull up its socks to maintain its renowned high standards!
2015-05-20,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ328 SIN-MUC 15th May. Full flight departed and arrived on time. Service was efficient although dinner service was interrupted by turbulence but resumed shortly afterwards. Seat was comfortable and IFE worked as advertised. Plane was an older 773ER and would benefit from a refurb. Otherwise a great flight and would fly them again.
2015-05-20,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN economy 12 May 15. Airplane was very comfortable with flat seats extremely comfortable to lay down (as it was half empty most of people had a row of seats for himself). Inflight entertainment had a large variety of movies of any genre. Food was good and generally abundant. The only two drawbacks were the delay it had departing from Heathrow (more than 1 hour) and the possibility to have dinner with reclined seats meaning that I had little space for my dinner as the child in front of me decided to do so. I would still classify a 5 star experience.
2015-05-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,It's decadent luxury to fly the SQ A380 Suites from Singapore to New York. Of course I'm tempted to compare them to the Emirates suites and I have to say that overall this is a much more luxurious spacious and comfortable product than Emirates. Minus the shower which I do miss on such a long journey. The suite is on the lower deck which is wider and the sides don't curve in as they do on the upper deck so the suite is very spacious. The leather seat is extremely comfortable and plush and when they convert the suite into a bed which is separate from the seat it's the best bed in the air that I've slept in. All this can be done because the SQ suite is modular where parts move up and down as they convert it from sitting room to bed room. The food and service was excellent as is customary on SQ. I sat in row 3 which is the only row with 3 windows. I like to look out and have as much light as I can so this is important to me. Although I still don't like the A380 windows for they are recessed and make you feel like you're in a submarine!
2015-05-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,MUC-SIN 777-300ER 5/5/15. Older plane was a bit rough around the edges but it might be one of the ones due for a refit. Flight left on time and arrived on time. Flew economy and had a whole row to myself that said there was still more than enough space if the row was full. Service was attentive with staff coming through often with drinks. All meal option available but it was a half empty plane so was not expecting problems the quality is first rate as always as was the entertainment system.
2015-05-13,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Brisbane to Bangkok return. All flights on time. All full. I haven't flown SA for 12 months now and I feel the service on board is slipping. Only three flight attendants to serve a full flight in the back section. No drinks except tea or coffee offered at meal times. I asked for a soft drink and got given a half a plastic cup. Serving a big chunk of chicken on a plane when crowded is virtually impossible to cut. I had to leave it. Breakfast hasn't changed in 10 years. Still the same old cold bread roll and cake. Planes seem old and dirty. My bag didn't make my Bangkok flight and was sent on the next one. Why this happened I do not know.
2015-05-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Jan 30 2015 SQ 517. From check in at Calcutta Airport staff were very professional and also assisted with your questions and as well as the immigration forms for your visit to Singapore. Once on board you experience Singapore Hospitality from the snack and drink service to meal service and also duty free service. The meal was hot and delicious. Wonderful staff seats and PTV. Staff professional and friendly to talk to these days you never get menus on the plane of the choices of what you have for breakfast lunch dinner as well as drinks wines beers etc. I will travel again with Singapore Airlines again.
2015-05-10,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Travelled LHR-PER via SIN January 2015. Flight from London was on a brand new A380 really comfortable great IFE good food good food friendly and attentive crew. Couldn't fault anything. Flight from Singapore was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft then they were cleaning and then it was announced there was a problem with the aircraft and they had to get a replacement. After a 2 hour delay we finally get to the gate my partner who is 6' 7"" and has had DVT asked about extra legroom seats (of which none had been available at the time of booking). After checking the system they said they had no leg room seats left and he should have purchased at the time of booking but as I said this wasn't available. After boarding the flight and finding our seats we see that 4 of the extra legroom seats have children in them with feet that don't even touch the floor. Safe to say my partner was fuming as he wedged himself into his seat. The flight from SIN-PER was on an old plane and the IFE wasn't great. The screens were bad quality but that was probably due to age of the plane. The crew were really attentive and brought hot towels and drinks throughout the flight. Overall Singapore are great with friendly and attentive staff. However they shouldn't sell extra legroom seats to children."
2015-05-10,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,I travelled business class SQ218 from Melbourne to Cebu flight was great and comfortable. Had the new pod seats. Upon my return travelling home to Melbourne SQ237 was disappointing. The Business seats were tiny old and seat was at a very uncomfortable angle. A couple of hours into the flight my back was aching. I've flown a few times business class with this airline but this would have been the worst I have experienced. I think it's time the old planes are upgraded and the seats are refurbished. For the money we pay I think all passengers deserve a comfortable trip.
2015-05-10,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,KIX-SIN-KIX. A333 in both cases. Star AllianceGold check-in perfect in KIX but rather cold no smiles in SIN. Sakura lounge in KIX (poor) so we went to ANA lounge much better. Excellent lounge in SIN. Very comfortable seats on both flights. Better on first leg (row 48 with extra cost exit row extra leg space). Food and drinks at a very nice standard. Service perfect full of smiles. IFE failing on both legs as for many other pax. A serious issue. Luggage quickly delivered. SQ is without any doubt an excellent airline for Economy class.
2015-05-08,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Melbourne-Shanghai (and return) via Singapore. Excellent service as always. I much prefer SA to any of the Chinese airlines to fly to China despite needing to transfer and costing more. The service quality more than makes up for it. Travelling with a young child we were given priority boarding priority meals extra little snacks and drinks etc.. and generally going out of their way to engage and be friendly to our son. Super polite friendly and helpful staff at all times. Plenty of food drinks and snacks and virtually every meal has a ""Chinese"" and ""Western"" choice. Economy class food and seating is very good for that class. Inflight entertainment is expansive with a huge selection of movies music games kids activities educational tools and flight information. Highly recommended."
2015-05-04,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Copenhagen - Singapore SQ 351. Singapore - Manila SQ 910. Manila - Singapore SQ 921. Singapore - Copenhagen SQ352. 19-30th April. My flight went perfectly absolutely nothing to complain about. Food and staff service is very good.
2015-05-02,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 231 Singapore to Sydney 28 April 2015. The latest iteration of this airline's in-flight entertainment system features a new touch screen and other refinements but appears to have dropped an important feature of its predecessor. Everything is now shown in wide screen ratio (16:9) and there is no adjustment - at least none that I could find - for standard screen ratio (4:3) so that older movies and TV shows are horizontally distorted and unwatchable. This was easily available on the previous system. As a frequent flyer on this airline this limits my options.
2015-05-01,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-PEN return. Flight from Heathrow to Singapore was the usual experience. Staff very helpful and friendly food good for airline food. Inflight entertainment is very good lots of choice. Good snacks available between meals. The A380 we flew on was looking a little tired a few marks and scratches on the seats. Flight from Singapore to Penang was with silk air. First time with them and very happy with the service.
2015-05-01,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,20 Mar 2015 SQ391. 22 Mar 2015 SQ217. 5 Apr 2015 SQ208. 6 Apr 2015 SQ392. Ground service was inflexible and unable to organise a meaningful seat plan for a group of ten. Aircrafts are pretty old and catering is ordinary. Space between some seats were very unacceptably narrow for an 8 hour flight. Timing and flight experience are good though.
2015-04-30,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ11 NRT to SIN. Airbus A380-800. Although it's getting older and older (PTV not touch screen while some other airlines already have one) service is great as usual. Attentive cabin attendants. They even know how to deal with small kids so they don't meddle with other passengers. Food was great except dessert. They used to give out H-Dazs Ice creams for this route but not lately maybe cost cut measure I suspect. All in all a pleasant flight.
2015-04-30,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ-318 SIN-LHR. Brand new B777-300ER new cabin in all classes including economy. Touch screen IFE Krisworld was amazing. Due dietary reasons I opted for fruit platters for both meals and they were great. Nice snacks between meals. Friendly cabin crew clean cabin.
2015-04-28,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"FCO-SIN-CHC on March 29 and CHC-SIN-FCO on April 13. It's a long trip from FCO to CHC but flying SQ makes it more bearable. I used to fly Emirates but the service is terrible compared to SQ and EK use the 3-4-3 configuration on the 777 while SQ still uses 3-3-3. It makes a lot of difference. I am 1.83m tall and there is plenty of legroom on SQ flights. Service and meals were good on all my sectors. Cabin crew were uniformly pleasant and welcoming. Drinks and snacks in between meals were served frequently even during the so-called ""middle of the night flights."" I fly Economy class so I don't expect too much - with SQ however I get a good experience and excellent value for my money."
2015-04-27,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,DEN-SIN April 2014. A330 was nice and clean. Comfortable seat and good food. Only complaint is staff tossed out the meals as soon as the plane had levelled off and seemed in a rush but didn't follow it up with much service. I expected at least a drink service (business class after all) and there was nothing you would have had to hit the call button to get service. Will know next time to request items from Singapore staff and not wait for service.
2015-04-27,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,LAX-NRT on 4/4/15 and NRT-LAX on 4/22/15 A380. Based on a limited sample of two flights we can say the hard product is outstanding the service is good to excellent depending on the crew and the food is nowhere near the best of international first class. The seats are very comfortable and the beds are terrific. Both my wife and I had a very good nights sleep. The suite is quiet with only the gentle hum of the 380's engines. The outbound cabin crew were efficient warm and eager to be helpful. The inbound cabin crew was good but certainly not exceptional. They did their job well but that was it. Food was the big disappointment. Limited selections (unless pre-ordered) and ranged from ok (lobster thermidore and beef short ribs to poor (vastly overcooked steak). Caviar service good but not the best in the air. Wines were excellent. All in all very good but still disappointing.
2015-04-27,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-CPH April 2014 777 was in good condition. Nice layout in business class. Beds were good I am tall and just fit the bed system which isn't always the case. Service was good and food was decent. Nice lounge in SIN.
2015-04-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Manchester England to Sydney Australia via Singapore. And having flown from Sydney to Manchester and Manchester to Sydney many times only ever using Emirates and Qantas I found a cheap deal with Singapore airlines and thought I'd give them ago. Now being from England Emirates are one of the most advertised and so I thought was the best airline. How I have been very wrong. In economy the seat sizes seem pretty much the same but with Singapore I found the seat cushions were a lot softer. The major difference I found with Singapore was the service. They were always smiling and welcoming. And this being a night flight they didn't sit down for four hours for next meal time they circled with drinks and snacks in between more than once!
2015-04-19,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-SGN-SIN on B777-200 and A330-300 with vastly different experience. I have been a very loyal customer to Singapore Airlines but I have to say that please phase out the B777-200 series. The aircraft is obviously old and weary as compared to A330-300 series which is very new and more comfortable. The rest is just average but understandable given it is a short haul flight and I am not very particular about food and cabin crew help. Singapore Airlines still wins me whenever I want to book an air ticket.
2015-04-19,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew Singapore Airlines for the first time ever last August. Since then I have flown another 2 times to Shanghai return from Brisbane. I can not fault them. The food service and seats are great. The planes between Brisbane and Shanghai are always full but the service is never lacking. The A380 between Shanghai and Singapore is great as well when I select the exit row upstairs. I will never fly another airline to China again.
2015-04-12,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew business class from Singapore to Delhi two days ago and the service was extremely poor and shoddy. We were flying in from Brisbane by Singapore Airlines and took the flight to Delhi after a stop over at Changi airport. So I was in a position to compare the service on two flights of the same airlines. While on the flight from Brisbane the service was good on the flight to Delhi the hostess was pretty bad in her interpersonal conduct very poor communication skills overbearing almost irritating. On a late night flight a little courtesy helps a traveller relax but it was surely lacking. Pretty disappointed after all the slick advertising the real experience was shockingly bad. Money badly spent.
2015-04-10,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I have flown SIA for years in and out of Asia. Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well. Surely SIA can provide the best headpieces to go with its 'image'.
2015-04-04,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,We flew From London to Auckland via Singapore. on an Airbus 380. The review is based on all 4 flights as there was little to choose between them. The service was consistency high; attentive friendly and helpful The best I have flown and I am a regular traveller. The only disappointment for me was that the Book the cook meals were somewhat disappointing. I would have been better off with the standard meals. My wife found the beds hard and difficult to lie diagonally but they were fine for me. I would choose Singapore every time if I could.
2015-04-01,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-AKL on A380. We paid extra for exit row seats on upper deck money well spent. They are doubles with massive space in front. These flights were the most relaxing long haul we have taken. IFE and service excellent.
2015-04-01,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,Less than impressed. Rather tired looking 777 to Singapore. TV kept changing between colour and black and white. Seemed understaffed for the number of passengers on board. Return flight on an A380 - no sound at my seat. Again seemed understaffed for a full plane. Trying to change flight date even with changeable ticket was painful.
2015-03-28,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,"We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore."
2015-03-25,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew MEL to SIN using a 777-200. Ever since SQ removed the A380 from Australian flights their value for money is no longer there. The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight the IFE was not working the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for. Even Vietnam Airlines now will be flying the A350 and the B787-900 to Melbourne soon. I'm really disappointed.
2015-03-20,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,We were making a return trip from Kota Kinabalu through to London Heathrow via Singapore on 28th February 2015. We checked in at KK in plenty of time we were the first people to check-in! We were issued with our tickets but not told that we would not be able to sit together on the 13 hour flight from Singapore to London we discovered that by checking our tickets before entering departure. We returned to the check in desk and were told that they were unable to change this as it had been 'blocked' (We feel that we should have been told this when we checked in). We were advised to talk to the transit desk when we arrived in Singapore. On arrival we went to the transit desk the staff were very helpful but we were told that we were still unable to sit together. We had explained that my husband was a very nervous flier. When we got to the departure gate they were able to change our seats. Why could this not have been done earlier and alleviated a lot of stress for us. The breakfast meal was not very nice. Initially we were told there was only one choice which was Singapore carrot cake which we didn't want as did most people sitting near us. We were found an alternative meal which was cold! We are regular fliers to Asia and have flown with Singapore airlines many times but we feel that on this occasion the standard of service was not to the standard that we would expect from a premier airline.
2015-03-20,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 917 (Manila to Singapore) and SQ 918 (Singapore to Manila). March 9 2015 (SQ 917) and March 11 2015 (SQ 918). Singapore Airline's service is more impressive than the last airline I took before. I got this flight 50% off from its original price from a promo so when they go on sale Singapore Airlines is more than value for your money. Even if they aren't on sale they are reasonably priced with the service and freebies they give. They have free- flowing drinks their food is impressively close to a fine dining experience and their staff is very friendly and approachable. Their inflight entertainment is good but the seat's legroom is a bit cramped.
2015-03-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-SUB and SUB-SIN SQ930/931. A330-300 on both legs. Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members and at all times kept toilets clean. The aircraft's PTV was good. The seat on A330 was nice can stretch longer than some full services airline in Asia and it's comfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
2015-03-20,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from AKL to SIN on January 13. The plane was an Airbus A380. The service was nice and the food delicious. The only problem was the inflight entertainment system the music and the movies would stop now and then for the entire flight even though there was no announcements. Despite that this is a very pleasant flight and I would definitely fly using this airline again.
2015-03-17,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-CHC and return. Outstanding service food drinks and comfort in business class. Staff excellent attention and politeness with high level of customer care training. Altogether a fantastic experience.
2015-03-17,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew on redemption tickets SQ First Singapore to Seoul and Business back from Seoul. I was very disappointed with the first class. The last time I did First was to New York about 4+ years ago on the ageing 747 that was far better an experience. Pre-flight details were excellent using the Private Dining in T3 Changi. However the food on board was terrible. My wife ordered the Japanese Kaiseki and it was not good. My Wagyu Sirloin was leather tough.However Dom Perignon 2004 did help to wash it down. Fortunately the flight back form Seoul on Business was excellent with good food. I think SQ need to re-look at their inflight food standard outbound from SIN.
2015-03-04,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled on DEL-SIN-DEL route a couple of times in the last month and though largely satisfied did think SQ standards are slipping a little. Given its always significantly higher priced compared to competitors I found it a little disappointing. As always no complaint on the service or IFE (except once as below) but was very disappointed with the food served on SIN-DEL leg both times (bland and just not tasty). One of the DEL-SIN flights on an A380 was a little worse than others with the IFE system not functioning properly for a large part of the flight. It had to be reset several times before it worked. Moreover the aircraft seemed a little worse for wear compared to the usual SQ equipment with some seat covers coming off and the toilet barely clean. All in all the problems were not significant but could be a sign of SQ becoming complacent on a route on which it has little to no competition.
2015-02-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,BNE-SIN-CMB-SIN-BNE in Economy Class. Flew A330 on all legs. Seats were comfortable cabin crew were polite and friendly and entertainment was great. If there was any complaints it would be the lack of leg-room (I am 6ft 2') although it may be more than enough for a shorter person. Would definitely fly with again.
2015-02-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-KIX return. Outward flights around 30-40% full and close to 100% on the return. Food poor on the MEL-SIN leg but enjoyable on the remainder. Excellent cabin service by friendly proactive staff including numerous water & juice runs on all legs. Return flights both delayed by around 15 minutes due to luggage having to be removed after 'no-shows'. A good selection on the entertainment system although there were some lags and occasional freezing on the flights to and from KIX. The aircraft interiors all seemed to be in good condition and the seating comfortable despite the seat pitch being a bit tighter than I remember experiencing the last time we flew with the Airline.
2015-02-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,PER-SIN-BOM. B777-200 on both legs. What can I say about Singapore Airlines? Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding followed by drinks and dinner. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. Dinner choices on the PER-SIN leg were limited to Pork Stew and Stir fried beef but they were not too bad. Breakfast was served on the SIN-BOM leg with a choice of Indian crepes or baked eggs with chicken sausage and baked beans. The aircraft's are showing signs of ageing though as some PTVs were not working and a couple of seats in the middle row seem to have had reclining problems. Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.
2015-02-18,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-SIN then SIN-ZRH and return. The flights over were at Christmas so the leg to SIN was packed. Late departure made for a very tight connection at SIN. Attentive service comfortable seat for a day flight and book the cook worked but the food was ok not outstanding. SIN-ZRH on A380 was quite empty upstairs so very attentive service with the whole back part of the cabin to myself. Toilets seemed to be cleaned after every use although they're the smallest I've encountered in a business cabin. The seat was good but the mattress a bit thin and the weird need to put feet in a small box on one side isn't entirely comfortable. Honestly there are much more comfortable options. IFE wasn't as good as others but a decent selection of movies and TV shows available. I can't say I liked all the advertising on it though. Friendly attentive staff clean aircraft and ok food and entertainment but in my opinion there are better options for far less money.
2015-02-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,CPH/SIN - SIN/CPH economy. Two excellent 12 hours flights good seat comfort staff service superior they walk through cabin with juice and water three times per hour staff provide a good atmosphere and spirit in cabin and at all times kept toilets clean. IFE screens needs update too small and inferior image quality. On flight back to CPH captain made very thorough explanation prior to entering severe turbulence this info made many passengers feel better during the one hour rough ride. Have flown SIA regularly for 35 years still my absolute favorite.
2015-01-30,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,I took 2 flights with SQ in Business Class last week: SQ173 SGN-SIN - main dish was inedible - overcooked. SQ528 SIN-MAA - understaffed business class cabin could not prepare the food in time for half of the passengers 90 min wait between the first and second course.
2015-01-28,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.
2015-01-28,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from SYD-SIN-IST Business Class on an ageing 777-200. Aircraft was the same all the way from Sydney to Istanbul. Whilst old the aircraft was very clean and well looked after. Food and Service were very good. The staff were wonderful. The Business Class seats/beds on this aircraft are a little hard compared to seats on other airlines which made it difficult to get comfortable on two night flights back to Turkey. IFE isn't as good as on other airlines or as good as SIA's newer aircraft but didn't affect the journey in a negative way. SIA would do well to offer pyjamas to customers in Business Class in the same way that Qantas do.
2015-01-28,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,I took Singapore Airlines SQ 609 from Seoul to Singapore on 25 January 2015. The inflight entertainment system on that flight was not working properly and I had to swap to another seat to continue watching my movie. From what I understood from the onboard announcement quite a number of passengers were affected as well.
2015-01-26,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,RUH-SIN and back. Outbound flight was March 20 and sadly SQ now stopped this flight. Check in was smooth and RUH was well RUH. SQ 455 left RUH at 11.55pm on time and arrived to SIN at around 1.25pm. The flight attendants are excellent. The food was great and the seat was very good! You could sleep comfortably (it wasn't a lie flat since it was on a A330) and the other positions were very comfortable. The IFE was up to date and entertaining. Everything was on time and arrival at Singapore was perfect. I arrived at T2 and it was empty with barely anyone else there. The flight back was also good (but more crowded) and it was on time and comfortable (but it was a day flight so I didn't sleep). I would recommend.
2015-01-26,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Amsterdam - Singapore - Singapore - Perth. The first leg was probably the best long haul flight I've been on. Service was excellent with drinks served regularly along with snacks and the meals where pretty good. The seat was really comfortable and plenty of leg room (I thought I was in Business class with the amount of leg room).
2015-01-26,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew economy on 12 November from Sydney to Singapore. The service was excellent. The staff are so kind and helpful. Busy looking after all passengers the whole flight. Seats very comfortable. I was in the first row after business class and had tons of leg room. The food wine and entertainment second to none. Toilets exceptionally clean with good products supplied.
2015-01-23,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flew IST-SIN SIN-SYD on B777-200. One of the aircraft had been ""refitted"". Both had quite hard seats. For the first sector I was seated in 51A which on a night flight gets a direct beam of light coming from the toilets on a regular basis. It's quite disturbing and I wouldn't recommend this seat to economy passengers in this part of the cabin. The inflight entertainment is dated and the screens quite small compared to other aircraft in the SIA fleet and other airlines particularly the second sector where the screen was exceptionally small. This must have been one of the oldest aircraft in the SIA fleet. It seems SIA reserve their ageing aircraft for the IST route. The inflight service on both legs of the journey was very average. I ordered a special meal so received my meal first however it took over an hour to get a drink to go with my meal which is served when the rest of the meals are served. I think there is some room for improvement here from SIA. I was surprised to have to remind the cabin crew about my missing drink as normally their service is second to none. The food was fine and well above average although the coffee not always hot. Check in staff were quite good at IST and as with almost every flight I have ever taken departing from Ataturk Airport it was a delayed departure - this flight by 45 minutes."
2015-01-21,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Our trip was Copenhagen-Singapore-Bali and return. Staff were very pleasant and smiling. The food was the best airplane meal I have had it was delicious and there was plenty of it. Seats where fine and the entertainment system on all 4 flights was up to date. Your boarding cards gets you discounts on various attractions in Singapore so keep them. Changi Airport is the best airport I have seen so green and a lot to do and see if you have to wait a long time.
2015-01-21,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore Airlines has finally upgraded their product on the Singapore - Bali route. Although the A330 is not my favourite plane the SQ A330 has the upgraded regional biz product in a 2-2-2 configuration which is way better than the old standard recliner biz seats on the 777-200. Happy to see the new product on this popular route.
2015-01-21,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I travelled to Australia via Singapore on the 10th Dec and returned on the 14th Jan. On both sectors out and back I received excellent service from the cabin staff. The choice of food was entertainment was very good and although it is a long journey the staff were polite and understanding. I will definitely be using Singapore Airlines again and was particularly impressed with the A380 airliner.
2015-01-19,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flown from SIN to BNE in Business. The aircraft an older A330 Seats were not flat the service acceptable but not 5 stars. Breakfast was not hot but just lukewarm. For that reason I was not keen in eating it. In my humble opinion that is the product is totally overpriced and it selling it on the name only. After the emerging of the middle eastern carriers you can see the features and benefits other airlines give you. Other airlines talk about. Please don't get me wrong the airline is acceptable and is better than other airlines but compared to what you pay and what you get I am sorry I would not like to buy this product again.
2015-01-19,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Having just returned from spending Christmas and New Year with family in Australia travelling Singapore Airlines 777-300er from Manchester-Singapore-Perth flight SQ327. I was allocated the worst seat on the plane seat no. 56G on the back row my knees were pushed up against the seat in front couldn't stretch my legs out under the seat in front because the seat was so close had to keep getting up to stretch my legs. I would like to know who allocates the seat number its not the travel agent he can only request an aisle/window seat is it Singapore Airlines at the time of booking (booked 5 months in advance) was it the only seat available? Is it the people who book 48 hours before on line or is it at check out at Manchester. I would have thought the back row was reserves for people on stand by or last minute bookings. Travelled many times with Singapore and always found them to be one of the best but not this time. Not a happy pensioner.
2015-01-14,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,LAX-NRT-SIN with no ground customer service to be found anywhere. The usually short refuelling stop in NRT became an overnight 17 hr delay due to Engine problems. Singapore Airlines held us on the plane for over 4 hrs and insisted on serving us the inflight dinner rather than let the passengers disembark. The hotel provided for Economy class was (Nikko Narita) was rather on the run-down side. First and Business where hosted at the local Hilton and another hotel (Did not catch the name). We had a connection to MDC the next morning in Singapore which we missed. That connection only flies every other day so that we had to stay two days in Singapore over Christmas rather than on our vacation. The biggest problem was that no-one on the phone or the ground staff in NRT could provide us with a new itinerary to our destination. To add insult to injury the first phone representative insisted that my flight had taken off as planned even though I had called almost 3 hrs after the delay started. The second one was even worse in first refusing to help at all as he claimed I had deviated from my booked LAX-SIN itinerary. It was only after some complaining that he finally realized that NRT is indeed on the route. Not that he had any further information to offer after that other than saying I would get more information in Singapore. Once finally in Singapore the representative at the gate who was supposed to have our onward information did not and had us wait for another length of time at the transfer desk in Singapore. There finally I was handed the boarding passes to our final destination and hotel vouchers. I am Executive Platinum with American Airlines and have seen my fair share of breakdowns and delays. However without fail an AA representative on the phone has been able to give me my new route/times within minutes of the official announcement of the delay. Onboard service on Singapore Airlines is certainly better than on AA. That said I will gladly trade in a bit of comfort for the knowledge that I am being taken care in a timely manner if something does not go to plan.
2015-01-14,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,SFO-HK I was disappointed in the overall experience. It appears to me the airline is cutting corners and not keeping up with the ME carriers. The seat although wide is not particularly comfortable in the seated position. The fully reclined position was better but the bed was hard. They would do well to add a comforter on the sleeping surface to provide a softer experience. They used to provide an amenities kit- no longer. The food too was just not as good as it used to be. If they want to retain their ratings they better spend a bit more on their business class product.
2015-01-14,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled AKL-SIN on the old 777 with the incline bed. There was no topper pad for the seat so very uncomfortable to try and sleep. This is a 10 hour flight so it was not up to scratch. These days you really expect more in Business class. There are also 6 seats across so there is not a lot of room to spread out. The food was only just acceptable but as the flight left at 1am we didn't feel like much anyway. I think Singapore need to review their fares on this aircraft as it was barely a step up from premium economy on other airlines. The way back SIN-CHC is the refurbished 777 with a lie flat bed and 4 seats across. A quite different experience. A lot more room and even though it feels a bit weird to sleep diagonally it was fine. 2 comfy pillows. I had tried to book the cook but I didn't think it had worked online as couldn't see it in our booking but on arriving home found confirmation emails that it had but we didn't get our requested meals on the plane so don't know what happened there. The food was really good anyway. Service was fantastic from the crew in fact it was the best part of the experience. In Singapore they allowed our two sons (21 and 17)who were travelling with us but in economy to come into the lounge as we had 6 hours there which was really appreciated. On both trips the movie selection was dismal and the only amenities given out were a pair of slippers and an eye mask . There were some toothbrushes in the bathroom but they were all out on the way to Sin. This was our 1st time travelling business with Singapore and have to say was slightly underwhelmed compared to our other experiences.
2015-01-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I am a very satisfied frequent traveler on SQ and this review only covers the way they serve their special meals in general and the inconvenience this procedure causes on short flights. I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.

2015-01-05,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,BKK-SIN-MEL. Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible on the way home inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.
2015-01-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Narita to Singapore on an A380 Meal was great service was top notch everything was close to perfection. What makes SQ special is that even if you are seated in coach the crew provides you with business class level of service and try their best to make your flight enjoyable. The only downside is that Singapore Airlines is usually more expensive than other airlines. Yet I am willing to pay more to travel on this airline.
2015-01-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Took the A380 Suite HKG-SIN on 19 Dec. Flight departed slightly late but arrived on time. Great service and seat - amazingly comfortable seat. The only downside is the lack of storage. Could only store handbag under the ottoman. IFE choices were extensive and updated. Was given free 15MB WiFi. Pre-ordered Book the Cook's Lobster Thermidor and it deserves its online reputation. The rest of the courses were mediocre - more like Business Class food. Service was excellent as expected of SQ except that the FA forgot to return me my coat at the end of the flight causing me to walk halfway to Arrival only to turn back upon realizing my forgotten coat.
2014-12-31,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland return Nov/Dec 2014. All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.
2014-12-31,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and back. Boeing 777-300 on MEL-SIN had one of the oldest IFE screens I have ever seen on SIA (flying since 2010). Priority meal for other passengers around me meant I had to wait for ages for a meal. SIN to MEL was a brand new A330-300 and had nice IFE and dinner served on board was the best I have had inflight. Serving dinner in the late night and keeping lights on meant there is no way you can sleep properly. I will still fly SIA because of their hospitality and cabin comfort.
2014-12-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a 777. Singapore to Delhi on the A380 and Singapore to Adelaide on the A330. In terms of seat space the oldest one ie the 777 was the most comfortable. I am 1m73 and the Airbus both felt cramped. On the other hand the inflight entertainment on the 777 was pretty poor with scarce visibility of the screen which makes it impossible to read subtitles on foreign films. The IFE on the Airbus was much better. The cabin and toilets were clean and the crew was polite and efficient on all flights. My main complaints are first with the food. I ordered a Lacto-Ovo vegetarian meal which was pretty standard. On all the outbound flights (and I'm not a fussy person) the meals were almost inedible. The other problem is that as they serve the special meals a long time ahead of the normal meals I ended up sitting in an upright position with my tray for over 90 mins not good. On the Airbus the trays are too big for the foldable table and therefore it keeps on sliding it's really annoying. The white wine was also not very good. My second complaint would be with the ground staff. They were particularly unhelpful at check-in in Melbourne. All I wanted was 2 seats together but they made such a big deal of it all and because I had booked under the Virgin Australia flight numbers I couldn't check in online 48hrs prior so that wasn't my fault. Plus on the outbound we only had 1 hr transit and because the flight was delayed we ended up having to run between the 2 terminals with no help from ground staff whatsoever so that was very poor customer service considering the delay was the airline's fault to start with. We did make our connection but it could have been handled a bit better. Overall I am disappointed and didn't find this airline to be that much better than any other ones. Not worth the extra money anyway.
2014-12-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,B777-300ER (SIN-LHR). Overall the flight was fabulous. From pre-take off to airborne to landing all cabin crews make their very best effort to keep the service went well throughout the flight. Cabin crews were attentive friendly and helpful. Cabin crews were always appeared in the cabin and went around to serve passengers some drinks and snacks after the meal services. The food was delicious. The cabin was very comfortable especially the lighting. I was lucky enough to board their brand new Boeing 777-300ER. Take off and landing were smooth without much noises. Also the lavatory were in clean condition all the time. This is the airline worth flying with and I would recommend to the others. Although I was flying Economy class I felt I was being treated as a business class or first class passengers.
2014-12-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Paris CDG - Singapore SIN A380. Everything was fantastic. The flight was on time. Cabin crews were very attentive and friendly throughout the flight. Food was good and toilet was clean all the time. Cabin crew were soft spoken with great language proficiency. My only complaint is to upgrade their inflight entertainment like the one they have in 777-300ER. Have flown with other major airlines to the majority of European cities SQ is still my favorite. Overall I am very satisfied with the airline and a big thumb up to the crew members. I would fly with SQ and recommend this airline to my friends and relatives.
2014-12-22,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore Airlines is slowly losing it on their long-haul business class compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. I used to love this seat 7 years ago when they launched it however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories. Moreover the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard as well as during the Tokyo layover with no success. Since the flight was full I couldn't change seats. The food though was outstanding.
2014-12-18,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew with my 7 year old son from ADL to LHR direct. Experience with faults and the airports excellent too. The staff remembered our small requests and returned throughout the flight to say that they had not forgotten. My son's request from the standard adult menu was given first. Our seats were comfortable and the plane clean. The food was good but meat a bit tough the Asian option was better. I have flown Adelaide to London frequently and this trip was the best by far. From check-in through to meeting my family at Arrivals I could not find fault. It's a long flight but I felt the better for it (and family commented on it too!) at the end due to it being so easy. Singapore Airlines really are the best for economy long haul.
2014-12-18,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ Flight 346 SIN - ZRH on the A380. The flight leaves very early in the morning at 01.30. Singapore Airlines should really change the meal service concept on this flight. Having to endure a full service this early in the morning is just cruel torture when passengers would actually would just want the lights to go out and go to sleep. Why not hand out meal vouchers to passengers with plenty of time in transit to eat at a restaurant at SIN airport and then serve only a light snack on the plane after takeoff. Seats in business class look impressive but are unsupportive in the sitting position and too hard and too short when used as a bed. F&B service as well as inflight entertainment were very good. Crew were also doing a good job. Service overall however was slower at the rear end of the business compartment. Probably also because the top deck was a two class business/economy layout and I was sitting at the far end of the service rotation.
2014-12-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Jakarta-Singapore-Bangkok. The check in from Soekarno-Hatta and Changi was handled quickly but it took a little bit longer in Suvarnabhumi. Staff were friendly and hospitable. The inflight entertainment was wonderful! I like their travel magazine. The economy seats were standard but kind of uncomfortable (for me). The food was good with an average portion. There were no delays and they gave me and my family who were also travelling with me a S$20 voucher for every passenger (didn't know what promo that was). The price was also satisfactory and worth the flight experience. Will definitely fly with SQ again.
2014-12-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,DME-HOU-DME (flight SQ 062 and back with SQ 061): traveled to Houston with SA for business purposes. It was very nice and comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very friendly and openly. Food is very good and drinks as well. Three years ago I have flew the same flight and service is still on top level. Very good airline.
2014-12-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 15 - Sep 29. SQ402 - Oct 1. SQ5357 Oct 24. SQ16 - Oct 25 2014. I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990 when they had their 747-400 Megatop almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ the service and amenities always amaze me a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.
2014-12-04,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,BNE-SIN-ICN and return on Economy. Consistently great service in all four flights the cabin crew were very attentive. Food and drinks were excellent in generous servings and the movie selection on IFE is more than acceptable. I always love their signature cocktail Singapore Sling. The seat was a lot more spacious than I expected after having flown with other airlines in the US the month before. I thoroughly enjoyed all flights although having an empty seat next to me in all 4 flights might be one of the key contributing factors. I am a frequent flyer and I have to say this trip is one of the best I have had.
2014-12-01,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,We flew to Phuket via Singapore and as with previous trips the flight went without a hitch. The service was great and the staff worked really hard to satisfy all. The food was above average and filling and the drink service well above board.
2014-12-01,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Singapore to Beijing as flight SQ802 on the 15th of November 2014 and returning back to Singapore as flight SQ807 on the 22nd of November 2014. It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on. Food was much better on the return sector on the flight as it was served much warmer. I had a great experience with Singapore Airlines and I would recommend it anytime.
2014-11-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Sydney to Zurich then Amsterdam back to Sydney. Staff were attentive and courteous. They worked very hard throughout the flight to keep things running smoothly. The toilets were clean the food was good and the flights were all on time. I would fly with Singapore again.
2014-11-20,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled CHC to SIN on 777. Lots of legroom IFE poor as screen too dark despite maximum adjustment and passenger announcements not loud enough. Staff ever helpful and smiling. Food on menu not great but snacks were. Flight on time. Then SIN to LHR on A380. Seating hard less legroom and very cold but preferable to being too warm. Needed the blanket! Food much better and staff excellent as usual. IFE had good choices but screen repeatedly froze and others experienced the same. Managed a good amount of sleep as plane so quiet but had to request eye mask and ear plugs. Why don't they ditch the stupid socks in the amenity pack which I have hardly ever seen anyone wearing and include eye masks and earplugs along with the toothbrush? Flight on time. Will definitely use them again. My 8th flight with SIA.
2014-11-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ12 Sep 1st 2014. I flew from Tokyo NRT to Los Angeles on their A380. Flight left on time boarding was smooth and excellent service on board. Flight attendant extremely friendly and approachable great food and drinks (being served wine on a glass and not on a plastic cup in economy was amazing) and wonderful entertainment (they even had Italian series in it). My only critique would be more leg room. Would surely recommend them to others and look forward to flying SA again.
2014-11-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-DPS. Flew on the A380 and booked the preferred seating for extra legroom. While this was a blessing the reduction in seat width wasn't ideal. The seats were a little too firm for my liking. Other than that the experience was fantastic. Entertainment choice was plentiful the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent. All requests were met with a smile and service is miles ahead of other airlines.
2014-11-17,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Rome to Perth October 17. Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident I will still fly with them though.
2014-11-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from SIN-MNL-SIN. Although a relatively short haul flight the crew were exceptional and never stopped smiling. The great SQ smile. Anyone interested in being pampered at 37000 feet with the best in service opt for SQ.
2014-11-06,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ967 CGK-SIN / SQ306 SIN-LHR. Jakarta to London. First leg B777-200. Old but clean. I like the fact that SQ offers various dietary menu even for economy class passengers. Ordered a fruit platter and was superb. Second leg B777-300ER year 2006 cabin. Cabin a bit old but clean. Nice food attentive flight attendants. Although flight was full service standards did not go down. Two thumbs up as always.
2014-11-06,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,Can't complain about the staff and the service provided by them my problem is the delay that affected my trip. Dubai to Singapore was delayed which resulted in me missing my connection to Bangkok and rebooked on the following flight 3hrs later when returning back faced another delay from Singapore to Dubai. Have been using Singapore Airlines over 10 years and never faced this issue before.
2014-11-03,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Brisbane to Beijing via Singapore and returned two weeks later from Shanghai back to Brisbane. The food entertainment and service was all very good and I particularly enjoyed the wide selection of the latest movies and music that they had to offer. All flights departed and landed on time. Food was nice but the breakfasts were not great. On the flights between Oz and Singapore we flew on the 777-330 with a modern clean interior and a very spacious amount of leg room possibly the most leg room I have ever had onboard a long-haul flight. The flight between Shanghai and Singapore was the worst - with very little leg room and felt quite cramped.
2014-11-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,28 Oct Flt OZ574. 29 Oct Flt SQ609. 29 Oct Flt SQ 237. Clean planes comfortable seats. Attentive staff. Everything an airline should be.
2014-10-31,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,PER-SIN-AMS in business class first leg on 777-200ER refitted and second leg on 777-300ER. The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food nice drinks and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub but starts showing its age. However coming back to SQs one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout which is perfectly fine and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging to wide and short for sitting and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back) is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen less choice and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding taxi and take-off are over. Anyway flying business with SQ is of course still a treat but others do much better today. Am curious to discover SQ's new business class product which is now being rolled out for its longer range routes.
2014-10-31,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,My wife and I flew SQ256/S366 BNE-SIN-FCO in October and returned on SQ365/255 in November. The outbound flight from BNE was excellent. The staff could not be faulted. The seats and the IFE were excellent. We took advantage of book the cook from Singapore and the food was of a very high standard and well presented. The only stumble on the SIN-FCO sector is the old style IFE. My wife slept comfortably on the lie down bed The return from FCO was good - excellent service and good meals but once again - old IFE. We had chosen book the cook for the sector SIN-BNE but it was a let down - overheated and not very palatable or well presented. The staff did the best they could but it was a let down after 3 great sectors.
2014-10-28,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ306 16/10/2014 SIN-LHR. I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.
2014-10-28,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Singapore from Brisbane to Paris via Singapore and then return on the same path. Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts! After telling the flight attendant he was most apologetic and gave me and my family potato chips instead. Overall the meals were ok - especially good from Paris! Flew on the A380 between Singapore and Paris and there was plenty of room so were able to spread out and have a proper sleep! Flight attendants were most attentive and seemed to rush up and offer you more food or drink as soon as you showed any sign of waking up. Overall quite a good experience and I would recommend this airline!
2014-10-28,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Simply perfect! Zurich to Singapore and back from Denpasar to Zurich via Singapore with my family. I bought the tickets online through their web site taking advantage of a special offer they extremely cheap. Upon reservation I was immediately allowed to choose the seats and special meals (I am vegetarian). Every flight was perfectly on time or landed early. Seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment excellent. My special meal arrived at the same time of other meals warm and very good other meals were also good. Large variety of drinks and good wine. Several times during the flight they offered water juices and snacks. I was travelling with a 4yr old child who was continuously spoiled by the cabin crew with gifts and additional food. We asked for sandwiches and snacks several times and they offered them immediately. Getting in the aircraft on the way back I remarked that the seat belt on my seat was broken. Ground staff arrived immediately they dismantled the seat and changed the belt. The whole operation did not take more than 5 minutes! A special word to the cabin crew it was not my first flight with Singapore Airlines and I am always astonished by how lovely caring and professional they are! They are always smiling never get nervous or stressed and are extremely efficient they never forget something you ask them!
2014-10-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,JFK-FRA-SIN-PVG and back to JFK. A380 on JFK-SIN and 777-300ER on SIN-PVG. Everything with Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport was superb. Great entertainment system great food great service great airplanes great economy seats. The food is delicious for asian taste they are one of the best I've seen. My feeder flight was delayed on my way to PVG so I missed my PVG-SIN flight. The SIA staff in PVG changed my ticket without any question or fee. The inflight entertainment on FRA-SIN leg was not functioning properly. When disembarking in SIN the airline staff gave every passenger a gift of leather wallet as compensation and apologized personally to everyone. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines. They deserve to be a 5 star airline. I will definitely fly SIA again. If there was one thing bad is that I didn't really like their check-in staff in JFK.
2014-10-28,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ markets itself as a premium brand airline. My recent experience SIN-MEL-SIN does not confirm this: small seats in economy class food and beverages left a lot to be desired and slow service. The one positive thing I can say is that they were on-time. All in all a poor value-for-money performance.
2014-10-28,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Perth-Singapore-Rome and return. Have been flying with SQ on and off for the over 20 years. Still the best airline to travel with. A true 5 star performer which has withstood the test of time.
2014-10-28,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I returned economy class from the UK on a London/Singapore on an Airbus A380-800 and Singapore/Brisbane on an Airbus A330-300. The previous flights out had been great mainly because the planes were only 3/4 full so everyone could spread out. However the flights back to Australia were jam-packed and sitting there squashed in my seat like the proverbial sardine I came to the realisation of what the airline had in mind when it purchased the A380 and it wasn't my comfort. Further this aircraft seems to be simply a larger version of what was available before so it takes ages to board and disembark as there are so many more people. In the departure lounge those of us in economy were forced to endure cognitive dissonance having to stand in a queue while those in Business and First class were given priority boarding. Can't these people be whisked into the aircraft out of sight? The A330 on the Singapore/Brisbane leg seemed to be quite aged. Further it was freezing. A few things were broken (eg the lid on the rubbish bin in the toilet). This seemed a basic thing to be broken also rather unhygienic. The sinks appeared to be stained. There does not seem to be enough toilets for the numbers of people on the plane. Economy class seating seems to be encased in metal with no padding to soften the blow. When the metal gets cold due to the freezing temperature this metal is decidedly uncomfortable. The thin polyester blankets supplied are barely adequate. They need to be twice as large and several times the tog rating ameliorate the cold. The things the airline boast about - food entertainment service - are all quite good but in the end I would be happier to spend the entire flight lying down in silence in darkness with a warm blanket and perhaps a good book that I can read by the light of my iphone.
2014-10-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled LHR-SIN-LHR on A380. Everything fine apart from the Air-Con at the rear of the plane on the upper deck. Paid extra for seats with leg room but was frozen both ways (esp legs and feet) We were told that this is due to the exit doors and the chilling equipment in the galley. Was shown the overall cabin temp (which said 24 but felt like -24 in your seat). SQ really needs to look at this but it maybe an Airbus thing rather than SQ.
2014-10-22,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled HKG-SIN on 30 September on the A380. Flight departed around 30 minutes later than scheduled but overall the flight was smooth and we arrived on time. Seat was uncomfortably wide but made better by the 2 cushions on each side. It was a pity that the seat including the storage compartments looked dirty old and worn. Maintenance could have been better - have seen older but cleaner A330 from Asiana. Food-wise is the usual Business Class fare nothing spectacular but was of good quality and quantity. Service was prompt and friendly.
2014-10-20,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to Milan Rome to Singapore. The flight to Milan was a Boeing 777-300. Service was again excellent throughout the flight and deserved praise. Food and IFE was great. The return flight from Rome was old model Boeing 777-200ER. The plane although looked new on the outside was old on the inside. IFE screen was poor and far outdated then the one they currently use on their newer models. Though I felt more comfortable in the seats. However I do not know why SIA still doesn't retire this old model. Clearly footrest seats and even the IFE was in a need of repair. Service on this flight was not as great as the previous flight. Request were sometimes miss and food options ran out something i had not experience before with SIA. A letdown this time for the return flight. I would still recommend based on the outbound flight from Singapore.
2014-10-20,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew with Singapore Airlines in September between CGK and SIN then proceeded to PEN with their subsidiary SilkAir (return). As an athlete I had to travel with my equipment which are large in size and heavy. On the first leg the check in process was smooth as there were no lines although the plane was full. We were scheduled to fly on a 777-200/200ER but due to maintenance issues they instead used a 777-300ER which has better seats IFE and was spotless clean inside out. Boarding process was quick and flight attendants greeted everyone with a smile and addressed some of the passengers by name. What disappointed me was that they did not switch on the much expected IFE until almost halfway through the journey and to my surprise the food was both below standard (I tried both options). On the leg back they used the 777-300 classic series which was also clean inside out. Seamless boarding process yet again and great food. I shopped from the SilverKris magazine for the special F1 merchandise and it was a smooth process as well. But to my disappointment they did not switch on the IFE at all. For the time being I will opt for SkyTeam carriers Garuda Indonesia and Air France which allows me to pay less but get the same results.
2014-10-20,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,Return trip to Adelaide via Singapore. Would not use this airline again nor would I recommend travelling with Singapore Airlines. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped extremely poor inflight entertainment the food was an ice cream dessert that was still frozen and inedible. One of the meals contained pork so tough I could not cut through it. Another meal that was supposed to be beef just consisted mainly of gristle. The only good part of all four flights was that most of the cabin staff were efficient and helpful. I found the whole experience extremely disappointing and certainly poor value for money.
2014-10-13,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,ZRH-SIN-SGN and back with A380/777-200. All in all nice flights with very good cabin service and an unbeatable Changi Airport. Positive: Staff very attentive and professional food of good quality good IFE reliability and safety. Great and well-priced stop-over program which has a lot to offer. Negatives: Though seat pitch of 32 in is not bad the seats on the A380 are not very comfortable sleeping is quite difficult. For the price you pay for SIA they could have gone easily for 33-34 inches. The cabin is wide and silent the windows are a bit far from the seat. The food is nice though i ate better food on Qatar for example. The 777-200 are a bit old and worn out not up to date. Though SIA is one of the best airlines I've flown with I don't think they offer the best Economy experience there are better products on the markets like Qatar Asiana or Garuda or Malaysia Airlines.
2014-10-13,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-HKG and return flew out on 7 Sep 12.05 a.m. on a 777/300 - older plane but service good arr SIN 6.30.am connected to HKG - this flight also good. Return HKG-SIN-MEL both legs on A380 - what a plane service seemed better than the outward leg. Could not fault cabin crew - all flights full. All in all will definitely fly with SQ again.
2014-10-13,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,The overnight Airbus A380 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Saturday October 4th was one of the best flights we have experienced. The seats were comfortable the leg room was adequate and the meals or snacks were very good. Best of all was the frequency with which drinks were brought round so that the demand from passengers using the call button was minimal ensuring very little disturbance for the 13 hour night flight. The 11.30 pm departure and 6.30 am arrival helps get over the jet lag provided one can sleep during the flight.
2014-10-13,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from HKG-SIN onboard a B777-300ER (9V-SWO). The seats were fairly comfortable there was a good selection of movies on the IFE system. The food was good and the flight attendants were friendly. The only problem was that the PTV was not touch screen and the seats were getting a little worn out. I then flew back to Hong Kong on one of their 777-200's (9V-SRO). The aircraft had been retrofitted however the TV's were still old and the remote was stuck on the side of my armrest. Being 180cm the legroom was insufficient as their was an IFE box under the seat in front of me. Even with a massive box to run the IFE it was still slow. Once in the air the movie I was watching kept pausing because I kept accidentally banging the remote as it was on the side of my armrest. The food was good and the crew were impressive and had learnt the names of all the kids seated around me prior to the flight. After having the meal the lights were dimmed for the remaining hour. Even though the 777-200 hand been retrofitted it was obviously done in a rush as the remotes and TV's were still old. The crew are very good and the food is good however their seats are getting old and all their aircraft could do with an upgrade or replacement.
2014-10-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,BNE-SIN and then Silk Air SIN-CEB. Seating comfortable and the food and overall service was great. What can you say about the cabin crew they are above the best both directions the flight was well on time and connections and transfers met. The overall service provided across all levels of both Singapore and Silk Air exemplary. An airline is only as good as the crew that it employs and to that end they are the best in what they do.
2014-10-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,From Frankfurt Germany to JFK. A380 had a great flight was 30 mins late but the flight experience was great. Seats were comfortable and inflight service was good. I would recommend this airline.
2014-09-28,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,I have recently flown HKG-SIN-HKG on B777-200 economy. Singapore airlines not only did not meet the expectations but were also below the average level of other airlines. The plane was old. The seats were old and the in-flight entertainment system was outdated. The selection of movies was very limited. The food served on board was basic. The meals were served long after take off forcing you to be awake for the most part of the flight and fall asleep just when it is time to land. Never again.
2014-09-28,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,We took four long haul flights with Singapore Airlines in June and July and were frankly disappointed. On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon and insisted the window shade be drawn when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them on the basis of their reputation for service which was poor. Meal service was slow and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow so it can be done!
2014-09-24,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I boarded the Airbus flying from London to Singapore on 18 September it was two hours late owing to technical difficulties. Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting. The steward said there had been difficulties with Apple products. Potential customers need to know this as it could be important to work during a long haul trip. I had been relatively pleased with Singapore Airlines but my experience on the Airbus has left me wandering if I would fly with them again.
2014-09-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 224 and SQ 401 4-5th Sep. Best service. Flew MEL-SIN-DEL A380 super efficient service. Got upper deck which had ample space. Overall a great trip.
2014-09-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"NYC to Frankfurt to Singapore. SQ25 8/23. Singapore to Heathrow to Boston. SQ308 8/30. We were very impressed with Singapore Airlines service from beginning to end. The food/beverage service was unlike any we have ever had on an airplane. The flight crew was more attentive than I have experienced at an elegant restaurant! The access to and variety of entertainment (movies and music) exceeded our expectations. The ""little extras"" (such as hot towels at the beginning and end of each flight socks and toothbrushes) were a pleasant and welcome surprise. Overall Singapore Airlines made a grueling 24hr flight much more tolerable! The only criticisms I would offer are the poor leg room (particularly in the middle section) and the location of the security check-in prevented the use of restrooms restaurants and shopping after going through security. We usually check in early enough to ensure there is ample time to handle any issues that could arise and then we use the restrooms/eat/fill water bottles/shop/etc after we are all set for the flight."
2014-09-14,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Sep 5th and Sep 9th PVG-SIN return trip. A380-800 on all legs. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines several times. I think they are on a downward slope. Both trips were on an A380-800(9V-SKK) the inflight entertainment was a little bit old and wasn't a touch screen. The seat pitch is little bit narrow and I'm 175cm. Next SIA have kept a lot of traditions such as the hot towel service menu distributed to all classes of passengers etc. Catering quality in SIA is still high food was freshly prepared beverages were plentiful wines and cocktails are never out of stock. Most of the cabin crews provide service with a smile. Overall a nice trip and good experience.
2014-09-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,The Amsterdam flight is on the retrofitted 777-200ER which is excellent except for the business class IFE which is still the old version. It seems that SQ has decided not to upgrade the IFE on this retrofit thus the movie selection is not as grand the user interface is old and the pix quality of the screen is lower. I have always loved the SQ biz class seat for I find it a good balance between privacy and comfort. The meals were superb as was the service.
2014-09-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew Singapore Airlines 777-300ER - on 21st August - Manchester Airport to Singapore on SQ327 then Singapore to Sydney on SQ 211 and I can only praise all the cabin crew working on all the sectors for their professionalism politeness attentiveness when assisting passengers and serving meals drinks and snacks. The food served was of great quality tasty and hot and throughout the long sectors the cabin staff were constantly serving beverages and snacks. Inflight entertainment had newly released films.
2014-09-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flown with SQ from CGK-SIN-CDG last December in their B777-200 and A380-800 respectively. Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure. Although their seats are rock-hard the legroom is all that I could ask from a cattle class (I am 184cm tall that is a smidge over 6 feet). The IFE was good even though it is a little bit outdated it was still decent. The food? Inappropriately good! You should try the infamous Singapore Sling too! The service was well-mannered well- presented and well-trained cabin crews. The same goes with the return leg.
2014-09-01,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew MEL-SIN-FRA and Munich-SIN-MEL in Aug 2013. Excellent staffing food and IFE system. 1st flight automatic upgrade to bulkhead seat which had so much room! Dream flight. 2nd flight got put on last row windows seat. Nightmarish as so limited room! Plane on 2nd flights both times had severe turbulence to extent the food- servicing was suspended. Plane was old had leaking liquid from a baggage door! Nevertheless given amenity pack and offered plenty of drinks etc. Very good experience especially when I got to Changi airport.
2014-09-01,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,I have flown with them for quite some time now and while their service is usually robotic impersonal and lacking warmth flying with other airlines makes you appreciate how Singapore just does it right. Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again. They are extremely reliable their hard product is among the best and while their service is inconsistent when it comes to friendliness their efficiency is one of the best out there.
2014-08-28,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ975 BKK-SIN A330 J - I was looking forward to my first flight with Singapore in what some consider the best business class in the sky. The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good but drinks service was infrequent. All in all this experience was comparable to a domestic business class on a US carrier - certainly far short of the Singapore Airlines I was expecting.
2014-08-28,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ978 SIN-DPS B772 J. This was the second leg of the journey from BKK to DPS and despite the outdated regional J seats on this aircraft type it was far more enjoyable than the previous leg. The crew were friendly and professional and the service was very nicely done. We were called by name throughout the flight and rarely did a glass get below half full. Overall quite satisfactory.
2014-08-26,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,6 flights in July. Auckland - Singapore SGN-BKK Da Nang - SGN. SGN - Cebu. Cebu - SGN and SGN-AKL. All were full. At least 3 were late to varying degrees. On at least one occasion I suspect the delay was not due to congestion at Da Nang for goodness sake but due to late arrival. Only the first flight seemed a bit superior. That seemed to me to be small differences eg - a decent filled roll as a snack but mainly the staff worked hard all the time and seemed to have a service ethic. The food well - Take the coffee cup the wine glass the tub of water and the roll off the tray and really you are not left with much. Surprisingly the food on the SIN - BKK flight at 1600 hours was much the same as on a long flight. However usually it was a dry entree or a few small pieces of fruit plus in effect a snack box sized meal. The Cebu - SGN flight arriving at around 2030 about 1.5 hours late offered a snack box with 3 small cubes of chicken and a cm deep flavoured rice and perhaps a piece of broccoli - most children eat more. Spirits were not offered on the longer flights although they were available out of view nor wine top ups. A beer amounted to perhaps 80 mls that is 4 pours to the can. A little generosity goes a long way as does the impression of parsimony. Overall much the same as other airlines. The best food was on a Vietnam Air 1.25 hour flight where they managed to serve and clear a good meal. Although Singapore seemed to cope with routine any variation seemed to cause problems. One confirmed flight was rescheduled and a second rescheduled to another with a stopover making it two hours longer. Both were weeks in advance. I don't believe either flight was in fact rescheduled rather I was bumped. In the latter case although I was notified of a rescheduling it was much later that I noticed it was in fact a route change. On the return flight which had been altered some months before I had paid for a preferred seat. This was confirmed that I had the same seat. However in fact on the day I was given a non-preferred seat in the centre. This was drawn to the cabin crews’attention and they informed me they would and did inform the appropriate department as if that helped me at the time. Three weeks later no response. A refund would not even compensate for the relative discomfort. Had that seat not been available I would have taken the day flight on the un-refurbished plane they left us with for a year until they introduce a new plane.
2014-08-26,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew with Singapore Airlines for the first time from HKG-SIN and back. What a contrast from the airlines in North America. The staff were incredibly attentive the food was good and the seats were comfortable. This was in the A380 on the upper deck.
2014-08-26,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ947 and SQ378 Aug 19 2014. DPS-SIN and SIN-MXP. Nice flights attendants were perfect meal ok too many uninteresting movies.
2014-08-20,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Osaka to SIN. No bottled water provided. Requested the Japanese breakfast and the meal came without the fish. Anyway shared the fish with my daughter who ordered the same meal and it was very salty. Requested warm water twice and the crew earnestly promised but never delivered. Upon landing while the aircraft was still cruising we could hear the crew arguing loudly among themselves as we occupied the last few row of seats - very unprofessional.
2014-08-20,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Hong Kong to Singapore. I have travelled on Singapore Airlines B777-200 on the last segment of my trip. The aircraft was old the inflight entertainment system is poor and the seat is also old. I was quite surprised to see that Singapore Airlines is still flying with this old thing. Food was just acceptable but nothing special. The meal service (dinner) was very late. This keeps you awake for most of the flight waiting for the dinner and just fall to sleep a few minutes before arrival.
2014-08-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Sydney to Singapore on A380 SQ232 and Singapore to KL on SQ118. The SQ232 flight was outstanding. Very efficient crew with turnaround time for bell call being less than a minute. It was a rather smooth ride food excellent and good entertainment selection. SQ118 was a short flight of 45 minutes but again crew was excellent and proved why its still one of the best.
2014-08-14,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,The service on this short (less than 2 hour) flight and the delicious meal is what made the SQ flight experience outstanding. For the old 777-200 with the very old business class is certainly nothing to brag about.
2014-08-11,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew outward BCN-SIN via Milan as part of a MAD-KUL journey. For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that. In all entirely satisfactory product but not outstanding or memorable although customer care at check-in was well beyond usual experience.
2014-08-11,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Gold Frequent Flyer with Singapore Airlines for last seven years. Regularly upgrade to business class. Singapore's new planes are for the most part very good. There is however an increasing indifference to FF status in economy. The last three economy trips Singapore sales staff on allocating seating have assured me that ""no aisle seats further forward are available"". When checking online however there have been several - it's just that the aisle seats have been beside other vacant seats."
2014-08-08,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,RUH-SIN-MNL-SIN-RUH in economy. One thing I can say about this airline - excellent landings. I will miss this airline when it removes the Riyadh route in September or October 2014. Clean inflight food and entertainment is excellent.
2014-08-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Perth to London and back great service flight and plenty of food. Travelled by the A380 777 A330 with ample leg room for someone tall. Food was very good for a vegetarian. Best long haul flight.
2014-08-03,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 323 AMS-SIN with B777-200ER I had been aware that this is a retrofitted aircraft but surprisingly the aircraft was very well maintained. The seats are very comfortable in economy class the legroom is pretty spacious for me. The lunch service with three options which I have not personally had before and both quantity and quality of meals are at the top level of service. The most important thing about the sector should be the cabin crew they were very attentive. Overall I have been very pleased with the quality given by Singapore Airlines and recommend the airline for long haul flights.
2014-08-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ246 July 7th BNE-SIN. SQ422 8th July BNE-BOM. SQ421 17th July BOM-SIN. SQ255 18th July SIN-BNE. I have been flying with SQ for the last 5 years. They have excellent service staff and crew members and a great on-time performance record! Some aircraft's are a bit old (example: Boeing 777-200ER that flies between SYD and BOM). The screen resolution and quality is quite poor on this aircraft but the crew members are friendly and great to talk to if you don't want to watch movies/TV.
2014-07-29,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-LHR. Outbound leg on the older 777 but the seat was comfortable enough. IFE was also the older system but worked well and the headphones were excellent (after a broken pair was replaced). Crew generally good and attentive although some far better than others and the service was a bit abrupt at times with items being almost snatched away. Inbound flight left SIN at 1.30am dinner served about an hour into the flight then lights out. Used the 'book the cook' service outbound monkfish as excellent return curry a bit hotter than I was expecting but good quality.
2014-07-27,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,July 2014 SIN-MNL-SIN. Seats were OK for both sectors. Leg space for A330 was narrow but MNL-SIN B777-200 retrofitted seats have more space. However B777-200 'new' PTV shrunk and low resolutions. Both sector's in flight meals were disappointing. SQ's meals standard have dropped in the past one year. They should ask their own chef to try out first before sending to cabin.
2014-07-27,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew business class from SIN-MEL overnight on a 777. Very disappointed in the shabby scuffed and old cabin. The seats were narrow (compared to 777-300ER and A380) and did not lie fully flat (this should be standard for a premium airline). I had some emails to send and found that there was no wifi available (again this is offered on their 777-300ER and A380). I wouldn't mind if there was a discount for this plane model but for Singapore Airlines high prices passengers deserve better.
2014-07-20,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,9 July Auckland - Singapore. Seats not comfortable; leg space just about adequate. PTVs small and old. Cabin too warm. In flight meals disappointing. Service was reasonable but could have been better. Disappointing flight all round. Not looking forward to journey home.
2014-07-20,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew SYD-SIN-LHR then reverse. Originally was meant to be A380-B747 outbound then A380 for both legs inbound. This was changed to B777-300 and B747 out and B777-300 in. The B777 was exceedingly cramped with very little leg room. When reclining the seat moves forward further reducing your already limited legroom and when the passenger in front reclines the seat back comes very close to you. Sardines in a can spring to mind. On the return trip because of the change of 'plane outbound I checked on-line and discovered the change so for the second leg SIN- SYD I managed to change my seats to next to emergency door definitely worth paying the extra. As for the seats themselves on the B777 the seats are very hard with not much in the way of cushioning making a bad situation worse. From LHr-SIN the in-flight entertainment was a modern touchscreen unit with an extensive choice but was extremely sensitive and with the closeness of it next to your knees the slightest choice would activate it illuminating your area and your fellow passengers with light not good if wanting to sleep that is if you can sleep in the crowded conditions. From SIN-SYD the unit was an old system with very limited choice and I soon gave up with it. Having flown SIA many times before I was really looking forward to flying with them to experience the (relative) comfort of the A380 yet again. What a disappointment! Previously whenever asked I would say that SIA was my favourite airline but these cost-cutting measures have made me re-evaluate that.
2014-07-17,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled SYD-SIN-ZRH. SYD-SIN on the old (and very full) 777-200. The entertainment system on this leg is awful barely any good movies to watch very limited. Food was fine. Arrived in Singapore early gate to connecting flight just next door too good to be true. They say if it's too good to be true it probably is - the flight to Zurich was delayed 4 hours due to a hydraulic problem with the plane (oil leaking throughout the wing). Although this was extremely frustrating the staff were extremely helpful assisting people who were going to miss their next connecting flights etc. When we finally got on the flight to Zurich (an A380) the staff were great. Food pretty good and entertainment much better. Singapore Airlines always provide excellent service and Changi airport is very easy to navigate.
2014-07-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Redeemed an award flight for the family on NGO-SIN leg on 8 July 2014. Fantastic service as expected of SQ Business Class. IFS switched effortlessly to dialect and Mandarin when speaking to my parents who do not speak English. The crew were professional attentive and friendly. Seats were excellent better than the Asiana Business Class which I took 3 weeks prior. The noise-cancelling headsets given gave me painful ears after a while though. This was the first time I used their headsets as I used to carry my own - room for improvement on that. While everything else worked perfectly the privacy screen was stuck and took a strapping male FA some effort to take out. Food was very good except for dessert where the Chocolate Truffle Cake for dessert was disappointingly dry and hard. We enjoyed both the Japanese and the Western options. Food was served upon being airborne which was about 11am so it was rather early for lunch. When we asked for some fruits for snacks (or anything really) at around 3pm the FA said they did not have any food left and offered us mixed nuts instead. Perhaps SQ should stock up on snack items?
2014-07-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,HND-SIN-CGK on A330-300 and B777-200 (retrofitted) respectively. First leg Tokyo-HND to Singapore-SIN morning flight. Very generous volume and options of food and drinks. I always like the Singapore Sling cocktail by the way. Second leg retrofitted B777-200 from Singapore to Jakarta. Tasty fruit platter and excellent hot towel service as always.
2014-07-17,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,AKL-SIN-LHR-SIN-MEL in Economy using points redemption. Comfortable enough flight on all legs legroom good in economy and service typically robotic and boring. IFE excellent. No issue with inflight as they are definitely good. No recognition whatsoever for status despite my partner spending significant sums with this airline but no surprises there as this is the usual procedure with Singapore Airlines these days. Lounge in Singapore not good. On a long haul flight such as this there are no showering amenities. I realise for Business and First travellers this is available in SilverKris lounge but in KrisFlyer Gold not. The lounge is very basic and as their hub being Changi I had expected more. Food options were lacklustre and overall quite disappointing. The flight itself however couldn't fault and arrived feeling fairly refreshed at either end but their lounges at all destinations where SQ operated are always fairly average. LHR SIN MEL all initially come to mind.
2014-07-17,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Took an Airbus 330 SIN-KIX on 29 June 2014. Flight departed and arrived on time. Service was average - good but not excellent. Perhaps it has to do with the full load. Aircraft was alternating between very cold and very hot throughout the flight. Restrooms were clean IFE working perfectly and food was standard. The major flaw was the seat pitch. Couldn't remember the last time I took SQ's A330 but the seat pitch was way smaller than even ANA Domestic which I took twice during this trip. It was very cramped.
2014-07-13,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ285 from SIN to AKL. Despite a full flight service was good. Flight steward were attended to fulfil my request very soon after the bell was pressed. But disappointed over the ageing aircraft. SQ ticket price definitely not in the lower bracket but the 777-300 cabinet condition and facilities were just too old when comparing to other carriers.
2014-07-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Jakarta - Singapore - Milan July 9-10. Everything fine cabin crew excellent as always. Still my favourite airline.
2014-07-13,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Zurich to Jakarta via Singapore all flights were on time and friendly attentive cabin crew they really give attention to passengers. Seat was very comfortable and the entertainment was great enough for a 12 hour flight but the flight path was not as informative as before. First flight from Zurich to Singapore had horrible seafood menu as I ordered before and the fourth flight from Singapore to Zurich the problem was the entertainment system - we couldn't see the flight path and the audio or video was stuck every few minutes. I did try the Wi-Fi onboard. I think $5.99 for 5 MB was far too expensive and the connection was slow. Other than that every aspect was went very well (check in boarding transit baggage handling).
2014-07-08,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,LAX - Singapore via Tokyo. Entertainment system in the new Airbus A380 was excellent had all new movies. Service was good they had hot towels and many choices of food. The headphones weren't working well I could only hear from one side. Seats were pretty small for a new aircraft but overall satisfying.
2014-07-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 218 from Melbourne to Singapore on a Boeing 777-300ER. Renowned Singapore Girls were friendly and exemplary. A passenger seated next to me spilled her orange juice on my lap and they courteously offered wet towels to me when I requested for them. Food was great and Krisworld was amazing as usual.
2014-07-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew SIA business class Christchurch - Singapore - Istanbul and then London - Singapore - Auckland. Staff service was superb. My only negatives are the smallish TV screens and rather overly warm cabin.
2014-07-06,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew BNE-SIN return in Economy class. All flights departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was modern and clean A330 with nice interior. Seats were not the most comfortable and felt a bit cramped. IFE was very good user friendly. The cabin crew are wonderful very helpful kind and courteous. Food was of high quality however the continental breakfast was a let down. All kinds of amenities were available and snacks provided on request. I did enjoy my trip with Singapore Airlines maybe a tad overrated. I feel other Asian airlines such as KE CX CI are just as good but still one of the best airlines you can fly!
2014-07-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ919 MNL-SIN 24th June 2014. From check-in to deboarding the plane check-in personnel were good. Excellent customer service inflight meals were great. Singapore Airlines Cabin Crew are the best too. Will fly them anytime anywhere.
2014-07-03,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Rome to Singapore SQ 365 on 27 June. We were advised at check-in that there had been a change of aircraft and our hearts sank when we boarded it was an ancient 777 surprised that Singapore Airlines still uses these dinosaurs. I have never experienced such old uncomfortable business class seats (you could select either seat recline or leg raise not both at the same time). I am only 5 ft 4"" and I felt scrunched up. There was no storage around the seat area for personal belongings on this very old plane really not good enough for a five star airline on a long haul route. No mattress over the seats as you get with Qantas and no amenities pack (only slippers and eye shade). The only saving grace were the crew they were exemplary fantastic in fact and the meals were fantastic. If only the aircraft matched the wonderful service on board."
2014-07-03,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,Dubai-Singapore-Perth. Very disappointing. What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly entertainment screen was tiny dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970’s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlins these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.
2014-07-01,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to Auckland SQ281 777-200. Can't believe Singapore still use this aircraft it desperately needs an overhaul tiny 6 inch displays no touch even with full brightness I was struggling switched to using my tablet instead. Seat rests do go fully up. Service was poor this time around Food normally in economy is ok to good this wasn't. Not a nice way to come back to NZ. will consider other options.
2014-07-01,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-JFK over three separate legs. Encountered crews ranging from good to excellent on these flights. Catering was mainly Book the Cook and very good (FRA food is never as good as most other ports). Choice of DOM or Krug and great wine selection. SQ are still close to perfect in first class.
2014-06-25,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,The plane seemed to be extremely old and in need of upgrade. Flight SQ0324 Friday 6th June. In the past I have always praised Singapore Airlines for having more room in Economy than any other airline - I was evidently very wrong and I guess lucky in the past. I had bruises on my leg where I had squeezed out of my seat to go to the bathroom - the passenger in front had reclined his seat and I couldn't get out of my seat easily. Flight was so bad I cancelled my flight home with Singapore (and lost the money) rather than suffer that trip again I flew back to Melbourne with Qatar.
2014-06-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew 30th May London - Singapore - Bali. First leg on the A380 double decker second leg Boeing 777200 series. Return flight 14th June as above but Singapore to London to our disappointment the aircraft was changed to a Boeing 777 300er series much prefer the A380. Cannot fault the service staff very polite did their job well - we were given plenty of drinks during the flight. Seating and legroom good with good choice of entertainment. All flights very punctual.
2014-06-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,7th June SIN-BKK 10th June BKK-SIN. Both were on A330s with on time arrivals. Something seems different with SQ now; The cabin crew now exude character and warmth. They're quick to start a quick conversation with you and go the extra mile to make sure that your flight is comfortable. Definitely heading back to being one of the best airlines in the world. Keep it up Singapore Airlines! Indeed a great way to fly.
2014-06-20,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,DPS-Singapore 28 May 2014. Excellent flight and service. Friendly and efficient staff. B777-200. Singapore - Amsterdam 28 May 2014 B777-200. Although old aircraft again very pleasant and comfortable. Staff very good. Flatbeds - we slept very well. Great flights great airline.
2014-06-20,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I normally take China Airlines for my monthly flight from Surabaya to Singapore. I found that the departure time is nice but the return time is far too early in the morning so my travel agent advised me to use SIA sister company Silk Air for the return. Expecting something special as I'm paying more money I didn't find anything special except the extra amenities. The so called Singapore Ladies/stewardess that are heavily advertised are nothing special. Please prepare to be disappointed.
2014-06-16,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight SQ 308 9th June 2014. The worst business Class seat too wide no support hard as a rock. You can't sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. My back actually aching on arrival. Never again. Food lousy choice too small service without a smile and even then only when you asked. No pyjamas SIN to London and one meal served with no cloth at all. Used to be great. Flying back Emirates and saving $1250 per seat on top.
2014-06-16,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,CGK-SIN SQ 967 / SIN-NRT SQ 638. CGK-SIN with a retrofitted 777-200. It has always been nice that SIA has meal options other than standard meal. I opted for fruit platter and everything was tasty. Smooth take-off and landing arrived SIN on time for connecting flight to Tokyo-NRT. SIN-NRT leg on B777-300ER with brand new interior. Tasty refreshment breakfast superb touch-screen IFE ergonomic seat comfy headrest. Two thumbs up as always!
2014-06-10,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,ICN-SIN-BNE. Both flights very poor service offered by staff if you could find them! ICN-SIN did not see flight attendants for a full hour after take off no offer of any drinks before take off or after. Poor selection of lunch offered - Braised beef with lentils! Staff hid behind curtain no offer of refills during a 5 hour flight. SIN-BNE - FA's were rude midnight flight there was no offer of any snacks during 8 hour flight and made to feel I was an inconvenience when asking for a drink. Breakfast meal (received 6 hours into flight) was rubbish. Have flown Economy with Singapore and it was fine. I thought flying Business Class was going to be an amazing experience -it was just terrible. Rude staff and poor service. Will never fly with them again as it was such a waste (of a lot) of money!
2014-06-10,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-BNE always had a slight fear of flying before this trip! This was by far the best service I have received on an airline. Any long haul flights I make in the future will always be with Singapore.
2014-06-08,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,We flew from LHR - Singapore - Brisbane - Cairns then the same return journey. In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?
2014-05-29,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew SIA (B777-300ER) from Houston to Singapore (return) it was great. However for the first trip I ordered the seafood meal. It was very disappointing. One of the seafood meals (breakfast) was just eggs and a little bacon (it looked like a low calorie meal). On my return trip I opted for regular meals all were satisfactory. I will never order seafood meals from SIA.
2014-05-29,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew on SQ856 SIN-HKG 388 and SQ871 HKG-SIN 772. The A380 was excellent as it's a brand new aircraft with new comfy seats and more legroom. Also the crew provides excellent service for my family. Food was pretty decent but the IFE could be improved. The return leg was an old 777-200ER. The service is as usual the SIA high standards and the interior and seats are well- maintained and not worn out despite being an old aircraft. In overall the entire experience with Singapore Airlines journey was splendid and worth the money will definitely fly the carrier again.

2014-05-25,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,MNL-SIN return with 3 kids. Fantastic airline despite using old equipment (777-200) for the regional route. Kids meals very tasty that even my daughter who is a very picky eater had no problems finishing the generous portions. Specialised headsets for the kids as well as some activity materials too. IFE acceptable and adequate to keep the young ones entertained for the 3 hour flight. Well worth the money.
2014-05-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-MNL-SYD. Our first sector from Sydney to Singapore was good seat comfort was good food was good for economy IFE was average since it wasn't the SIA KrisWorld flagship system. Singapore to Manila was good flight A330 full flight. Security and boarding was slow (typical for Manila bound flights however) however it was SIA's Economy product seen on the A380. Returning back to Sydney the Singapore to Manila leg was on a older B777 aircraft with an old IFE system with loop programming food was good and seat comfort was good. Our final leg to Sydney was on an A380 on the upper deck. The flight wasn't full and the cabin crew during pushback invited us to come downstairs and check out an empty row so we got a row to ourselves and it was a very comfortable trip back to Sydney. IFE was good food was good however a bit disappointed with the continental breakfast which was essentially a fruit and muffin. Service overall was excellent same high standard that Singapore Airlines provides and the flights ran on time some flights arriving earlier than scheduled. Price was great and would definitely recommend SIA to anyone travelling.
2014-05-23,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN - 777-300ER. The flight was ok but the service was amazing! The food was good the seat was good. It was a red-eye flight that was 7hrs and only 1:30hrs of sleep - it took 2:30hrs for dinner and 2hrs for breakfast. I would recommend that Singapore Airlines should do short meal services for red-eye flights.
2014-05-16,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,London to Sydney LHR/SIN on the 777-300ER with new business class and SIN/SYD on the A380-800 with the older business product. The food and service was superb. I used book the cook for both legs lamb chops on the second leg were memorable. Champagne was Bollinger. The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem. I got bulkhead seats for the second leg on the A380. SIA do not offer sleeping suits in business.
2014-05-16,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future."
2014-05-16,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,KUL-Singapore-Dubai and return. The seat were spacious with good storage spaces but a bit dated due wear and tear. Crews were attentive food served was generous and the entertainment selection was good.
2014-05-11,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Excellent carrier everything is excellent. Steward/Stewardess are very polite and when I entered the aircraft I had a sense that everything is going to be excellent. Meals are excellent and captain announcements were very clear and aircraft cabin was new and modern.
2014-05-11,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Quick business trip involving 4 long haul sectors on SQ. AKL-SIN-AMS-CPH-SIN-AKL. First two on 777-300ER and return on 777-200ER. As always fabulous and consistent service and quality all round. SQ is refitting their 777-200ER fleet with decent Business class seats similar to those fitted to the 300's and A380's but they still have 4 or 5 aircraft's not yet done. Unfortunately I got one sector with one of these and they are bad after you've experienced their newer product. If you are unlucky enough to get one of these you probably won't know until you board see the seats and get that sinking feeling! Looking forward to them finishing the job as they appear to be using the old ones to NZ a lot!
2014-05-11,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,Service standards are disappointing. My flight was on SQ 298 from Christchurch to Singapore in general for the price of the ticket I expected much better. Food was very poor. For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets. I would not be flying Singapore Airlines again.
2014-05-10,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew LHR to MNL - to give some context I've done pretty much every route to Manila in recent years usually based on price at the time. I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.
2014-05-08,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN. Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes) I asked at check-in if I could take the later 2230 flight instead of the 2100 I was booked on so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it’s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it’s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone. I will manage my sleep patterns better and ask for some spicy sauce on the side of my main next time but SQ remain one of the best in the air.
2014-05-08,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,In the last 2 weeks I flew from Perth to Singapore to Johannesburg back to Singapore then to Hong Kong from Hong Kong back to Singapore and finally home to Perth! All with Singapore Airlines. Every flight was quite simply the best I have experienced. I actually found myself looking forward to a meal on a plane. All aspects were fast efficient friendly and professional. Economy seats on the 777 are far better than any other airline I have flown IFE was very good with a wide selection all flights on time and onboard staff very good. Quite simply I can see why they are always rated so highly.
2014-05-07,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ222 SYD to SIN on Airbus 380 punctual take-off excellent in-flight service great seat cabin crews were very friendly and attentive. Singapore Airlines is a class above others!
2014-05-07,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,We have been Silver Krisflyer members for 15 years at least and just flew Johannesburg to Singapore SQ479 26 Apr and Singapore to Brisbane SQ235 27 Apr and the disinterested and offhand manner of the staff was very noticeable. The females with one exception were unsmiling and almost snatched trays from us. During meal service flight attendants in the past always ensured the comfort of passenger dining by requesting the seats be upright but on these two flights I had to ask that this be done. Also there was a huge rush to get a stone cold awful breakfast served before landing in Brisbane - why? Then they missed the fact that a passenger in front still had his seat reclined for landing. We noticed similar problems on a return Europe flight last year.
2014-05-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore Changi to Guangzhou Baiyun return. Stewardess were attentive and polite. Hot towel upon arrival. Food was excellent. Seats were comfortable. Good serving time and the drinks were great. Power sockets were found on the seats great for my laptop! Something that I have not seen on my previous trip to Taiwan with the local airlines there. Everything was taken care off and you know that you are in good hands.
2014-05-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Left Heathrow on 21st February stopping in Singapore for 1.5 hours before flight to Auckland. I had the pleasure of flying for the first time not only to New Zealand from Heathrow but with Singapore Airlines. I just had to write to say how excellent my flying time was. I was made to feel safe secure welcome and as if I was the only passenger on the plane. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were immaculate in all areas of appearance. A great flight.
2014-04-30,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to San Francisco on 26 April 2014 which was a full flight. Before take off it seemed that some passengers were not assigned seats but the ground and cabin crew were on top of sorting things out. Food from Singapore to Hong Kong was pretty good but the food from Hong Kong to San Francisco was quite disappointing.
2014-04-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight 25 April 19 2014 and Flight 26 on April 27 2014. My wife and I have flown Singapore Airlines before and have always been more than satisfied with every aspect of the flight. This trip was even better than in the past. The crew on both flights were exceptionally helpful since my wife had hip surgery recently and needed extra attention. We were accommodated at every turn during the flight. The American carriers could learn a lot from Singapore Airlines.
2014-04-28,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,We are long time Kris flyers our flights SQ 224 and SQ 866 7 April 2014 Perth - Singapore Singapore - Hong Kong there were no problems as was SQ 805 22 April 2014. Beijing - Singapore however SQ 223 25 April 2014 Singapore - Perth what a shambles full flight cabin staff were more interested in 'special meals etc'. Eventually after a 1.5 hour delay we were served lunch you read about staff not answering call button this happened to us eventually our call was answered there was definitely a problem. No coffee and tea was brought around eventually my husband took our meal trays down to the back galley only to be met with oh! We forgot! On leaving the aircraft - there was not one cabin crew member to be seen.
2014-04-27,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled Denpasar (Bali) to Singapore on SQ 943. This was a great flight. Gracious and charming service on a 7 year old 777-200 in the old configuration with comfy armchair style recliners. Delicious beef steak with great red wine and champagne. The cabin crew were professional and friendly. The IFE was very old fashioned but that was the only demerit otherwise excellent.
2014-04-27,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ-011 Tokyo NRT to Singapore SIN on Airbus A380-800. Almost all seats on the economy class were occupied but FAs stayed professional and smart. Effective F&B services clean cabin good amenities acceptable IFE options. Two thumbs-up for SIA as always.
2014-04-27,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,"I am a Kris Flyer ""Silver Elite"" member and I have recently travelled the Suites from Hong Kong to Singapore. I enjoyed every moment of the flight. A nice glass of bubbles (Dom Perignon) was offered before take off. The cabin crews were very attentive and helpful on every aspect of my flight. The food was more than adequate for me. A nice touch when a head cabin service officer apologized to me about the delay when the flight took off behind schedule from HKG was due to late arrival to HKG from Singapore. I'll recommend this airline."
2014-04-27,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I have been on many business class trips all lovely but Singapore Airlines tops them all. Their cabin crew are friendly and always smiling the meals were excellent the seat was huge and IFE was excellent. The lounge in Singapore was the best I have been in. For the 25 hours it took to get from Sydney to Paris I enjoyed every second what I liked the most was the express passes at Sydney International Airport skipping the queue at customs. I don't usually fly on business trips with the kids but they loved it too!
2014-04-27,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew with family ICN-SIN-DPS and back. Food was very tasty (for economy standard). Entertainment selection is very extensive. Cabin crew service and safety attitude is above standard. All flights were on time.
2014-04-23,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to London Heathrow on 17th April 2014 at 11.30pm. The best seats on any airline would be in a child free cabin having just returned on another flight having to endure 13 hours listening to a screaming child I think all airlines should ensure children/infants are in a separate cabin.
2014-04-23,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I am a fairly new traveller with Singapore with 7 trips in 2014 usually from Singapore to and from my homeland India or my office in Germany. Today returned from my short Easter vacation with a round trip Pune-Mumbai- Singapore in Business class on 421 and 422. Spacious seats with extendable leg space for sleeping. Excellent Service - offered blankets and head rest within minutes. They serve the best inflight fresh food. You must not miss their 'Book the Cook' option and their speciality is the delicious Lobster Thermidor. Staff pronounced my difficult name correctly and the stewardess offered to fill in my landing visa form my luggage was already towed in advance to my waiting car so I wont have to wait at the terminal after my flight.
2014-04-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 321-31/3/14 SQ 297- 1/4/14 SQ 298 - 17/4/14 SQ 308 - 18/4/14. Just returned from a trip to New Zealand and was very impressed with the level of service and efficiency. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Singapore Airline again or in recommending them to others.
2014-04-19,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight 305 1/3/14. I have flown with them before but quite few years ago so assumed they would of gone downhill like so many airlines but what a pleasant surprise nothing had changed! Great service from the cabin crew comfortable seating really nice food and best of all a brilliant IFE system. I have flown with Cathay Pacific and Malaysian a lot and they are good but no where near the same class as Singapore.
2014-04-16,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,This is my second time travelling with SQ. This time it was HKG-LHR with a transit in Singapore (SQ856 and SQ306). The trip was excellent in all respects especially the catering and the seat which has footrests unlike CX (which I found to be much needed on 13 hour flights). However the transit in Changi was confusing as it is against convention in the way that arrivals and departures are in the same area and I was trying to find somewhere to go through immigration again which turns out to be at the gate itself. Also the A380's on both trips had a good variety in their IFE despite not being touch screen because the remote controller was not always responsive. I loved the rear economy section on the upper deck of the A380 it was cosy and small meaning less noise and less people knocking against you when you are trying to go to the galley or bathroom. The purser was great trying desperately to look for the other meal option from the downstairs cabin after it ran out on the upper deck. In a nutshell a well deserved 5 star airline and something that is a class above Emirates.
2014-04-15,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Just completed a return trip BKK-IST in biz class on 777-200 retro fitted. What a great way to fly! Service was excellent got addressed by name on all 4 sectors and food was generally high standard overall. We tried the 'Book the Cook' Service and ordered their famous Lobster Thermidor. It was very good. The waffles unfortunately were terrible. The seat itself is very wide and not too bad for sleeping if you sleep diagonally. It was my first time in the seats and I didn't realise that the seat back didn't go back flat the full width of the seat. Perhaps the only disappointing thing would be the KrisWorld Entertainment System - it wasn't as extensive in selection of movies as say Cathay Pacific. The lounges were very good especially the Turkish Airlines one in Istanbul - incredible!!! This was a FF Points trip -if only we could afford to fly like this all the time.
2014-04-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I travelled using Singapore Airlines on the weekend returning from Phuket and I must say I am nothing but impressed. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly the plane itself was comfortable having ample room to stretch out (with two children that can be a bit hard). The flight was smooth and comfortable. I would highly recommend using them I have used them previously and have always been happy with their service.
2014-04-11,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on a Boeing 777-300ER. Entertainment options available were aplenty. Excellent service from the cabin crew. Who knew this tiny little country could produce one of the world's best airlines. Can't wait to fly with them again soon!
2014-04-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Manchester UK - Munich - Singapore - Brisbane and same for return. Very friendly crew very welcoming and helpful. Hot towels before take off nice food and a good range of snacks available at any time. Good range of TV programmes and films that keep you entertained. Blankets socks and headphones provided on each flight. Seats not particularly big with only slightly more leg room than a short haul flight but still fairly comfortable. Always on time with no problems/delays. Overall a great airline with a great service! Would definitely recommend.
2014-04-07,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-SIN-BKK return. SQ232 and 231 on A380 and SIN/BKK sectors on A330. Having flown with the rest I have now again flown with the best. Return flight SIN to SYD not full - was seated upstairs and upon request was granted exit row seats without fuss. Everything about these flights was near perfect and yet the fares paid were no different from the other airlines. Most pleasant relaxing flights with nothing more needing reporting. Definitely a cut above the rest.
2014-04-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,BKK-SIN 25th March. After having to endure a flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok with SAS Scandinavian Airlines the Singapore flight was like ascending from hell to heaven. The contrast could not have been greater. Wonderful service great food and excellent entertainment. Singapore Airlines really care about their customers and it shows. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommended.
2014-04-06,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-AKL 28th March. Very nice smooth flight. A printed menu good food a great entertainment system. The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft but never mind at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others such as Air New Zealand do. (In my opinion there should be some international law that forbids this practice because the cramped isle compromises safety.) The service and entertainment made up for the lack of space so I would still rate it as a 5 star experience.
2014-04-02,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-DXB-SIN. Both were on the B777-300ER series. Adequate legroom and good IFE to keep me entertained throughout the flight. As usual the service was up to standard professional and efficient but Singapore Airlines service tends to lag the warmth and personable service despite being efficient and professional. That being said a worthwhile flight on both leg under Singapore Airlines and I will recommend to choose Singapore Airline compared to Emirates for this route.
2014-03-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-SYD and return. A380 for the first and third legs B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble which is trivial is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.
2014-03-30,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ942 from Singapore to Denpasar: service was friendly food was good - had no problems with the flight. SQ943 from Denpasar to Singapore: service was cold they had only one meal option left by the time they got to me (thankfully it tasted good). Wondering if SQ has done away with the kids' activity packs because my kids were not given any and I had to ask for the kid-sized headphones for them on both legs.
2014-03-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,We recently travelled business class return to Auckland via Singapore. We used both the 777 and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed an excellent choice of food and wines and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines but they are well worth the money. They will always be my airline of choice!
2014-03-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"The best business class I've experienced. JFK to FRA on an A380. Luxury product with Givenchy amenities: blanket pillows table linens cutlery tableware etc. Food of very good quality ordered one of the ""Book the Chef"" options impressive beverage selection with a large list of cocktails as a plus! The crew is the key here simply one of the best in-flight experiences ever! They know their product and how to enhance it! Always adressed me with my last name and always with a genuine smile."
2014-03-28,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Anticipating a good experience on this well reputed airline I was not at all disappointed. Flying A380 on LAX- NRT-SIN route the service was consistently good attentive several menu items and literary numerous (more than 400 movies alone) entertainment options; the only discomfort was the temperature somehow SQ insisted on keeping the cabin quite cold. But overall great service and experience.
2014-03-28,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I've been travelling with SA for many years each year a trip from UK to Australia via Singapore some years 2 trips. In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty. (I look respectable honestly!).
2014-03-26,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,I've just come back from a UK - Perth return trip. I first used them two years ago when I went UK - Auckland return and at that time I could not fault them in anyway this time my experience was different. The food was awful I'm not a person that's fussy about food but every meal was awful. The staff as always were great but you have to ask for everything now that's not standard such as a beer! Don't get me wrong they will get you one but you have to ask before they would ask you. The pillows were dirty god knows with what but you wouldn't put your head on one. I cant put my finger on it but the planes all four were tired. Maybe just a case that they are cutting back the same as everyone else but to me there's no excuse for such poor meals. 3 of us travelled and all of us thought the same.
2014-03-19,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ912 SIN-MNL 13/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVG. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins. There was a delay in moving off but captain kept passengers well informed. Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. Fortunately the flight was only 70% full and I switched to the 2nd seat. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.
2014-03-19,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ919 MNL-SIN 18/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVJ. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins or so. Took off earlier than schedule which was great. Service was good as usual. Crew seem tired since I didn't see any crew change taking place. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was great. Had a choice between pork with BBQ flavoured rice and chicken with pasta. I had the pork while my companion had the chicken. My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good though portions are minuscule. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens fortunately still AVOD. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard 32 inches. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. The flight was full. I tried asking for souvenirs and was given postcards and playing cards with a smile this time. In conclusion this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.
2014-03-19,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Brisbane to Singapore on 14th March sitting in row 57. The service was first class the flight supervisor remembering details of passengers and while remaining professional communicated with a sense of humour and friendliness. The food was as good as any restaurant with good size portions. Inflight entertainment was first class plenty of choice for everyone to keep occupied.
2014-03-17,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,We have just returned from Asia and this was the first time we had flown with Singapore airlines. Having contacted their customer services before our flight I have to say the service was excellent. We travelled on a A380 airbus and we sat upstairs. Comfort leg room food and service during our flight were better than we have experienced with any other airline. We travelled to Bangkok via Singapore and our return was from Hanoi via Singapore. We sat in 78ac and 72 ac on our return. The service was excellent. Our luggage was transferred to our final destination. All staff on the flight were kind helpful and made the journey a pleasure. Well done Singapore Airlines we would definitely fly with them again.
2014-03-17,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ175 HAN-SIN on March 9 2014 seat 16D Airbus A330 300. Pros: nice food and wine very good entertainment and service. Cons: although seat is indicated full flat it is not possible for aircraft designed for short distance. Relatively low choice of magazines no menu for food they only show it to you very briefly. Very small overhead locker even my specially designed cabin luggage would not fit into any locker of the ATR 72. Slightly chaotic situation if you change seats at check-in.
2014-03-14,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Manchester to Sydney via Munich and Singapore and then same route on return. I had heard positive things about Singapore Airlines but to be honest I was quite disappointed. The service was better than rival airlines but was not fantastic. At least they did offer drinks at frequent intervals. The seats were uncomfortable and the cabin temperature was cold. On the outgoing Singapore/Sydney sector it was really far too cold. The food was absolutely awful. I ordered a vegetarian meal and except for the meal out of Sydney it was virtually inedible. If you have a nut allergy don't fly with this airline as packets of nuts are given out freely. I'm not sure if I would fly with SA again.
2014-03-12,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Outbound and return flight from Singapore to Taipei in economy class. Flights were seriously delayed both ways without giving passengers due prior notification. On the outbound leg in Singapore we sat in the plane for about 2 hours before we could take off. On-board service was so-so and the food was virtually inedible. No wonder everyone seemed to have ordered a special meal.
2014-03-10,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,A380 LHR to SIN ok seats less comfortable than original seating plan. Inflight entertainment faulty but viewable. Boeing 777-200 to Christchurch on tired and dated planes. Terrible seats and 17 inch. Return journey no inflight entertainment for >40 seats from take off. After 9 hours rebooted system as IFE had now gone down in business also. Poor that it was now clear the problem could have been solved sooner if they were at all bothered. Terrible customer service. Boeing 777-300 new touch screens but the plane noise is so loud almost impossible to hear the movies when sat just behind wing. No snacks offered during 13 hour flight. Not recommended.
2014-03-06,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to Zurich on A380 - overall good. Good selection of food option flight had some turbulence. Frankfurt to Singapore on A380. Again good selection of food options and flight had no turbulence.
2014-03-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN - return. Another great flight with Singapore Airlines on A380. The crew were all friendly and served drinks throughout the flight. My vegetarian special meals were tasty - one of the best I have had. Good choice of programs on TV.
2014-03-03,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Economy Class from Surabaya to Singapore on Feb 23. SQ operates A330 on this route. Seating arrangement is 2x4x2. We were given the middle section (4 seats) as we traveled with one child and one infant. The seats were comfortable enough with generous leg room. Food was not as tasty as Silk Air and only one option left at that time when the FA served me. Very disappointing! All in all still unhappy with the SIA in-flight services I personally think the services are going downhill.
2014-03-03,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from LHR-SIN on 18th Feb 2014 the majority of the crews on flight were outstanding except for one male crew who was a bit rude when I asked for a cup of noodles the initial response was that they didn't have anymore stock and breakfast would be served soon. Apart from this I was still satisfied with the staff service food and inflight entertainment.
2014-02-27,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR to SIN on 15th Feb returning on 26th both legs on 777-200ER. Both legs with window seats. Staff and service excellent food (Asian option) choices excellent and delicious. Plentiful water juice and hot drinks between meals as well as light bites. Hot towels before each meal. IFE selection gargantuan with superb easy to use handset. Seats outbound far more comfortable than on the return sector. For service and inflight experiences one of the nicest I have enjoyed definitely the carrier of choice to South East Asia and Changi airport is a thing of beauty.
2014-02-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ318 SIN to LHR 23 Feb A380-800 Business Class. Excellent flight in every respect. On time. Excellent service throughout. Top quality food and drink. The seat and bed were both extremely comfortable. Having flown out on Boeing 777 300 ER (see separate earlier report) with the compromised and uncomfortable new business class seat / bed I was surprised how much more comfortable the older seat / bed arrangement is on the A380. The only aspect that is not superior on the A380 is the screen which is larger and sharper on the 777 with the new business class. This was an excellent flight and I now know to try to pick Singapore flights with the A380 and to avoid the 777.
2014-02-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew on 22/2/14 from Brisbane to Singapore then onwards to Heathrow. The first flight was on a new A330-300 the second on an almost as new Boeing 777-300 ER. Both flights were just superb. The cabin crew as ever were attentive friendly and professional. The food on both flights was very good even though we were in cattle class. We have used them many times to Australia and they are always excellent.
2014-02-24,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore-London on a B777. Flight was on time and the plane looked very clean the food was great and not many passengers in business class. FAs were very attentive and they were fast. I will fly with them again.
2014-02-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Milan-Singapore-Chiang Mai and return Singapore Airlines + Silk Air aircraft. Costly ticket (worth 1000 EUR instead of 700/800 EUR of competitors') but you get uncrowded cabins and premium feeling both on-board and at S'pore airport. Gulf carriers cabin crew should really take classes from Singapore Airlines' staff!
2014-02-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-NGO A330 J. Two perfect flights. Very comfortable seats. Fantastic crew who didn't forget a thing Bollinger champagne terrific meals (my Indian lamb shank ordered via Book The Cook was the best dish I have had on a plane). Comfortable spacious cabin plenty of overhead bin space addressed by name more movies than I could get through. Flights departed and arrived on time Changi a very easy airport to transit through. It was very clear why Singapore Airlines remains one of the very best airlines in the world.
2014-02-19,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ469 Colombo to Singapore on Feb 10th. Back with them after almost 4 years I had again a positive experience despite the terrible schedule out of CMB (leaving at 1.30am): brand new A330-300 great and attentive crew and entertainment system displayed on a big PTV. During my previous experience with them I remember the seats were more comfortable and softer on their B777 but the legroom is still far above average for economy and service outstanding. Arrival to Changi on time and out of the terminal in less than half an hour really a fantastic airport in terms of facilities and organization.
2014-02-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Singapore Airlines to Yangon Myanmar return. Excellent flights - all on time. Service and leg room very good. Prefer the aircraft with the 2 seat row on the side as you don't feel so packed in. Meals were good.
2014-02-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Recently I traveled on B777-200ER from Mumbai to Singapore. It was a very comfortable flight. The Economy Class seats are quite comfortable with good in-flight entertainment system but yes some improvements in the system are required. The lavatories of B777-200 are way too small. It feels claustrophobic sometimes and has no window. Crew were very helpful and responsive. Overall a good option to travel long haul.
2014-02-10,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Recently travelled from London Heathrow to Singapore then Singapore to Brisbane. Travelled alone first time. Staff were absolutely wonderful on board polite and attentive. Very comfortable and food very good. Check in outstanding no wait or delays at any point even collecting cases very quick. I would highly recommend these airlines to everyone travelling long haul.
2014-02-07,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ319 from LHR to SIN on the 777 300ER with new business class. Generally a good flight with excellent service good food and fantastic entertainment. The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing. Other than the poor bed / seat and lack of an amenity kit a good flight.
2014-02-05,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,Recently returned from Melbourne via Singapore. The seat on the trip from Singapore to Manchester was really uncomfortable as a result I have a bruised coccyx which is still painful. The stop in Munich is a complete pain and makes for a horrendous journey time about 16 hours. Would think twice before booking with Singapore again.
2014-02-05,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,HKG-SIN-KUL. Older plane a bit dirty. IFE on the blink. Need to get newer planes for these flight segments. Staff experience was great without complaints. Used FF but difficult to get seats and the airline surcharges were high paying like a coach seat. Had to use all FF as they were expiring and not renewable.
2014-02-03,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-MEL in January 2014 in Economy Class. Seats 39 (Aisle) on way up 34 (aisle) on return leg. 747-300 MEL- SIN the 380 on the SIN-MEL leg. Check in for this flight was very slow the flight was as a consequence 30 minutes late leaving with no apology for the delay. The plane on the way to Singapore (the refitted 747) was much more comfortable in my view than the A380. The refitted 747 is not as wide as the 380 the seats seemed to be more comfortable and certainly had better lumbar support. The service was faultless on the way up. The beverage service quite prompt and the inflight meal looked OK. A further snack was served about 1.5 hours prior to landing. The red-eye flight on the way back to Melbourne on the A380 was OK but not great. However the flight left on time the meals and beverage service was efficient and the meal was adequate if nothing special. The seat however was not comfortable - not enough lumbar support and I had back ache for some days afterwards. The blanket provided was of good quality and nice and warm. The crew were efficient as is usual for Singapore Airlines but not very friendly. One of the toilets in the economy cabin was made unavailable for passengers with no explanation as to why. Information given out by 2 crew members about the flight wasn't accurate - they said the arrival time would be 30 minutes earlier than the actual arrival time but in the end we landed on time. However we were kept waiting once we landed and had to stay on the plane at Melbourne airport. Very frustrating after a long flight. However overall having flown with a number of airlines Singapore Airlines is definitely probably one of the better ones. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew are relatively on the ball. There are loads of choices for in-flight entertainment although I wish they would make the headphones more user-friendly and comfortable to wear - after about a couple of hours they hurt my ears and I could not make them short enough to fit comfortably at all. The service is very efficient and the planes are pretty comfortable although I would not recommend the A380 for a long night flight.
2014-02-03,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Just returned from trip to UK via Manchester (from Melbourne) had ordered (and phoned prior to trip) to order special meals as have a sugar allergy. Very disappointed as the meals were hopeless. Offered me fruit coleslaw sugar-free jelly (inedible) all unsuitable. Am so disappointed that in this day and age that either a nutritionist or dietician does not oversee these 'special meals'. The cabin crew were very kind and did their best but it was woefully inadequate and on this basis am unlikely to travel this airline again.
2014-01-30,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I was a passenger on 4 flights between December and end of January 2014. Johannesburg to Singapore was good with excellent staff service and 5 star service for everything. Singapore to Adelaide the staff were less attentive. Adelaide to Singapore my return was again 5 star service. The cabin crew were visible the whole time. Singapore to Johannesburg was not a good flight. My screen did not work properly my headset was not working and as a diabetic traveller the lack of food service was panic stations for myself. As we left at 2.10 in the morning a filled bread roll for the entire flight back does not suffice. I explained to the staff that I needed to have something to eat and was afforded a small bread roll and an apple. Snacks were available but they do not take the place of a meal for passengers. Meals are necessary for diabetics and they cannot travel on snacks for 8 hours especially as the inbound flight would have also just served a snack prior to landing.
2014-01-28,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,MLE-SIN SIN-PER on A330-300. Flight was Male to Singapore was on a fairly dated aircraft. There were dirt and scuff marks across most of the surfaces which detracted from the feeling of luxury! Good service though and food and meals were of a high standard. Singapore to Perth flight was a much newer and cleaner aircraft with fantastic staff. This flight would be a 10/10 and by comparison the flight from Male was lacking in the service area. Seat was quite difficult to sleep on as angled seats are used.
2014-01-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Great flight all round! I flew SYD-SIN and really enjoyed my flight on Singapore's A380. The inflight entertainment was great with all the latest movies and TV shows. I was lucky enough to be sitting on the upper deck which offers more cabin space. The food was great and had a good variety of Western and Asian food. The seats were comfortable and had an ok recline. The cabin attendants were friendly and always had a smile!
2014-01-24,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Frankfurt to Singapore Singapore to Beijing. Semi-traditional Christmas Day dinner option decorations in cabin festive music and the best flight attendants. My airline of choice for long haul because nothing was a problem for them.
2014-01-23,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Excellent trip in Boeing 777-200. Flight delayed 45 Minutes. Request for certain seat was accommodated and the flight was only half full resulting in several empty seats given options for sleep. Service good and 2-3 hot meals were served (dinner hot snacks breakfast). Staff hard working and professional. A true 5 star airline with a genuine economy class product.
2014-01-22,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Paris CDG-SIN-SYD. First leg was on the A380 and we were seated in exit row seats on the upper deck. Much quieter and nicer than downstairs. The attendants were great food pretty good and as it was a long flight there were trays of drinks and snacks available at the back - you could just help yourself. Flight left about 30 mins late but still arrived in SIN on time. Second leg from SIN-SYD was on an older 777. Seats nowhere near as comfortable very few movies on an old entertainment system. The attendants on this leg weren't as good either they just didn't seem interested in helping compared to the other leg. So the first flight was wonderful the second one not so much. Singapore Airlines is still very good and recommend it.
2014-01-15,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Manchester-Singapore-Sydney return. Brilliant service good food for economy class. Flight attendants worked hard and were first class. On the outward journey suggested we might want to move to have more space sadly the plane was packed coming back. We will use them again.
2014-01-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,HND-SIN-JNB-SIN-NRT. Took off late from HND in an A330 due to aircraft arrival. Cabin crew did a good job. No amenity kits distributed. Seat had a lot of space and IFE was loaded with good selections. Had the Japanese style breakfast which was good. Later served refreshment (had a choice) which was nice. I had the Spaghetti and Eggplant really good. Cabin crew made continuous drink runs. A330 had dirty seats that needed cleaning or replacement but a good flight. Took off late from SIN in a revamped 777-200. Lots of space and legroom. Amenity kits distributed. Refreshment was a sandwich and I fell asleep after eating. Had the Omelette for Breakfast. Really good. IFE was not loaded up. Arrived early into JNB. Ground staff at JNB really nice and friendly for being 0605 in the morning. JNB-SIN took off on time. Full flight and again in a revamped 777-200. Amenity kits distributed. Served lunch after an hour. I had the braised pork which was really good. Fell asleep but was awakened by the constant snack runs of sandwiches which were small but very tasty. Constant wine refills were also done. Fruit cookies and chips were also distributed as snacks. For Breakfast asked for chicken but was served the Omelette with sausage. No complaints as it was perfect! Arrived into SIN early. SIN-NRT gate said closed but they were letting pax check in. Seemed like boarding took forever. Took off on time in A380. Seat was cramped and smaller than 777-200 and A330 seats. Served lunch I had the Japanese selection it was ok. Fell asleep and was occasionally awakened to cabin crew doing drink runs. Aircraft seemed to be really cold. Landed in NRT early. With all the late UA flights arriving Immigration was a nightmare! The last flight seemed to be a little low on standards but overall Singapore Airlines is still right up there next to ANA.
2014-01-13,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,London to Singapore Singapore to Sydney 5th January 2014. We had our dates mixed up and turned up to the airport for the wrong flight a day late. This was our fault and Singapore Airlines were very helpful and managed to put us on the next flight (the one we wrongly turned up for). We were not charged anything for this and the ground staff were very professional and helpful. The flight were good seats were as comfortable as economy gets and the entertainment was excellent. The cabin crew were polite and very professional. The food was really good. Because we were headed all the way to Sydney we had to try and get on another flight at Singapore. Once again the ground staff were helpful and professional and put us on the next flight to Sydney at no additional cost. The second flight was as good as the first with comfortable seating great entertainment and service and good food. All round very pleased with Singapore Airlines and grateful!
2014-01-13,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew economy from LA to SIN in May 2013. The seat is spacious and provides enough legroom. However I was utterly disappointed with the service. I fell asleep when they were handing out the meals. I woke up when all the passengers were just about to dig in and I immediately asked for my meal. But I was told that they had run out of lunch and the rude air stewardess walked away without offering anything else. Aren't they supposed to have enough meals for everyone? Even though the air stewardess offered 2 small bags of chips later this still did not make up for it. Light snacks for main meal? I don't think so.
2014-01-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,CGK-SIN-DEL SQ 967 and SQ 406. Connection time more than sufficient. The seat was comfortable but not fully flat. The meal choices I had on the CGK-SIN Route were Rendang and Lasagne. I tried the Rendang and it was delicious soft tender and quite spicy. The TV was sufficient and I'm thankful they have charging port on the SQ 406. I slept for the rest of the flight and managed to do some last minute inflight shopping before landing.
2014-01-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Auckland to Singapore to Mumbai return. Excellent service by cabin crew B777-300ER from AKL to SIN. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was excellent. I had pre arranged a special meal that was delicious. At Singapore airport ground staff member was waiting to guide passengers to Mumbai as it was a fast connection. Singapore to Mumbai was B777-200 - another nice flight.
2014-01-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SGN-SIN-SYD on 9th January 2014. First leg on B770-200. Excellent and proactive ambitious and diligent staff whether old or young. Seats not lie flat but no need for a two hours ride. Lounge access food and drinks very good. 3-4 options for hot food given! The Bollinger champagne is now replaced. No cheese table could be offered. No wifi available. SIN-SYD on A380-800. The cabins provide some privacy. Beds are flat but not fully horizontal a small angle of 3-4% remains disturb sleeping and annoys. The TV screens are heavily light reflecting and are more mirrors than TVs – what a disaster as compared to the investment. The tray tables are in a funny skew position forcing the gourmand to lean sideways while eating. Disappointed by this seat furthermore its hard to operate. Food is excellent and options are plenty. No cheese table offered. No wifi available. FAs were kind caring and attentive. SQ is the only airline serving stout beer - quite charming. Wines are good and food is good as well.
2014-01-09,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Dec 26 Shangahi Pudong-Singapore-Auckland with brand new B777-300ER very efficient check-in and pleasant transit experience comfortable seat with spacious legroom large AVOD screen with plenty of movies/tv shows/music channels. Cabin crew very friendly and polite lots food and very tasty beverages/snacks/fruit served frequently during the mid-might flight of Singapore-Auckland. Return flight Christchurch-Singapore-Shanghai Pudong with old and dated B777-200 can't believe SG still use this type of aircraft for 10hrs flight mini VOD screen is like a joke again outstanding cabin crew and food service.
2014-01-09,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew economy from Frankfurt to Singapore. Food was decent leg space sufficient. A very smooth flight with good customer service. Our flight out of Frankfurt was delayed due to bad weather in New York missed our connecting flight from Singapore to Perth as a result. We were very impressed with their service in this situation. They organised a room and paid a return taxi fare to the very nice Hotel Village Changi. We spent most of our 10 hour wait there eating the free buffet meals and resting in the comfortable room. Although we were frustrated that we were so severely delayed having a hotel room and meals provided made the situation less stressful.
2014-01-08,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN Business in December. I was surprisingly disappointed on this trip aboard their 777-300ER aircraft. Granted the newer Business class was not yet installed but overall I wasn't all that impressed with the quality of the seat which looked rather tired. The lounge in Melbourne is barely comparable to a domestic Virgin Australia lounge since they have split it into Business/First and had a very poor food and beverage offering. Despite requesting not to be woken for breakfast service during the flight to maximise sleep I was. Not a picky traveler and not a regular Business traveler either but found myself a little disappointed at the offering considering the hype.
2014-01-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flying Dubai to Penang via Singapore. Excellent service excellent food not too much expensive great flight entertainment selection. Flight from Singapore to Penang was operated by Silkair with an excellent service. Great airline overall. Definitely using this again.
2014-01-06,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 345 ZRH to SIN 9 Dec 2013. The A380 was late due to non communicated reasons - no Economy Class in Upper Deck were available thus our long lasting reservations were cancelled and we got rather poor seats in the aft of the airplane. The meal was 'overcooked' thus not edible service was non-existent we had to get our drinks ourselves in the galley.¨It was the lousiest flight to Asia we have experienced.
2014-01-03,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flew from Singapore to Dubai in Economy class and I hate the seat configuration. Its 3-4-3 which doesn't give you any privacy if you're travelling with a partner. There are few ""couple seats"" but unfortunately all were booked a month before departure. The seats were quite cramped. No power outlet to charge you mobile phones. The food that was served was the worst airline meal ever had. Totally bland and overcooked chicken. Cheap ice creams. Crew were monotonous and especially one of them who went around asking ""would you like to have a coffee or tea"" non-stop. it took forever for the crew to finish their meal service which resulted in longer time to serve coffee and tray collections. Never flying on a SIA flight again."
2014-01-02,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,23 Dec 2013 SQ638 seated row 73. Singapore to Tokyo - red eye flight was bumpy and hard to sleep. At row 73 we could hear the noise of toilet flushing which made it harder to sleep. Cabin service included snack and drink after take off and breakfast 2 hrs before landing were excellent. 31 Dec 2013 SQ 637 seated row 79. Tokyo to Singapore - Full flight food delicious and service even other airlines talked about. Cabin crew smiled all the time.
2013-12-29,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,18th December from Brisbane to Singapore. I have been taking varied airlines such as Qantas Emirates for this same route over the years. I have to say that I am quite disappointed with the service and that there has indeed been a decline in SIA's standards in this area. I ordered a special vegetarian oriental meal whilst checking in online. As it was served first our drink orders were not taken. My vegetarian meal came with only a piece of bread and the main meal. It was extremely oily and I had no salad or fruit to go with it. I was also refused a dessert as I was told special meals had their own desserts. I never received anything. I was also never served a drink until I asked the stewardess clearing the trays if I could get one. Even then she said she would get back to me and never did. I also tried to do some inflight shopping but the airline had extremely limited stock of the products in the catalogue. Most of the products were not in stock at all. I think compared to the competitors for this same leg SIA is definitely below average. I would think twice before paying this much when I can get a cheaper flight with better service.
2013-12-29,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ976 to Bangkok from Singapore: okay service on 20 December. SQ981 came back to Singapore from Bangkok: much better service. They left the light on for my father who was reading staff were much friendlier and were happy to serve. Both flights on A330 in-flight entertainment had lots of selection.
2013-12-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-HK-SIN on A380. SQ866 and 865 Singapore to Hong Kong departed on time and FA were friendly and attentive to our needs and always smiled. Kris-world was excellent with a wide range of movies including recently release new movies for our entertainment. It's only a 4 hrs flight but to have an IFE onboard made it such a wonderful experience to enjoy your 4hrs. Meals were good and ice cream was given for the first leg return leg had a new selection of movies which I always enjoyed having. And the best thing was they had a Christmas menu and it was excellent with turkey and log cakes. Delayed arrival entering Singapore due to heavy traffic and captain informed us of the delay. Overall a wonderful experience and SQ has kept its high standards in service and quality once again.
2013-12-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I travelled from Singapore to Kolkata and back during the month of December and I have to say that the service is far better than any other carrier. During the night flight back to Singapore passengers were given Givenchy amenity kits. The food was also very nice and tasty and we were given a menu card before departure which I felt was a nice touch. The last thing I wish to highlight is that the inflight entertainment Krisworld was excellent and all the latest blockbusters were available onboard. I was totally spoilt for choice during the short 3 hour 50 minutes flight. Strongly recommended to everyone.
2013-12-25,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-FCO-SIN on SQ366/365. The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.
2013-12-23,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR to SIN 10th Dec. Business class flight on the A380. After use of lounge boarded plane easily and was directed to my seat by FA. Offered drinks went for Champagne and also asked about post take off drinks. Offered papers and magazines for the journey. Seat very comfy and although a night flight did not have put into bed mode I found more than enough adjustment with recline and I am 5 ft 11. All meals were very good with plenty of choice and all presented very well. Drinks service very good with friendly crew in galley whenever I wanted something. Arrival in Singapore very good flight crew said goodbye and all seem to have been pleased to see us. Although this was the a380 I think the renewed 777 offering is better.
2013-12-17,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,We flew BOM-SIN-BOM earlier this year for a 10 day holiday in Singapore. The flights were great both ways and we were extremely happy with the choice of food. For BOM-SIN me and my son tried the Lamb dish - but did not like it. The crew promptly replaced this with the available veg choice. The return sector actually had a better choice of Indian food. Beverages choice was also great - and of course they had Tiger beer! Good and no nonsense comfortable flight.
2013-12-17,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-SYD both legs on A380. I couldn't recommend this airline any more. Great legroom for economy and seat pitch hot towels before take off some of the best food I have had in the sky regular drinks service great entertainment system with Krisworld clean cabin (they even had some Xmas decorations up). FA'S were very helpful and the girls were dressed impeccably in their Singapore girl outfits and always smiling and willing to help. The added plus of Changi airport being SQ's hub made transit a very pleasant experience. If you're flying the A380 v1 seating plan - I recommend booking an upper deck economy ticket a small dedicated cabin at the back of the upper deck provides a smaller quieter experience. This is a 5 star airline and blows my home airline BA out of the water. You will not be disappointed! They made over 10000 miles in the air somewhat enjoyable!
2013-12-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,We arrived in Paris today flying SYD-SIN-CDG both legs on the A380. We were seated in upper deck economy which is much better than the lower deck (quieter less people smaller seat configuration). The staff service on both legs was excellent - lots of drink runs and when I discovered one of the earphones on my headset wasn't working I was promptly given a new one. Staff always had a smile and were polite. Seats comfortable food not too bad for economy. Only drawback was the entertainment system could have had more movies.
2013-12-17,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,Perth to Houston TX on SQ 062 my wife and I. Flight to Moscow aborted at last minute routed to Warsaw where Singapore Airlines had no affiliation. Sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in Warsaw then escorted to airport. Once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to Paris and to Houston the next morning. Went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a SA rep. After some time told we could not take this flight. Told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. Told we were being put on a plane to Copenhagen then to Chicago and then to Houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. Inquired why we could not take flight to Paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book. In summary I have been flying internationally my entire oil field career over 30 years I have experienced delays cancellations re-routes etc. I have never seen such a poor handling of a situation as this. I have always chosen Singapore when possible but will think twice in the future.
2013-12-12,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ2 from SIN to HKG on Dec 9th was delayed 5 hours due to faulty parts they had to change aircraft to fly us all home. Despite that there were enough staff to attend to us we were kept informed of the situation very clearly Free drinks and snack boxes provided. Then a dinner up to SGD 15 was provided for us. Staffs were visible ally he time to answer question and calm our fears. When finally boarding we were given a small token as an apology. Arrived in HK at past 2 am we were given free coaches as well as taxi fares to go home depending on our destination. I could not complain but praise this airlines for treating their customers right. Truly deserving its 5 star status all the way! On board the 777-300ER seat was comfortable good AVOD crew were hard working frequent drink top ups and good quality late dinner served. Overall I am impress and will not hesitate to fly with them again and again.
2013-12-10,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,On 23 November I got SQ 068 to Sao Paulo and I was really surprised to see the cleanliness of the aircraft. Unfortunately due to connecting flight problems I lost my flight back to Barcelona and I could not compare - and perhaps change my mind - the poor state of maintenance of aircraft's. I don't think I will be flying again with Singapore but it is also however the best option to fly from Barcelona to Montevideo.
2013-12-09,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,I've recently flown on SQ 423 BOM-SIN connecting SQ217 SIN-MEL in J Class. Can I say at the outset the crew on SQ and their service to the business class passenger is wonderful. I used points to upgrade and it was a rare experience for me to enjoy J class so was really keen to sample SQ business class. Great sized LCD TV screen brand new cabin on SQ423 wide seats and such a massive sense of space! Amazingly for a post-midnight departure ex Mumbai we were served a full 3 course meal which was lovely but it's almost impossible to sleep on a full stomach. Much more logical to serve a light snack on departure and full breakfast before Singapore surely? The menu didn't indicate this was an option to be requested so I assume no breakfast service was available. The seat in recline position was great and quite comfortable but it was after putting the bed down to try and sleep the discomfort began. A very hard lumpy bed from the various joins and cushions. And the massive belt that pins you to the bed is totally uncomfortable. I felt like I was tied to the bed couldn't turn over couldn't breathe and ended up having to sit back up again. Equals no sleep! So so disappointing. I'm happy to drape a seat belt over me while sleeping I'm not prepared to be tied down! SQ 217 on the SIN-MEL leg was an old version of the 1-2-1 config. Dirty walls worn leather seats small TV drinks placed on the shelf at the front so it was a case of having to undo the seat belt and stretch out to take it. Beautiful food excellent service lovely lovely crew. But again the hard uncomfortable bed. A less than enjoyable experience I won't be travelling SQ business again.
2013-12-09,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,On 15/11/13 flight from Brisbane to Singapore leaving at 23.45 was the worst flight with this airline. Old plane no leg room poor service I was flabbergasted as I have been flying with them for years. Coming home the plane was up to their usual standard but I will be very wary of flying or recommending them in the future.
2013-12-09,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from LAX to SIN with a stop over at Narita then SIN to MNL. First time on an A380. Boarding took a while since it was a full flight and there are lot of pax once on board things were very good. FA's were polite and very helpful and are always present whenever you need anything. Food was definitely some of the best airline food I have had with plenty of drink runs dessert and what not. Choice between Japanese and Western. Flight was on time though had a very hard landing in Narita. Was probably the longest flight I have had but it was very enjoyable. SIN-MNL they used an older B777 with IFE not AVOD though unlike the A380 but other than that it was fantastic. Transit at Changi was great had a 12 hour lay over.
2013-12-09,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore - Zurich and return. On the A380 with all business class seating on the upper deck. Overall a very good trip. Departure from SIN is scheduled very late (01.30) so I had no problem getting off to several hours sleep at that time of the morning. Coming back is a daytime flight which I personally find more tiring. Anyway the product remains a solid one. The service was very good. Food and drinks all fine. Still think the IFE system is showing its age compared to say Emirates but quite OK and had no problem finding a few movies to watch on the daytime return flight. My complaints remain the same as ever. The business class seat is plain weird and for taller types like me the diagonal sleeping position is only just long enough. In addition SQ start to look expensive compared to the Gulf carriers for the route I was travelling (SIN-ZRH-NCE) by a couple of thousand S$ which is substantial.
2013-12-07,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight SQ317 (LHR-SIN) on 30th November 2013 seat 27K on upper deck. Check-in was fast although I understand that one of the check-in assistants was rude to my colleague by suggesting it was obvious he'd not flown business class before but hey we were in England and you can't complain about poor service here. The flight itself was fine. I had used BTC for the food. The only let down was the breakfast which was bizarre. I had pre-ordered multigrain toast after a few mis-understandings on what it came with I decided to stay with this choice however I wish I had not. It consisted of 2 pieces of what was more like chipboard than toast accompanied by grilled asparagus carrots aubergine and courgettes and on the same place was a sweet pastry. Not sure who makes up the dishes but this certain was not complimentary to each other. All the veg were dry and chewy. Having usually flown Virgin business class in the past I was used to having my bed made for me but this does not happen in SIA flights also the bed even though lay flat was designed in a way that for me at 6ft2 was very uncomfortable. Overall not a bad experience just some oddities.
2013-12-07,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN-PER return. First leg fantastic upstairs economy on the A380 flight half full with plenty of room stretch out flight attendants friendly attentive very enjoyable. Both legs to and from Perth comfortable enough but nothing to rave about. Return from Singapore was terrible. Boarding call for flight was a late and all classes families with children etc. we're called within in minutes apart total chaos ensued. First class business and economy all cramming in a rush to get on felt like budget airline experience. Flight was full with no room to move attendants stretched to handle the demands of anxious late night passengers lots of small children it's a thin line between a good and a bad flight in economy when full. Still the better economy airline for long haul.
2013-12-07,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight SQ318 (SIN-LHR) Suite 3A. I had the fortune to fly in one of the suites on my return trip. The service in this class is what you would expect private entrance at the airport with the added bonus of a separate security channel. I was taken to the SilverKris lounge and upgraded from the 1st class lounge to the private room. This was a great experience especially having a cook to order breakfast service and a nice sized dinning room. The boarding service itself with a private walkway to the suites was very speedy and as soon as I arrived at the plane door you are taken to your suite by a steward. Seated and then given a guided tour of all the facilities and features. The service itself was amazing if not a little over attentive but being served my the most senior stewards you would expect this. The food was good although some items were a little overcooked. I would recommend this but only if you have about 10k to spend without missing it. The suite itself it very comfortable and when the bed is made it was large enough for me to lay out fully even being 6ft2.
2013-12-06,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,"I have flown SQ for a long time but in the past couple of years I was disappointed to notice the decline in service. I fly between JFK and Singapore a lot and they have not changed the menu on the route in a while. The seats were also cramped and the legroom was awful. I'm 6 feet and my legs were pressed against the seat in from of me. The foot rest doesn't help at all if you are above 5'8"". Boarding is usually pushed back to about 10 minutes before the scheduled departure and the boarding staff in SIN didn't seem to care much. overall the service is now a far cry from what it used to be and I now refuse to fly with them."
2013-12-06,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-Singapore-Sydney/Melbourne-Singapore-LHR. Check in staff polite and efficient cabin crew attentive but not over bearing food as good as you can get when flying drinks readily available and plentiful and seat that comfortable I slept the majority of each flight. All in all a very pleasant experience I always fly Singapore Airlines when flying to Australia.
2013-12-06,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-HND the end of November with Boeing 777-300 (non-ER). The plane is amongst Singapore Airlines' oldest fleets but everything was just comfortable as aircraft's are clean cabin attendants are helpful polite overall service was great. Two thumbs up for SQ as always.
2013-12-04,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Perfect airline to me! Every time I had to fly in a long-haul flight I chose SQ because of its high quality service. It never let me down. The flight from Auckland to Changi SIN was as excellent as usual. Food was great and plenty. The staffs also recommended me to try Singapore Sling and it was great. Whenever I woke up during the night I always saw the crew's smiles. The transfer at Changi Airport was very good too!
2013-12-02,6,6,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew PER-SIN on a 777 and SIN-SUB on A330 last month. Good points: punctual comfortable seats great food great IFE (when you get the chance to use it). Bad points: On these aircraft types at least Singapore Airlines aircraft don't have individual air vents and it can become incredibly stuffy especially on the 777 where the cabin temperature was too hot - not the first time I have had this problem. Also the Surabaya flight was about 2hrs 15min which should have been enough to take in a 90 minute movie; but they didn't turn on Krisworld until about 30 minutes after pushback then 70 min later they collected the headsets and said they would be turning it off. In fact Krisworld kept running for another 30 minutes and was only turned off 15 minutes before landing. Had I known this I could have continued to watch the movie with subtitles - I think this was very poorly managed. Why can't they have IFE throughout the flight? - Qantas manages it.
2013-12-02,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from Singapore to Osaka and back in November 2013. Must say that this has to be the best flight I have taken from boarding to the service and the meal as well as the inflight entertainment. It was an experience that is worth the premium.
2013-11-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Heathrow - Singapore - Perth 31/10/13. Perth - Singapore - Heathrow 18/11/13. The cabin crew made a long flight a pleasure they couldn't do enough - always smiling nothing was too much trouble. I will recommend and certainly fly with them again.
2013-11-27,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-HKG-SIN. Check in at both airports were fast and efficient. The planes on both legs were the Boeing 777-200. The IFE on the plane is in serious need of upgrading. Watching movie was a struggle as the screen resolution is very low. Furthermore it can only be used after the plane took off and before it landed. This is in contrast to some Middle Eastern airlines where the IFE can be used right after stepping in to and before getting off the plane. The cabin crews were polite especially the one on the return leg. She was very helpful and full of smile. The special foods that I requested were available on both leg and tasted ok.
2013-11-27,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew out of Heathrow on 20th November flight 317 to Australia (via Singapore) the onward flight departed Singapore on 21st November flight number 217 to Melbourne. Quite simply the best airline we've flown with. All staff immaculately dressed and turned out. Customer service was second to none. All other airlines should aspire to be like this. British Airways take note you need to up your game.
2013-11-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight from CPH-SIN-AKL on 777-200 and return AKL-SIN-LHR on 777-200/777-300. Perfect service. Amazing staff on board. Great quality of food. A lot of space in Business Class. Comfortable seats especially on new Business Class on 777-200ER and 777-300ER.
2013-11-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I flew from Singapore to Los Angeles (SQ11/SQ12). Being a krisflyer member I never regret taking a Singapore Airlines flight. It has truly made my flight comfortable. Food was excellent customer service was good and so were the seats.
2013-11-21,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-SYD. Flight not full so plenty of room on board. Refurbished 777 was comfortable and in-flight entertainment good without being spectacular. As usual service was excellent - cheerful attentive polite - everything you come to expect from SQ! Very satisfied and will continue to use this airline.
2013-11-21,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,I've been flying SQ now for more than 30 years (Business and Y-Cl/Longhaul and shorthaul) and have never experienced any problems with this airline: Last Flight: MUC-MAN return: at both airports no queues at check-in organised boarding friendly and helpful crews even on this short route choice of different snacks and additional drink rounds and full IFE. Prices below Easyjet fares on this route! Flights on time or ahead of schedule! There are only 2 small negative points for this route: quite early departure from MUC (06.10 am) and since some time you are not any more allowed to earn LH Miles on this route despite SQ is a STAR Alliance member.
2013-11-21,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,What a refreshing experience. We travelled to Singapore less expensive than alternatives and better value for money. Our flight was on time the plane clean modern and well presented. The staff delightful on both outbound and Inbound journeys impeccably presented and with a welcoming smile. They were attentive and went about the cabin helping passengers with a smile and minimum fuss. Unlike other airlines we had a printed menu the food was excellent served very nicely proper cutlery too. Ample choice of entertainment if you can't make a choice from all offered you're not trying. Very nice 'wake up' gradual using staged lighting relaxing music playing for landing. Could not fault this airline will be looking to book with Singapore Airlines again.
2013-11-18,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,We flew SYD-SIN on 30 Sept 13 and had a wonderful flight. The staff were great and the food and wine very good. I would like to commend the purser for his kindness and help on this flight. The return flight on 10 Nov 13 was almost the opposite to the last flight. The food was not so good and overcooked. I regret my harsh comments to a staff member on the matter. I would still fly with Singapore in the future.
2013-11-18,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,KUL-SIN-BCN and return. Both on B777-300ER economy class. The aircraft seating was comfortable with good selection of inflight entertainment. Service is as usual impeccable and faultless. The cabin crew were very helpful attentive and generous with drinks and snacks in between flight. Just encountered some delay on return leg resulting in missed connection. Otherwise truly value for money.
2013-11-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-SIN on 10 Nov 2013. Excellent service as usual fantastically attentive and friendly staff - moved me to a bulkhead seat to give me extra legroom. Food great drinks always available lots of water provided. Aircraft entertainment more than adequate. Normal high standard.
2013-11-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-HKG return on A380s. I was lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck seats 74A and 76K. There was a side storage compartment beside the window seats. Upper deck economy cabin is a small cabin which contains around 80 seats. SIN-HKG I was greeted by the FA's with smiles food was very good. HKG-SIN flight an unusual announcement made by the captain about strong winds on the end of the airfield . Upon reaching 1500ft when engine power was reduced the plane felt a sudden drop in altitude causing most of the passengers including me to shout. Babies on board this route was also crying. When seatbelt signs were switched off staff were trying to keep the baby calm. I would recommend on the A380 to take seats on the upper deck as it is quieter and more attention from FA's.
2013-11-10,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Brisbane-Singapore-Shanghai. Crew friendly and helpful. A330-300 Brisbane to Singapore and Boeing 777 Singapore to Shanghai travelling in a group if 45 people. Return Beijing-Singapore-Brisbane with friendly crew members. Very good food on all flights and a wide range I movies on in-flight entertainment. Seats were very comfortable. Got a window seat nearly every time.
2013-11-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew CGK-SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN-CGK. SIN-FRA-JFK and LAX-NRT-SIN were on the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-200 for both CGK-SIN and SIN-CGK. Flight was fine choices of food were great the inflight entertainment system was one of the best that i had ever used. Couldn't sleep on flight to JFK because the cabin was too noisy. But thank goodness that I could sleep peacefully on my way back from LAX to SIN. In terms of seating the seat was comfortable though there's still room for improvement maybe additional inches to the seat pitch would help. In the end I would definitely fly on Singapore Airlines again.
2013-11-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ327 MAN-SIN via MUN. My first flight ever with Singapore Airlines and I was very impressed. On an Economy ticket the meal choices were amazing and I even had the chance to order snacks and sandwiches at any point in between meal service. The FT's were helpful and courteous no matter what the problem or request was. There were 2 downsides only. 1) Having to fly via Munich disembark and sit in the airport for 1.5hrs. 2) The individual screens had the movies on a rolling system so you had to wait until its run was over to start watching the film you wanted from the beginning. With all the films at different lengths this meant a lot of planning to get your timings right throughout the 16hr flight. Of course I wanted to sleep as well and due to the chairs being comfortable and the added help of a window seat I was able to get a few hrs. We arrived 45mins early so I was able to get my connecting flight to HKG with ease. Overall a very good quality flight and I would not hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.
2013-11-05,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,My first SQ experience in 35+ years travelling was a mixed bag in regional A330 Business class to/from SIN connecting with (other carrier) European flights. Service on outward SQ236 BNE-SIN sector reflected many online reviews I had read: zealously attentive but semi-robotic and impersonal. My change of seat at check-in from 14A to 14K obviously threw the pre-flight cabin briefing off its tracks it was not until the third F/A interaction after the seatbelt signs had been turned off in the climb to cruise that the penny dropped that neither my surname nor my gender matched those the crew were using in dealing with me. At times I felt like a participant in a training video or that the crew couldn't wait to get home. That said the inwards SQ235 SIN-BNE return and final sector of a long trip two weeks later was an outstanding contrast with the archetypal Singapore Girl service striking exactly the right note: attentive without being intrusive modulated and moderated without being mechanical and generally more relaxed comfortable and charming. An invitation to be briefed on the seat controls would have been nice – the SQ regional J-boxes being rather unique – but the food drink and Kris-World IFE could not be faulted. My first time changing terminals at SIN too was a pleasantly seamless experience the Silver Kris lounge and its staff set an example to the industry world-wide.
2013-11-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ860 SIN-HKG. 777-200ER. After flying MAN-SIN via MUN this flight was my final leg. I was greeted by FT who when looking at my boarding pass knew straight away that I had a special dietary requirement. Throughout the flight this FT seemed to have remembered a certain number of people's names in our cabin and spoke to us only by using Mr or Mrs as a prefix to our personal names. I was overly impressed as this is something you just don't expect in Economy Class. The service was excellent with refreshments throughout the flight. FT's were friendly and didn't disturb you if you wanted to sleep. A very comfortable trip with personal entertainment lots of leg room and a very high standard of service. What more could you want?
2013-11-01,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Sydney-London return all legs on the A380. The pitch was modest but it was still fine for me. Seat was a little hard but I still managed to catch some sleep on all 4 legs. Food was fabulous except on the Singapore- London leg the pasta was dry and hard. IFE was excellent with a wide array of choices and the staff service was unmatched even in economy class. The Singapore girls were all very attentive yet friendly attending to our needs efficiently. First time on this airline and definitely not the last for me.
2013-11-01,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,I had a flight from KUL-SIN-SYD with the A330 and A380. The flight was very successful great with good aircrew service and more than I expected. The food was like normal.
2013-10-30,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-BKK-SIN. Flew this leg on the 772 aircraft's which are one of the oldest in SIA's fleet. What was disappointing was the poor KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system. It was really old. The display on the screens were barely visible and that the buttons on the controls were hard to press. The seats was a bit cramped on the older planes. On food SIA met its expectations. I chose a seafood meal on the return trip and it was certainly appetizing.
2013-10-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-FRA on A380 upper deck emergency exit seats 71 H&K. Note these seats have no overhead storage as they are full of first aid equipment so try to get on early as you will struggle to find space. Initial start to flight was not good with a 1 hour delay and later finding out that the TV screen did not lock into place. What happened next was nothing short of amazing and should be a lesson in customer service (Emirates I hope you read this as SIA economy is better than your Business Class). Leading stewardess managed to tape the screen in place and I was able to use for the rest of the flight with juts a minor inconvenience. I was offered the chance to move but declined as my wife and I wanted the extra leg room. Service was fantastic thought out the flight which staff coming around with drinks and snacks often (we were not singled out) We were given a voucher to use on duty free which we used straight away to buy a honeymoon present. On hearing this the leading FA said she had a surprise for us and later came back with a congratulatory gift of a slice of cake and 2 glasses of Dom Perignon from First Class. This was the best experience I had on a flight regardless of class. The last four flights on SIA have been very good and consistent it is also nice to see that the staff are allowed to let their personality shine through.
2013-10-29,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,PER-SIN on B772 older aircraft with reduced entertainment selection. Seats were hard and in need of re-padding. Staff were friendly and genuine with a sense of humor. Also nice to see that they don't tell you every time that there is turbulence to sit down fasten seat belts etc once when it occurred was fine the rest of the time they assumed we listened. The last time I flew this leg the announcement was made 20 times. Good flight departed 15 min late arrived 15 min early.
2013-10-29,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,FRA-SIN-PER. First leg on A380 upper deck window seat. Seat was ok for a 12 hour flight storage bin between seat and window was really handy. Service very good with FA friendly and come around often which drinks and snacks. Meals offered on both legs were much better than anything I have eaten on economy in a very long time. Entertainment system worked fine with enough movies to keep you entertained for 3 days non stop. B772 on second leg was an older plane but still clean seats offered a bit more leg room but were hard as padding seemed warn out. Standard of service was again excellent. Both flights delayed FRA was by 45min due to tower and SIN by 1.5 hours due to a connecting flight being late. Latter part annoying as it got me into Perth airport when 4 planes had landed around the same time. The airport cannot cope and took me 1.5 hours to get out. (not the airlines fault).
2013-10-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew LHR-SIN and return. The flight into Singapore was on the new B77W that was really state of the art. The seats were indeed more spacious as advertised. The IFE was totally top-notch with the huge screen and countless entertainment options. Food was terrific on both flights. Back to London on the A380 with the older (although still quite new) product. I sat in the small cabin at the upper deck which is really a big plus since it was way more cosy. Staff on both flights were very friendly and welcoming as always. SIA is still my airline of choice while travelling to Asia or Australia.
2013-10-23,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-KIX and FUK-SIN-MEL in Economy with MEL-SIN on A380 and all others on A330. Enjoyable flights in terms of comfort food and entertainment although the seats on the SIN-KIX leg was definitely a bit firmer than expected. Excellent service from cabin & ground service on all flights with the latter especially friendly & efficient at FUK. Probably the most consistently enjoyable food my wife and I have had on SIA or on any other carrier in Economy over the past 5 years or so. The entertainment system is extensive with more than enough choice for us although the advertising can be annoying after a while. A problem I experienced with the unit on the SIN-MEL flight was overcome when a particularly helpful cabin staff member re-started my system several times and then checked with me 2 or 3 times after that to ensure there had not been any further issues. SIA continues to be our airline of choice between MEL and Asia.
2013-10-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 298 CHC-SIN Biz with no amenity bag. Boeing 777-300 with reclined seat that did not lay flat. Braised duck meal was so tough and not really edible. Had to ask for a roast beef sandwich instead. Older FAs were very nice and gave good service.
2013-10-22,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 297 from SIN-CHC. This is a long haul overnight flight on a Boeing 777-300 Biz seat reclined not fully flat. No amenity bag provided only the useless slippers and blind shade in Biz class. Food was OK. FAs were attentive.
2013-10-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ 978 Biz on Airbus 330. This is a short-haul flight from SIN-BKK. Comfortable seat that lay fully flat. I had a meal of chewy roasted pork. Service from FAs were nice.
2013-10-22,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,BKK-SIN Old 777-300 Biz with no private TV screen and no inflight entertainment at all. Food was OK. Service OK. Seat reclined but not flat.
2013-10-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,CGK-SIN-CGK on the new A330. Utilized the web check-in and the process was fast when collecting boarding pass at the counter. Flight was only half full for the outbound flight. Cabin crews were going extra mile to serve the passengers - continuously offering drinks after meal. The inbound flight was also pleasant with the same high quality standard in terms of services. Very pleasant flight.
2013-10-20,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flew SQ22 from SIN-EWR (the world's longest flight) on 26th September on board a A340-500 approx. 18-20 hour flight (depending on winds). Unfortunately this route is disappearing very soon and I will miss the specially design all-business class airplane a lot. This day the service was spot-on the airplane/seat/configuration (1-2-1) food drinks - everything was exemplified ""best practice"". It was surely a memorable flight and yes I was the last to get off the plane."
2013-10-18,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,A380 LHR-SIN Return sector of round-trip on 14/10/13. A faultless flight experience on the all-Business Class upper deck thanks to the swift check-in and boarding impeccable seat and cabin an exemplary cabin crew delicious meals and impressive IFE. No other airline offers such a calming inflight Business Class environment. I always arrive rested and refreshed after a long-haul flight with SIA and look forward to the next. It never fails to impress me how well-groomed the crew are (an important detail many passengers fail to notice such as the ambient music played at the right volume after landing) and how promptly attentive they are to passenger's needs. SIA remains polished peerless and focused on their product and services for the FIT. This flight demonstrated all SIA's qualities perfectly.
2013-10-16,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN-MAA-SIN-MEL. MEL to SIN on 777-300. SIN-MAA-SIN on A330-300. Home trip SIN to MEL on A380. Staff excellent. Food very good (book the cook). No amenity kit. Lounge food was OK but not great. Breakfast at MEL lounge was terrible I left and went to ANZ lounge. Lounge at MAA is not worth commenting (not great at all). The MAA to SIN flight is tough as it departs close to midnight and arrives in Singapore less than 4 hours later so not much time for decent sleep. But overall I was rather comfortable on the 777 and A330 angle seats. But the A380 lie flat bed is not long enough (am 6ft 1). Terrible night's sleep I couldn't fly Singapore again until they have a bed that caters for near average height people. Expected more from a reputable airline.
2013-10-16,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,"I have recently returned from a trip to Bali with Singapore Airlines. Overall the journey was ok. Outbound we were in economy cabin on the upper deck of the A380 and we were lucky enough to get seated in the rows of two seats which were comfortable enough. I'm 6.1"" and my travel companion is 6.3"" and in terms of leg room for us there was not a lot. There is also a foot rest fitted to the back of the seat in front which when raised digs in to your shins. When it's lowered you can stretch your legs out over it but it then digs in to your calf muscles. It's poor design and it does affect comfort somewhat but not to the point of distraction. There were plenty of entertainment options available. Both my partner and I had issues with the IFE on the outbound leg which lasted about 30 minutes but the steward was able to re-boot the system for us eventually. The food was good and plentiful and the service was also excellent. The crew were constantly passing through the cabin handing out water and juice and other drinks were available during the flight from the back of the plane. The flights to and from Bali were on a 777-200 and both were fine. One thing to note we were served curry on the flight to DPS and it was hot. Sinagpore may need to tone down the chilli a little. Return leg from SIN-LHR was on 777-300 and at boarding it didn't look like it would be a full flight. We were in the forward economy cabin and this filled up and most seats were taken. However the rear cabin was virtually empty and people here were quick to take up whole rows to themselves. There could have been a better distribution of passengers to allow everyone to have a bit more room. Overall a great airline which with a few tweaks could be fantastic. I certainly felt that with other airlines flying long haul I've had more room."
2013-10-15,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flight SQ319 London to Singapore on 14/10/2013. Cabin crew were the nicest and most helpful crew we have come across in our travels. Would definitely recommend. We travel business class - well worth the money. Ground staff in Heathrow - taking our luggage 10 hours pre-flight was excellent we were so grateful. Will definitely travel with them again.
2013-10-15,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,NRT-LAX A380 upon boarding cabin crew guided me to the wrong side of cabin and wrong seat. No menu was provided for the entire flight and I did not know which champagne or wine I was drinking nor did I know what to expect for dinner or breakfast. Only for the main course (entree) did the cabin crew provide a quick booklet which after choosing was quickly taken away again. After asking cabin crew for a little help to figure out how to convert my seat into bed I was asked if it was my first time with Singapore Airlines (I am Krisflyer Gold). Cabin crew never asked if I wanted to be awaken for breakfast (which I did not). After waking me up and providing me with a cup of coffee I waited 50 minutes for breakfast to be served. Again no menu. A rather disappointing service.
2013-10-15,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD - SIN - LHR - SIN - SYD. Flight attendants did their utmost to be polite and offer individual service which was very impressive. Loved the added extras. The movies were good and there was sufficient variety. I had special meals and they were plentiful and tasty. Lots of drinks offered. Seats were just OK - the area behind the passenger's head is not positioned well and is therefore uncomfortable but otherwise the seat is OK and there was just enough leg room. Most flights were in ageing planes but the personalised service made up for it. I found the attendants to be the real strength of this airline. I would definitely fly them again.
2013-10-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Flew LHR-SIN-SYD. LHR-SIN on A380 all business upper deck. Seats A B & C row 61 main deck. Good leg room (I'm 5' 10"" 16 stone heavy build). Seat comfort was good for economy. Food and drink standard and service were great. Crew could not have been nicer. SIN-SYD on A380 rear upper deck economy. Seats F G & L row 82 upper deck. Good leg room again. Great service and refreshments again. Lovely crew again. Have flown SIA before and will fly with them again."
2013-10-13,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,"SQ A380 SIN-SYD biz class. Young slightly disorganised flight crew (seats and entertainment systems we all like and know about) so this is about to very evident cost cutting by SIA as demonstrated by poor meal service offered. Had ordered Sushi via ""Book the Cook"" and as per inflight menu entree was a cold crab salad. 2 cold dishes that took well on 2 hours to get to my table for dinner. Sushi for biz class was rather disappointing but only until this experience was topped by the ""continental breakfast"": 2 slices each of papaya and pomelo accompanied by a small roll/danish pastry with butter and choice of jam tea or coffee - no second offering and plates couldn't be cleared fast enough. Would have thought you already saved enough on that sub-standard Bollinger being served."
2013-10-10,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from LAX to Koh Samui via Narita and Singapore. Long flight in economy seating. Paid a little extra ($50/per seat) for leg space worth it for me. The staff on board were exemplary in their treatment of the guests and yes even in the economy seats I felt were treated well by the on board staff. Extremely polite I'm a nervous flyer and they made feel very confident in their abilities. I would definitely recommend this airline to anyone flying to Asia.
2013-10-09,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,From Adelaide to Singapore and return in A330-300 Singapore to London and return in A380. The A330 was reasonably new on the way up but an older rattler coming back. Also I don't understand when you leave Singapore at midnight why you only have a choice of three main dishes? After a few hours in the Silver Kris lounge all I wanted was a snack such as cheese & biscuits or a sandwich - with a glass of Bollinger to help send me to sleep! It's a less than 7-hour flight with a big tailwind so why over-cater? Both A380 flights were impeccable. Even smarter service going up than coming back. Wonderful to have a lie-flat and a hectare of room to sleep in and a functional wide- choice IFE. In my view Qantas made a big mistake dropping its QF81 service to Singapore in favour of going via Dubai. Hint: You need to think like passengers do not like a Qantas executive's dream.
2013-10-07,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew Bali to LHR via Singapore on 4th Oct. Bali to Singapore on 777-200 showing its age very small screen to view films etc but no big deal as flight was just over 2 hours. Ran out of my choice of meal but crew were great. Singapore to LHR on 777-300 ER instead of A380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. Food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast. Large seat back screen and plane was fitted with new Krisworld system so plenty of choice of Films TV shows etc. No trolley drinks service after take off just crew with a tray of water juice and beer.
2013-10-07,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SFO-INC on a B777-300ER. The legroom was ok nothing exceptional. The cabin and toilets were kept clean throughout the duration of the flight. The krisworld IFE was superb with a wide range of movies music and games. The 2 meals were delicious and probably the best I have tasted in the air. The cabin crew as always were exceptional serving the drinks frequently to keep us well hydrated. Will recommend this airline.

2013-10-01,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,I have been travelling on SIA for last 12 years. I find the standard of service dropping every time I take the airline in the recent past. NZ to Singapore is a long trip. The service was really poor never got what was requested. Food was bad did not even bother to eat my final meal on the return trip to NZ. Some staff rude their standard of service was bias on the type of passenger. July trip was the worst airline experience I have had in my 20 years of airline travel. Very substandard service. In future travelling on SIA is not a status but a necessity.
2013-09-29,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,FRA-SIN on A380. The upper deck is a real comfy little cabin as there are only around 15 rows in Economy. This improves the service even more. Food reasonable as always. IFE broke down after 6 hours and couldn't be fixed again bud didn't want to switch my seat. I like the opportunity to charge my mobile at the plane as I use it a lot for listening to music.
2013-09-29,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,ADL-SIN-DME / LHR-SIN-ADL. Four legs with SQ for this trip to Europe. Seems that catering has improved since my last trip in April. All aircraft (330 777-300 & 380) were comfortable and clean. Ground staff and crew were friendly and IFE was excellent. Still offering the best product for international travel by far.
2013-09-26,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled on 17th September with my wife and 17 month old London to Singapore. Really great staff looked after our daughter very well indeed. We paid for her own seat which we fitted her car seat into which was ideal. Food was good with a great choice. Really enjoyed flying Singapore and on the A380 was even better than I expected.
2013-09-26,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Singapore to Japan on a late night flight 11pm to 9am. I was surprised that the drinks service was reduced to being given a choice of juice water or beer from trays instead of the full drinks cart service. I got what I requested when I asked for it specifically. The menu card provided listed that a selection of snacks are available upon request before breakfast. When I asked what the options were the stewardess gave me a few pieces of tiny biscuits. On the way back the stewardess gave me the option of instant noodles or biscuits. I wonder if these are cost cutting measures. The new advertisements portrayed better service though hence I was disappointed. Air France and KLM offers a much better snack selection of chocolates fruits sandwiches cakes throughout their flight. The choice of entertainment options is great though.
2013-09-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Manchester to Singapore via Munich return. There was good choice of food a nice dinner (with 3 main course choices) and a cooked breakfast as well as another light snack. The cabin crew came around frequently during the flight with orange juice and water. Also snacks and chocolates were available on request from the galley! A good selection of films along with free headphones and a comfort pack of toothpaste toothbrush socks etc. The cabin crew were very welcoming and helpful with assisting passengers with finding seats and locating space for carry on luggage. Previously I have flown a lot with American Airlines and Iberia which do not come anywhere near to Singapore Airlines. I had forgotten that long haul travel in economy class could be so delightful! Singapore Airlines were wonderful.
2013-09-25,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ12 to Los Angeles Via Tokyo on the Sep 11 and SQ 11 return on 24th Sep. Flight was not entirely full approximately 70%. Had 3 seats to myself which was nice. Seat was comfortable and not as hard as one would imagine. Drinks service begins once we took off and it came back on intervals throughout the duration of the flight time. Food was great and i went for both of the Japanese selection which was awesome. Krisworld was excellent too with lots of entertainment though it should be using touch screen by now. (Those who are transiting to Los Angeles will need to exit the plane transit through security and back in the gate). All these took 10 mins and with lots of help from the Japanese and Singapore crew. Great Airline Great service.
2013-09-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Traveled from Singapore to Zurich on A380. The Kirsworld entertainment system is excellent! but not touchscreen and must be operated by a remote which seemed old to me. The food served on board this Singapore Airlines flight sector was great! I was served two meals and both tasted okay no complains from me. The service standards from the FA is still as good as before! As this was a long haul flight toothbrushes and socks were given out to all the passengers including blankets and pillows. The FA's made lots of trips around serving water and OJ trying not to make the passengers dehydrated because of the flight. The FA's also forced all passengers to shut their window blinds to give passengers more rest as it was in the day. Overall another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines!
2013-09-24,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ228 SQ68 SQ365 SQ227. Melbourne to Barcelona return. Excellent experience with Singapore Airlines. The service is excellent. Cant complain even though 23 hours of flying in economy is difficult. The service was outstanding and would not have any doubts recommending to anyone. The staff are excellent and the service is top notch even for economy.
2013-09-22,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,A380 Singapore to Milan. Sub standard champagne average at best food average wines with food. This was a night flight. Cabin attendant allowed children to enter [from economy] and exit their parents in business class near me and this resulted in a minimum of sleep for me and perhaps others around these parents.
2013-09-22,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL to SIN SQ228 and SIN to PARIS SQ334 on A380. Excellent attentive service good food and wines and a comfortable flight on a very quiet aircraft. Could not ask for more. The Krisworld IFE has TV series rather than the one episode much appreciated.
2013-09-22,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,My husband and I were very impressed with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew were polite professional and attentive during the flight. I was impressed with how they kept the bathrooms clean during the flight always with a smile on their faces. The food was very good - we were in economy plus and very impressed with all meals. While the uniforms are beautiful I did wonder how they would perform in any emergency of vacating the plane. We would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.
2013-09-16,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"SYD-SIN on A380. SQ lounge in Sydney closed for refurbishment - NZ lounge no substitute. Charming crew (one of the best I had on SQ) very attentive with some great characters- the wide seat (with limited recline) is fine by me but look forward to new seat on 777's. Catering not that great (still quite good) but appears to suffer from ""cost savings""? Nice selections of teas - champagne not worth the name . IFE great selection and good screen size."
2013-09-15,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,AMS-SIN. Singapore Airlines is a class act. The flight attendants were terrific the cabin was comfortable and inviting and the food was absolutely delicious. Long-haul flights are just more pleasant on this carrier.
2013-09-15,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew from SIN to SGN on a 777. The plane was showing its age and the seat was uncomfortable. Had to book last minute at the airport - no Internet option. Very expensive.
2013-09-10,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,A380 SIN-LHR. Sublime service spacious seating/bedding arrangements. Very good food excellent inflight entertainment. Overall a highly enjoyable and recommended flying experience. Managed to get 6 hrs sleep which was a bonus. Only slight criticism was colour of interior a tad bland.
2013-09-09,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,JFK-SIN-BKK and SIN-JFK. Seat on A380 is uncomfortable for a long flight. Old style seats on B777-200er are much more comfortable. Foods served on all flights were delicious. FA's were great and served with smiles on all segments of the flight. Upper deck of A380 is much more quieter and easier to sleep on long haul flights. Singapore airlines assigned four FA's on upper deck to serve 88 passengers which is very efficient to get meals served quicker. Frequently providing the drink run. Sandwiches fresh fruits chips mixed fruits and drinks were available at the galley for hungry passengers to snack on at night.
2013-09-08,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,CMB-SIN-CGK-SIN-CMB. Outbound flight from Colombo was satisfactory. Crew were friendly and meals were in large quantities. Aircraft was well maintained. SIN-CGK - Crew were in competition with the timing but still met satisfactory standards. Return CGK-SIN flew the 777-300 left Jakarta at 1705 hrs and landed on time. Singapore- Colombo Main course was inedible and dressed with unnecessary oil. Crew were efficient but no smiles. Highly recommend the airline.
2013-09-08,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-SIN and SIN-LHR on A380s travelling as a couple with two children under 2. SQ remains our first choice after yet again making potentially challenging flights more than bearable. Having booked well in advance the airline blocked a window seat at the front of economy (row 31) to give us extra room for our toddler who was too big for the bassinet. Crew were patient and very accommodating providing milk on several occasions and even washing bottles for us. There was never a crossed word from them even when the toddler made one of his regular sprints through the galleys. I requested seafood meals at booking which were excellent. IFE was very good as always. Our double stroller was delivered promptly after landing to the jetway. I am more than happy to pay the extra money to fly SQ.
2013-09-08,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN to Zurich. Return Amsterdam to SIN. As usual when I fly on Singapore Airlines the food service is their strongest suit - excellent except for the wine which is closer to vinegar than alcohol. Seats are alright but not any more comfortable than on other airlines. IFE system awkward to use and earbuds uncomfortable. Their weakest point? Staff Service. Flight attendants polite but extremely robotic and not particularly friendly. They always seem to be reading from a script when talking to passengers. Crew on just about any other airline do a much better job of making customers feel welcome.
2013-09-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN on SQ 208. I felt A330 seats were more comfortable than the bigger aircraft A380. Food was superb and you will never go wrong with Krisworld - the inflight entertainment. Staff were attentive and there is no doubt that this is one of the top 5 star airlines in the world.
2013-09-05,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-SYD. It was a midnight flight staff tried their best to serve all passengers without disturbing their sleep. Staff were friendly and food was served in a prompt manner. Good range of inlight entertainment but it's the seats that allow you to have adequate rest even in economy class. Might not be the cheapest for a 5 star airlines but it's worth every single cent as they ensure that you get to your final destination safely and comfortably.
2013-09-03,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,My husband and I flew 28th July Tullamarine - Singapore SQ 238. 29th July Singapore - London SQ 318. 27th Aug London - Singapore SQ319 Singapore - Tullamarine SQ217. I have nothing but high praise for staff at all time. Attendants were attentive polite and helpful. Food was fine and plenty of it. We haven't travelled a lot but Singapore Airlines will be my choice of airline.
2013-09-03,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,AMS-SIN-CGK. Flight was on time. Arrived at Singapore Changi airport on time nice airport for transit. Aircraft from AMS-SIN was refitted B777-200ER. which is quiet old but clean nice and comfortable (use 3x3x3 configuration). Staff on both flights were attentive they also offered drinks every several times. However the LCD screen for the entertainment is quite old so the resolution of the screen wasn't really clear.
2013-09-01,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,FRA-JFK-FRA on A380. Outbound good service good food - especially the deserts - and hard working and friendly crew who gave plenty of drinks. Inbound good service again but bad food and ran out of choice. Both flights left bang on time and arrived early inbound even 45 mins earlier. Efficient boarding on big A380 which has fantastic IFE but not more legroom than any other plane or airline. Would have thought SQ give their flagship a more spectacular cabin design but no difference from other planes. All in all good experience for a reasonable price but not on par with e.g. Qatar Airways.
2013-08-29,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew economy London to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore and back. Full flight on both long haul legs but staff were good - efficient attentive and constantly offering drinks. Queues for toilets were short quality of food good and lots of movies. Found the games not up to scratch and showing their age. Seat and legroom comfortable enough. Definitely the best carrier to the Far East. Stopover in Singapore airport good with lots to do.
2013-08-28,2,2,Singapore Airlines customer review,Sydney to Singapore 27th July 2013 SQ232 and returned 13th August 2013 on SQ211. Outbound flight was good on the A380. Attendants robotic but efficient nonetheless even though they took their time responding to request buttons. Seats aren't the worst but not the best. Recline was good seat pitch not so much. I enjoyed the meals on this flight especially the Western steak cooked perfectly. Nothing too troublesome. The return leg however was very disappointing on a tattered B777 aircraft. Seats were extremely uncomfortable with small recline and an industry standard 32 inch seat pitch. Crew were far less attentive than the first leg. It took different crew trying to ask for some basic toiletries or a glass of water. Seat back TV's were tiny and intermittently froze throughout the flights. Overall whilst the first flight was above average the return was far from acceptable.
2013-08-26,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Took SQ's flight bound for Taipei a few weeks back. Brunch meal was served omelette with baked beans grilled chicken sausage and tomato - tasted decent but having baked beans on a 5-star airline just does not seem to fit the line. Service was great with crew readily available should you have any needs/queries. Flight journey was smooth too. Seats were rather comfortable with head rest. AVOD was up to date with interesting movies and games but the earphone is rather uncomfortable. Probably SQ should invest in noise-cancelling headphones for Y class passengers in futures. SQ is also family-friendly as there is a kids channel in AVOD and activities for kids such as coloring books.
2013-08-19,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,July 20th SIN-SFO via ICN. Return August 2 SFO-SIN via ICN. SA has always been rated very high for service but I think they are starting to cut corners. Their equipment still looks great seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment is great but the service is really slipping. I rang the call button 3 times during one flight as I desperately needed a soda but nobody ever came. The meals have definitely been shrinking in size and the kids meals are becoming more unusual. A kids meal should almost be generic like pizza or spaghetti but you rarely see those offered.

2013-08-19,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flying the SQ flagship A380 on the Frankfurt - NY route is a total joy. This is truly a premium airline with a top notch product and service. Although there is more competition these days in the premium airline category SQ truly brings back the romance of flying. Their superb service and product makes the premium price totally worth it. Of course now as I enter the US I have to prepare myself for flying the American carriers. They have a thing or two to learn about from SQ.
2013-08-19,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ uses the refurbished 777-200ERs on the Singapore - Amsterdam route. Although this is the new business class seat the cabin is not quite the same as the new 777-300ER planes that have the same product. The main difference is in the IFE system. Masked as a new system it actually seems to be the old system built into the new seat. Thus the selection of movies and quality of display is lacking. For the rest it's up to the impeccable SQ standard. Unbelievable service terrific food and a great bed.
2013-08-18,4,4,Singapore Airlines customer review,SUB-SIN with SIA in Economy Class. Flight was delayed by one hour due to late arrival from SIN. Once on board the crew distributed hot towels but not all passenger got it. Food was edible and the entertainment system worked well. The in-flight service was not so good some FA were just friendly whereas the others were not. A steward even raised his voice while asking my little boy to switch off his IPAD around 40 minutes before our arrival at the Changi Airport. All in all for the price I paid it was not what I expected from a 5 star airline.
2013-08-15,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,Airbus A380 from LAX to Singapore with a stop at Tokyo-Narita. Excellent cockpit crew and cabin staff. Very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Ground staff at LAX and at Changi were very helpful courteous and friendly. Once the plane reaches cruising altitude it is practically quiet. We will always fly on SIA whenever our schedules allow. We go to Asia every 2 to 3 years and SIA is our first choice!
2013-08-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew MEL-SIN-IST business class. Really enjoyed the new MEL lounge which has a nice modern feel. The first leg was on the 777-300 with the regional business seat which was comfortable. The crew on this leg however were very robotic and just went through the motions. SIN-IST was on the refitted 777-200ER and the service and food was amazing. The crew could not do enough for us and insisted on making our beds. We used booked the cook on this leg and the food was of a very high quality. The seat on the refitted 777 have a few extra storage areas compared those seats on the A380 which I like. I do find the food in the Singapore lounge to be rather uninspiring considering Singapore itself is such a food orientated city. We will fly with SQ again.
2013-08-13,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,New York to Singapore Via Frankfurt SQ25 August 1 A380. Airplane interior is showing its age. Inflight entertainment has a lot of movies and music to choose from and food in Economy Class is delicious. Snack between meals is good with sandwiches chips and fruits. Singapore to Bangkok SQ972 on August 3 was a Boeing 777-200. The seats in Economy Class are getting old. Singapore Airlines should fly the new Economy Seats to Bangkok or fly the Airbus 330-300. Overall the food and Entertainment in Economy Class is excellent.
2013-08-12,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,Flew A380 Suites on SIN-HKG-SIN over the national day holidays. Excellent crew; very accommodating and attentive to needs. In-flight entertainment was giving me issues on the leg home but was promptly resolved after I brought it to the crew's attention. Great seat width and food was good despite not having booked the cook in advance. Otherwise a great flight but avoid the 4th rows where possible as it is near the pantry so it tends to be noisy.
2013-08-11,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,SYD-SIN-BKK-SIN-SYD on a combination of A380 / A330 / 777-200 (2class)/ 777-300ER. Was very happy with every aspect of every flight (except the 1.5hr delay on the last leg). The seats were comfortable on each flight and the catering was superb. I suggest you 'book the cook' and select your exact meal before flying as it was very good. IFE was great on all flights as was the service standards.
2013-08-07,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,Sydney to Singapore last month on 12th and returned 4th August. Inflight experience was alright and staff were generally good some not so much. Food was shoddy on both flights and ended up leaving most of it. Entertainment choices are probably the best out there but the operating system is old and deteriorating. Both flights were on time. Overall it was pretty ordinary and probably better off flying cheaper and spending more in Singapore.
2013-08-07,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ478 to Johannesburg on 18 June 2013 and returned on SQ479 (departing Johannesburg 20 June). Flight scheduled to leave Singapore around 1am and due to some aircraft problems after boarding we had to return to the terminal and wait for a new aircraft. Flight resumed close to 7am. SIA arranged for refreshments immediately as well as pillows and blankets for our wait at the new boarding gate. My biggest compliment is the crew. The same crew served us on the flight back.
2013-08-06,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Rome to Singapore and back is serviced by old 777-200 with old seats and the seats do not recline completely. I have friends that are flying Qatar to Singapore because of better aircraft's. I fly business class to Singapore every 6 months and I am seriously thinking of changing airlines or fly to Singapore via London to fly the A380. Returned Singapore to Rome on SQ366 Aug 4.
2013-08-06,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Travelled for the first time with Singapore to New Zealand a very long trip. The cabin staff were excellent friendly helpful always ready to have a laugh. The food by and large was fine especially for Economy and the choice of Inflight entertainment was very good. The crew made what could have been a grisly experience into an enjoyable one. Seats were fairly cramped in economy.
2013-08-04,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SIN-HND-SIN. Both flights outbound and inbound were great cabin and toilets were clean crew members were friendly and in-flight entertainment system was awesome. Will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again good job and keep up the good work Singapore Airlines!
2013-08-04,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Used SQ for our trip to Vietnam. Lived up to their reputation on all 4 flights. A380 on the 2 longer sectors which was a comfortable journey and found seats and legroom both ok. Older B777/200 on shorter flights which are showing some age but are very well maintained. Food was plentiful and actually quite nice for airline food. Plenty to drink and regular drink runs carried out. IFE had plenty of variety to keep us amused. Crew members polite and friendly. A little more expensive than some other carriers but well worth it for the little extra we paid. Overall would recommend and will always be our first option providing price is reasonable.
2013-07-31,1,1,Singapore Airlines customer review,Business Class Sydney - Singapore - Delhi / Mumbai - Singapore - Brisbane. Sydney to Singapore was the only leg which had the newer style business class seats (which are good) although in seat power was not working for the entire duration of the flight. Each of the other legs were on dated planes with the older style business seats (not so great). Of particular concern was the Singapore - Brisbane flight where the seat and its surrounds were visibly dirty. My biggest gripe was the Mumbai - Singapore night time flight. Upon boarding the crew handed out menus and asked if I wanted to be disturbed to eat dinner - which I did after the atrocious Mumbai lounge experience (standing room only). Sure enough I fall asleep and wake up when tables are being set for dinner - I request my meal only to be told that they hadn't heated anything for me so I would just have to wait until after they had served everyone else. No offer of a drink or anything from the crew. Being a late night flight the idea of starting dinner 45 minutes after everyone else was not good. I ended up having to ask the crew to give me a bread roll and that the only food I got! Will never fly again.
2013-07-28,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated)."
2013-07-24,5,5,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN and return on A380. Flight from LHR was on time and all expected services on board. Economy seat in the main cabin on this leg of the flight was reasonable but a little cramped when compared to other airlines. Meal and beverage service was ok but ran out of choice for meal. Entertainment service was excellent. On the return leg with seat in upper deck felt slightly less cramped but seats not the most comfortable for long haul flight. Meal and beverage service was good. Entertainment system was ok programming constantly jerked and froze but was viewable. The disappointment with the flights was the baggage allowance which was small at 20kg when compared with other airlines which offer 32kg.
2013-07-24,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Recent return Perth - Singapore - (Munich) - Manchester economy. All flights on time exit seats on all flights good food and drinks as required. Excellent / helpful staff. What more could you really ask good old fashioned economy long may it continue. The 777's are showing age somewhat.
2013-07-24,7,7,Singapore Airlines customer review,Third time I have flown Singapore Airlines from Heathrow Intl to Changi Intl. My overall experience with them has always been satisfactory or above however there are a few issues. The appearance of the cabin is exceptional. Pleasant settings with artwork and during the festive season decorations above windows. I find the seats to be quite comfortable and have plenty of leg space in front of me. Staff are happy to help and are very pleasant. Now the negatives: I find compared with Qantas the in flight entertainment system to be limited. Generally there isn't a great deal of movies to choose from and the TV series they offer are rarely complete series only offering a few episodes. The food isn't that great if you're not a fan of eastern cuisine just wish they would offer a western option every now and then. Overall I would say its a close call between Qantas and SQ for economy and would say Qantas has the edge.
2013-07-22,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,"LHR-SIN. I couldn't book the open-jaw route I wanted on SQ's awful website so booked it as a codeshare with Virgin Atlantic which made online check-in impossible - VS site said the operating airline was someone else and SQ said the booking had been made through a different airline. I phoned VS and they were worse than useless SQ at least sympathised and the gent I spoke to said he would send a message to LHR requesting the seat I was hoping for. I was one of the last to check-in and indeed a window on the left had been saved for me so kudos for that. Boarding was OK although the cabin crew in my area didn't speak much English which complicated some pax requests for reseating. First meal service was OK lots of movies but not many good ones seat comfortable and managed some sleep. One reason I booked SQ was to enjoy an Asian style breakfast so you can imagine my frustration that despite distributing a lavish eight page printed menu to economy passengers which included three breakfast options (including a tasty-sounding pork and noodles exactly what I'd had in mind) they were only able to offer ""chicken sausage with frittata"" which was as disgusting as it sounds. Arrived on time and customs and baggage claim was pretty quick. Beyond being deposited at the destination safely and on time SQ fell short of expectations. Will not go out of my way to fly them again."
2013-07-22,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ232 30 JUNE SYD - SINGAPORE SQ366 1ST JULY SINGAPORE - ROME. Economy was ordinary on my flight Sydney to Rome. Sound quality from the headphones awful seat recline was terrible and the flight attendants gave dagger looks if you wanted a drink throughout the flight if it wasn't during meal service.
2013-07-22,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,Perth-Singapore-Perth in economy on refitted regional 777-200. Aircraft interior in excellent condition. Legroom was quite acceptable for what is only a 5+ hour flight. Flights in each direction were a breakfast time departure and we found the food to be very good with both the Western and Asian selections filling and tasty. Flights pretty much ran to time on departure and both arrived early. The onboard service was excellent on both flights with genuine smiles and attention. Just like the SQ of old. Happy to fly with them again.
2013-07-21,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,SQ25 from JFK to FRA on July 11 - A380 upper deck economy superb 2-4-2 vs 3-4-3 on main deck window seat - plenty of storage legroom fine (and I'm over 6ft) service very attentive and great menu selection for food/drinks. Nice and quiet for sleeping upstairs too. Hadn't flown SQ in 7yrs nothing different. Same solid airline that understands what good service is and how to deliver it. Surprised to read negative reviews about how they've dropped no evidence on that night.
2013-07-17,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) and SIN to BNE (SQ 235) on the B777-300ER and A330-300 respectively. Both flights were consistent in terms of food quality seat comfort and service. All of which were exceptional especially when compared to other leading airlines. The IFE was also commendable - updated with the latest movies and very user friendly.
2013-07-15,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,MEL-SIN return. Usually travel Business Class but tried Economy on this short trip. Overall impression was pretty good. Both flights were almost full but the crews were friendly and helpful and food service was quite slow but quality of the food was reasonable. Had a strange experience with the inflight entertainment system on both flights an English Language film suddenly lapsed into a version dubbed into some oriental language. Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick. Unable to check-in online for return trip due to more website problems but the standard check-in system at Changi was just excellent. Better than some Business Class check-in processes in fact.
2013-07-15,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,BCN to SIN (SQ 377) on 14 July 2013. Flight was excellent from the food to the IFE to the flight attendants. The FA's were always on-hand for any requests and were super friendly (hard to find in many airlines theses days).
2013-07-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,FRA to JFK and back. I am a frequent traveller and have been on more than 25 airlines so far. But Singapore airlines always exceeds my expectations! They serve food in economy that could easily be served in business classes of other carriers. The entertainment system is just great and the legroom is good. The great attitude of the friendly crews gives you the feeling that you are welcome onboard and that it is a pleasure for them to make you feel comfortable. This was my second time on Singapore Airlines and definitely not the last one!
2013-07-14,10,10,Singapore Airlines customer review,FRA-SIN and SIN-MEL in first. Excellent crews on both legs. Catering good the food seems always to be better out of Changi than out of Frankfurt in my opinion. Always a pleasure to fly SQ. Keep up the good work.
2013-07-14,9,9,Singapore Airlines customer review,LHR-SIN SIN-MEL. Great service from start to finish. The crew on the first leg were the most friendly and cheerful I've had on a flight even on a full flight and through very uncomfortable turbulence. The seats were good a little painful after 13 hours but the leg room (which is usually a major discomfort for me) was good for economy. Food was good not great but better than most. As with all airlines they need to make money but at least with Singapore Airlines you feel like a human being rather than cattle. Plus Changi airport is excellent which makes SA even more of a no brainier decision.
