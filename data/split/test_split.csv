7635,"Their warmth is world class They run their airline like their country. Quietly efficient. Check-in was quick, boarding was seamless and on-board overhead lockers are larger on their new aircraft. They tended to me pre-flight and served a delicious meal. If any passengers experienced discomfort with cabin pressure they'd alert the pilot and a more gradual lift/landing was exercised. I found the seats to be comfortable and roomy with a great selection of in-flight entertainment.",positive
4809,"Great service We began using Singapore Airlines the same year they began their service out of Houston IAH, and we have flown with them numerous times since. The service, even in economy, was great. You couldn’t ask for more. The cost of their flights are much more economical than other airlines flying the same route. Although we would prefer to fly into London, we cannot pass up on this flight because of the cost and the service. Try Singapore Airlines. You won’t be disappointed.",positive
9466,The omly way to fly. Great airline. On time and the flight crew were professional and courteous the entire long flight. Will fly them again.,positive
4657,Some Singapore Airline sectors have terrible service The flight service was pitiful both going and returning.  From the start the TV was not wotking.  My husband asked several times if they could correct this - he waited for hours and finally gave up and went to sleep.  The flight attendant then comes around a couple of hours into his sleep and wakes my husband up to let him know that the TV was working!!   They give us a menu for food choices and then told us that they had run out of our choice at the beginning of the flight!! Why bother to give a menu then?  Time came for drink orders and my husband asked for a brandy/cognac and got nothing.  He waited very patiently but had to remind them four times before they finally brought it.  We used the same airline from Delhi to Singapore and back - the service on those flights were fine.,negative
8661,"Stress free flight and excellent customer service before, during and after the flight. I've flown QANTAS (excellent), Etihad (great), Air New Zealand (average) and now Singapore Airlines overseas from Australia and all economy class.  I know there are loads of airlines out there that I haven't flown, but if I had to pick one right now to fly overseas, I'd pick Singapore Airlines.  We had a midnight flight that we missed (I had midnight of the next day in my head)! Despite booking with Opodo (which I don't think I'll ever do again, but that's another story) the Singapore Airlines customer service people couldn't have been more helpful.  Check in staff were cheerful and helpful at Tullamarine (there was an issue because one of the tickets hadn't been issued with a middle name) and during the flight both to Phuket and back, the onboard staff were professional and cheerful.  My husband also left his phone on the plane on the way over, which they found and delivered to our hotel's shuttle bus driver the next day when he went to pick up other guests.  I was very impressed with the whole trip and would highly recommend their economy class facilities.",positive
1085,"Changi has lost its way I recently transited through  Changi with Singapore airlines  (business class) .l have flown with Singapore airlines well over 40 times but something is now drastically wrong..
Changi terminal was a nightmare, everything was shut ,despite walking 2km through terminal 1 and 2 l couldn't find a coffee shop open at 9am.
Then l was forced to stand in line for over 30 minutes in sweltering temperatures (not adequately air conditioned) only to be herded though like animals. Obviously without adequate staff or screening facilities our flight was going to be delayed, well over half an hour. 
The flight was not much better. Why send staff around taking drink and food orders only for passengers to wait 30 /40 minutes to receive them.The food was terrible, nothing fresh,tasteless  ,in fact l was ill for a couple of days after the flight. 
So in summary my experience was so bad l won't be using Singapore airlines again.",negative
4476,"Loved the customer service! This is the first time on Singapore Airlines, the airplane we were on was apparently one of their newer ones. We booked Premium Economy, which allows you to choose your meals. They have tons of options and several for those with dietary restrictions. In between each meal you also get ""snacks"" which includes anywhere from chips to sandwiches! I had the bland meal and boy was it BLAND! I have a lot of stomach sensitivities so this worked for me, however many of the items I couldn't eat because I am also lactose. However, the portions you get are quite decent.

As someone mentioned as soon as you get seated you are given a hot towel to wipe your hands on. Each seat has a footrest (thank goodness), however when you use the footrest it doesn't leave you much space underneath the seat in front of you. The seating was two, four and two, then there are actually (at least what I saw) three seats in the back left that are individual seats which look pretty large. The flight looked to only have Business class and Premium Economy. 

There were tons of movies, shows and music on the flight to keep you busy. Each seat comes with a pillow, blanket and a set of ear phones. There is even a USB port hook up. For the night flight they even give each passenger a small toiletry bag that has socks, ear plugs, sleeping mask, and toothbrush/toothpaste. 

There are three bathrooms for the back of the plan and then two I believe for those in Business class, however I saw multiple people from my side and sneak in and use those bathrooms! 

I would say the only “complaint” I would have was trying to get out of the airplane, the Business class were sooooo slow and it took forever! Upside, when you board they have at least two different lines that allow people to go in. However, right as you line up to board they didn’t really call anyone in any specific order, it was more confusing coming back. 

Overall, we had a good flight, it was quick, staff is efficient, the plane was clean and the staff was extremely courteous!",positive

9262,"A great airline to travel with Most of the time, I am travelling with Cathay Pacific as Hong Kong being its hub which makes it more convenient than any other airlines. I was flying with SQ for a couple of times this year and it really impressed me. Service is no doubt on the top since you can always receive warm welcome on board and your request are fulfilled promptly. Seats are comfy on the new A350-900 and their entertainment choice is very updated. 

One thing I was not so happy with was the mile redemption that whenever it came to the issue that you needed to make any change, the only way was to call the hotline and it took like ,forever to be connected. Very inconvenient.",positive

8409,"Singapore Airlines A 380 Business Class from Singapore to Sydney From Check in at Changi Airport to Kris Flyer lounge to boarding the aircraft was seamless. My wife had walking disabilities and nothing was too much trouble for the ground staff and also the on board staff. After a meal the cabin crew showed my wife all the features of the Lie Flat bed, TV controls and kept checking on her health all night. Then at 5-00am in the morning for our 48th wedding anniversary a special cake and Teddy Bears for us. On arrival in Sydney the cabin crew ensured my wife was able to get from the aircraft to the wheel chair and right through immigration and customs!

3852,"Disappointing  After leaving our cruise ship in Tokyo, we flew to Melbourne via Singapore on Singapore Airlines. I had flown with this airline many years ago and thought that it was good, so I was disappointed by our recent experience of it. The Premium Economy seats were tighter than I expected them to be and, on one flight, the seat in front of me showed signs of poor upkeep. The meals served ranged between poor and scarcely edible. The attentiveness of the pleasant staff was the only saving grace. It will be a long time before I think about flying Singapore Airlines again.",negative

9538,"Trip to New Zealand with Singapore Airlines I used to work with Singapore airlines as a flight stewardess before having a kid. What I always love about this airline is that it is kid friendly, we are always provided with kids amenities and meals and usually the crew will even help warm the milk or clean the bottles for the parents. We were also taken care of during meal times where we can take turns to eat while the other watch the kid. The recent flight was good, the service was good even though I had a much better flight to auckland at the start of our trip, the crew was such an amazing team.

1233,"Utterly disgusted, discriminatory and prejudice Had a horrible nightmare experience traveling from Vancouver to Singapore with Air Canada (AC) and Singapore Airlines (SQ), supposedly Star “Alliance” partners. The first leg of my flight is YVR airport- HKG airport by AC and the 2nd leg of the flight is HKG-SIN by SQ. After queuing for 1.5 hours at Vancouver airport, I was informed by AC staff that I am not allowed to fly as they are unable to print out the flight tickets for SQ and Hong Kong’s airport transit criteria is to have both printed boarding passes. They brushed me off at the counter and told me bluntly to go purchase a new ticket that does not involve SQ or go fly with another airline. I repurchased the same route on AC for YVR-HKG right at the airport but with a 20 hours layover in Hong Kong flying my second leg with Cathay Pacific. For some bizarre reason, Star “Alliance” partners do not have the rights to issue tickets for their alliances but AC can issue a ticket for Cathay. 

To avoid a 20h layover, I contacted SQ and was advised to get another ticket for my second leg, the flight I was supposed to be on. To my horror in Hong Kong, not only did SQ not allow me to board with the new ticket that I repurchased under their advice, I was also made aware that there is a White male business class passenger flying the same original route that I was refused boarding with AC7 and SQ883. Would AC and SQ care to explain what’s with the prejudice? Is it due to racism or a flight class discrimination? Maybe sexism? 

As I thought my nightmare will be over, I looked at my baggage tag sticker and it reads AC7 and SQ883 not Cathay. After spending over 3 hours with the AC staff, he is still unable to locate it in Hong Kong and we had to file a missing baggage report. I left Hong Kong finally after 20 hours without knowing the location of my bag and if it went on the same Cathay flight as me. 

After the torturous 38 hours journey, I was informed in Singapore that my bag is still in Vancouver and they have no confirmation when it will be arriving. Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, they told me that there is no AC staff in Singapore and no one will deliver my bag to me while I am serving my quarantine, I had to send someone to the airport to pick it up for me. No word of concern if I have everything I need with me, no apologies nothing just AC faulting me again for their mistakes. 

My advice, if you are not a white male flying business/first class, do NOT travel with Air Canada and Singapore Airlines. 

Utterly disgusted.",negative
8486,"Only one criticism of our flight with Singapore Airlines on A380 The only criticism we have on both flights between Heathrow and Sydney is the poor quality headphones.  The sort you have to squash into your ears.

Other than that, the service is wonderful, the food quite adequate and good quality",positive

After spending 6 hours in hospital on an IV drip because I was unable to stop vomiting longer than 3 minutes I would think the least they would do is apologise? It’s really put me off flying with them next time I come to the UK",negative
945,"Generally excellent - but look out for small print I had booked Singapore Airlines from Sydney London return. ON 3 of my l;egs I got SQ with an A380 and everything was great. ON the way from Singapore to Sydney I got Scoot. BEWARE - never accept a Scoot operated flight when you have paid for SQ. You get no inflight entertainment. the food is inedible, and you even have to pay for an extra cup of tea. Leg room is terrible, they did not even give you a pillow and the head rest was not adjustable. All I could do on this packed flight was hope it landed OK and warn others about the situation, especially as I heard of a friend paying Premium Economy and getting Scoot. Seriously puts you off Singapore Airlines.",neutral
7147,"Uncomfortable seat and horrible food The business class seats are so uncomfortable and would not be suitable for someone of a larger size.

I ordered the Japanese set and it is so horrible tasting.  Rice and fish which is supposed to be served hot is lukewarm.  The portion is also so small.  I think this is the result of cost cutting.

SQ instead of improving with the rest of the competitors have lagged behind them now.",negative
7419,"Comfortable and on time Always satisfied with this airline.  Service is good, meals are good and planes are comfortable.

6670,"Enjoyable Night Flight We flew the night flight at 22.05 to Singapore then onto Adelaide....which I would really recommend if you all want to pass a few hours by sleeping...after about an hour we were served a meal..my husband had a veggie meal and I was surprised he ate it as he is so very fussy. The lights dimmed and we all settled down..me hubby and 14 year old...I bet we slept 5 hours. I wore a simple black eye mask and I really think I made a difference...we had cushions and blankets and were quite alright to say it was a economy. On waking we all just started watching the movies again and this passes time. The crew are friendly and are passing thru with water and juice. I did go up to the galley and they greeted mw lovely and offered me goodies...crisps,, chocolate bar , apple and more juice. we looked forward to breakfast as we knew we were nearly at Singapore....then we were all prepared for  our onward journey to Adelaide..which at just 7 hours flew by..again with Singapore Airlines. Would fly with them again.",positive

After flying many airlines (including, in recent times, Emirates and Qantas), I found that the crew on this flight were exceptional in their service. They apologised to me for delay with the meals...even though this was due to them giving exceptional service to those who had special dietary requirements. Many thanks to the flight crew  on SQ232 on 25 August from Sydney. I enjoyed the in flight entertainment, and did suggest to SA that they might consider perhaps some additional language lessons in addition to the Spanish lesson provided as part of the in flight entertainment (perhaps Mandarin, Cantonese, and even Malay - wonderful to know to give some respect to the wonderful people of Singapore and Malaysia). Ten points to you all.",positive

2342,"Their tenacity at absolute safety was good to see and experience. Singapore Airlines continues to be one of the best airlines.
In fact the return part of our journey was from Amsterdam, Singapore for a stopover, then onto Brisbane.
The flight over was by far the best experience, the food was great, and so was the service.
Sadly on the return journey, there were just a couple of minor hiccups with their serving of food, ie not getting a cup of coffee until there second time around of asking, and then getting totally forgotten for a meal, which was quickly rectified after I pressed the call button.  
Overall, I love flying with Singapore Airlines. Due to no fault of their own, leaving Amsterdam late, but we arrived earlier than scheduled in Singapore, and they do ensure that you are always made to feel welcome.",positive
9150,"Good but not the level I expected given this airlines ratings WLG-SIN via MEL.  Its one of their older 772’s in the previous regional configuration.  Suffice to say a bit tired and the seating, while perfectly adequate, falls well short of their current business class standard.  That said the convenience of departing from Wellington makes up for it.  Service and food very good but the entertainment options were, in my view, somewhat limited.
SIN-CDG.  A380.  Surprised at the seats which I found uncomfortable when in a sitting configuration.  OK however as they were good as a bed and this was a night flight.
Again service and food very good though entertainment once again limited - I did not even bother as literally nothing appealed.  No movies worth the effort and only two documentaries.     
Check in very efficient and both aircraft kept clean.",positive

 strangely on some flights far too much food - on the return they quickly ran out of two of the good meals :-( 
One problem is the foot rests  - they are on the side of the back of the seat in front, meaning one cannot sit straight but has to organsie himself to use the foot rest, rather than recline the seat for the seat foot rest to come up - Bad design.

378,"Singapore airlines poor communication being trying to get a refund/credit for an unused  flight for over a year! I can see from the reviews that Singapore airlines is not what it used to be in terms of customer service and communication they are atrocious!
been trying to get a refund for over a year since March 2022.
1st of all they changed my flight so I said i can not use that flight tried several times on the website to comminicate about it and it was so difficult and response times up to 15 days! finally I had to go to Jakarta to a Singapore airlines office to speak to someone. They acknowledged and accepted my claim but said I can just call to make a new flight resevation at a later date. During that time trying to speak to someone over the phone was impossible. Huge wait times I mean over an hour. I gave up. This year I requested a refund and I received an email saying I would get the refund within 6 weeks? this is after a year had gone by. Still waiting for the refund 6 weeks late no confirmation it had been refunded. I wrote again notifying the airline my email address had changed which I did through the Singapore airlines FF portal on the website. you have to go through a security text message to verify its you to do this. Then I get another email saying they need to verify who I am  and I need to send all the information again. OMG sooo Frustrating! Still waiting! I am wrting this review because of my frustration. I will not use this airline agian and want to warn others about my experience. This was business class flight & I am a Gold star alliance member. This is totally unacceptable as an airline and if there is a consumer complaints portal in Singapore I would love to know who to submit my complaint to about Singapore airlines.",negative

We thought we were flying in the A380 but no luck.  It was a A 350 or similar and the seat pitch was pathetic !  My husband was so crammed in he couldn’t move.  Luckily I asked around and found a spare seat elsewhere so we were marginally more comfortable.  The seating was definitely very uncomfortable.",neutral
3758,"Great service but uncomfortable seating The service and professionalism of the staff was excellent. Good choice of meals that were well presented and tasty. 
The one problem for me was the seating. Despite possibly being the largest seat I have experienced across different airlines in Business Class it was easily the most uncomfortable. The only way to sit with my feet up or lay down was to have my feet raised at a 45 degrees angle to the side (rather than straight in front) to fit down a ‘hole’ in the side of the seat in front. This meant that there was very little room to move my legs and required sitting/sleeping at an angle in the chair with my back across the corner - all very uncomfortable, especially in a long flight and overnight on the return journey. 
So, sadly, despite the rest of the experience being excellent (especially the staff) I would not fly on a Singapore Airlines flight with this seating configuration again.",neutral

371,"Singapore Air: Not Overrated! Just completed the 18 hour+ flight from Newark International Airport to Singapore. I have travelled from the States to Singapore many times, but have previously flown via United from Newark to San Francisco, and then SFO to Singapore. I decided to try the nonstop flight just to have the experience. Overall, it was as good as an 18- hour flight can be. Sitting in business class with the flat-bed seats was certainly worth the cost. The food was delicious and the movie selection was outstanding. I watched five movies (all recent releases), and as a result was throughly entertained for the first 9-10 hours of the flight. When I finally decided to go horizontal, the flight attendant helped to convert the seat into a bed and I was reasonably comfortable; my only complaint is that the flat bed configuration requires that you sleep on an angle, and there isn't a lot of room to maneuver on the bed. When you want to switch positions, you feel like you are on a rotisserie. However, the plus factors greatly outweigh the inconvenience of not being able to truly sleep comfortably when you are a very tall person. I also like the fact that the flight arrives into Singapore about 5:00pm, and during the summer--this is a plus (at least for me), since it is still daylight in Singapore and I felt that I had a few hours to be active before I crashed.  I don't think I will ever say that I am looking forward to a 18-hour nonstop flight, but if you have to fly from the US east coast to Singapore, it is the best way to go.",positive

We were airborne by 21.55. We were informed that the actual time would be 2 hours and 20 minutes flyingtime. We actually landed at  00.10, which was good news as our connecting flight to London was departing at 01.10. 

About 45 minutes into the flight food and drinks were served, the food option was fish and potatoes or chichen and rice. 

We opted for the chicken, it looked uappetising in fact it was disappointingly awful and was not eaten.

I had ordered ahead online as gluten free and the staff checked/confirmed this at the start of the flight and then served all allergens first, all labelled and coded to the allergen. I got a really gold meal, a tomato and vege chicken dish, salads, veg, GF breads. I was really impressed, for ‘plane food’ it wasn’t half bad - again certainly better than other companies.

The meals served were outstanding and we enjoyed the personalised meal service. The seats were ultra spacious and had more than sufficient leg room.

In flight entertainment wasn’t the best and the latest but well, still acceptable. The headsets blocked out most of the cabin noise and that was awesome because we could have a comfortable and “quiet” flight throughout.",positive
1112,"Cancelled leg but no followup Bought a business class ticket from Copenhagen to Darwin with a short 2 hours transit in Singapore. Singapore Airlines changed it to a FOUR DAYS stop over in Singapore.
Of course this is unacceptable. But you can't get a hold of anyone at customer service. I have called multiple times (waited up to 2 hours on the phone). They don't respond to your emails.  
You can't change the flights online, you can't cancel. Basically only option is to accept the change. And then what? Sleep in Singapore airport for four days straight? Flying out beginning of April. I still hope someone will have contacted me by then but I am starting to loose hope.",negative

58,"Using miles for flights I wanted to express my frustration regarding the difficulties I've encountered while attempting to redeem miles for flight tickets with Singapore Airlines .

I've consistently faced challenges with the redemption process, often finding myself placed on waitlists for flights. Furthermore, on multiple occasions, approximately two weeks before the scheduled flight, I've received notifications of cancellations, despite my repeated attempts to secure bookings. This uncertainty and last-minute cancellations have greatly inconvenienced me.

Compounding the issue, despite my efforts to utilize my miles within the required timeframe, I've faced expiration of my miles due to these ongoing challenges. As a loyal customer, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and discouraged from further engagement with Singapore Airline.

I urge you to review and address the issues within your miles redemption system to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience for your customers. Your attention to these matters would greatly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.",negative
897,"You pay $10,000 for a flight on ANY other airline and … You are on board 45 minutes before takeoff, you are settling in either to do work or to go to sleep because you have precious little time, and you are not besieged with a fully mask policy.  Not here.   

And you are suffocating with masks in a stuffy hot waiting area (and on board). These non-N95 masks do little to prevent anything (half the meetings I just had in Singapore had locals who were suffering from COVID, but I it had been a while since someone in my US world was sidelined).  Further, do the epidemiological work of looking at how hyper clean airplane environments provide cleaner air than anything, except perhaps for 100% wearers of N95 masks—and even that is not clear (and, BTW, look around at all the people who are constantly pretending to eat and drink to avoid wearing a mask—who then really believes that masks are doing anything). 

This is probably a good—maybe great—airline for coach. But for people who pay premium, LET ME OUT of the COVID theater that somehow forgot about the people who pay a little bit extra. 

And BTW, I am a liberal Democrat who happens to be a fact-based scientist who realizes we need to find a balance between living and an hyper-controlled environment that has kept me from even getting a common cold in the last 3 years.",negative

I have to say they are one of the most professional airlines I have had the pleasure of flying with! The Airline  stewards are always there to help and are always gracious and go about there job in a professional manner. 
The flight is long with a three hour stopover in Singapore and there is lots to see st the Airport and you can stretch your legs as there is a lot of walking as it’s so big!
Unfortunately on my return there was a baby which cried for most of the journey and this is an issue with any airline but they gave out earplugs to relieve the noise !

354,"Pre Covid ..The Best  //  Post Covid .. An Expensive Mistake Pre Covid.  The A380 Suites are superb. The crew are attentive but discreet. As  regular 1st Class travelers, my wife and I would not dream of flying with anyone else.  The 777 flight Auckland to Changi is OK, the private room is a bonus while we wait for our next flight to Paris CDG on SQ's A380.  The suites and service 'WERE' incomparable. 
Mid Covid (June 2020). The A350 used on the Changi - CDG leg was frankly a disgrace.  It was old, tatty and dirty.  The crew were at their usual best.  The seat was uncomfortable and in need of new upholstery. This aircraft was a salute lesson on how to disappoint a customer.  However, we blame Covid.
Post Covid (June 2021 and 22).  Same awful aircraft, nothing has changed. Crew are still superb though. The purser on board whispers to me that lots of passengers are complaining.

6348,"Amazing Premium Economy--SQ is amazing I flew round trip from NYC JFK to DEL via SIN and tried their premium economy product.  It is an exceptional well thought thru.  The seats are on the A380 in the 2-4-2 layout on the main deck and are wider than economy. 

Check in:- The SQ check in was smooth and quick---being Star Alliance Gold and Premium Economy allowed a Business Class check in and they gave the lounge pass right away both in JFK in the outbound and DEL in the inbound.  The JFK lounge is the Swiss lounge and it was small and crowded with minimal food offerings but the coconut chicken curry and swiss chocolates were good.  Frankfurt had the Lufthansa Senator Lounge and Air Canada Maple leaf lounge which accept Singapore and both were good.  The Changi lounge is a disappointment was SQ does not let Star alliance Gold members use the Silver Kris lounge but a much stepped down Star Alliance lounge.  The Delhi lounge is amazing ( see photos attached) in space and gastronomy.

The boarding of the plane was orderly in all 6 sectors.  They right away offered a drink and hot towel.  Champagne offered was good oubound and disappointing on the way back.  The seat is very comfortable and spacious.  It is the old First Class seat on US domestic flights and it reclines quite a bit while also having a thigh support and leg rest along with reading light.  The only downside is Premium Economy passengers have to use the Economy toilets.  The drinks, nuts were offered right after take off.  I had the flight attendand make me the ""Singapore Sling""- an iconic gin cocktail invented in Singapore's Raffle Hotel--SQ offers it as a special national symbol.

The meal selection was excellent--I had used the ""Book the Cook"" option which is different from the menu--the ""Nasi Lemak Singaporean Meal;"" , ""Dimsums"" and ""Shrimp with Ginger Sauce and Rice"" options were finger licking good.  Desserts were ice cream or chocolate cake in different sectors.

After some difficult financial years, I started flying with “normal” airlines again..........
Many flights we AirAsia, Lion Air, Jetstar.
My first flight with Singapore Airlines, after 4 years felt like a warm bath.
To be treated like a guest, from the moment you book until you leave the plane at your destination.
We should all should have the possibility to experience this.
Traveling must be comfortable, welcoming and  give you the feeling of respect. 
Singapore airlines always offer you this experience.
On this moment I’m waiting for my flight from Surabaya to Singapore and I’m looking forward to “board”. 
What a huge difference with all Budget airlines, where flying becomes a way to move from point A to point B. Not a experience you look forward too.
And the price? If you book a 2 way ticket and you want to bring some luggage the prices are very competitive.
We all want to fly safe and feel welcome.
Wish you all safe travels and thanks to Singapore airlines for having me as a guest.

While I would usually pride myself on absolute neutrality and write reviews that run the gamut, I have to warn and admit that I live in Singapore and might be slightly biased by our fantastic airport and many fond memories of taking the early-morning Frankfurt-New York flight years ago on many occasions. That being said, and notwithstanding a slight drop in food quality, Singapore Airlines delivers. Friendly service, best entertainment system, modern planes such as the Airbus 350 on some long-distance flights and reliable and fast for the quick Singapore-Saigon hop I often frequent. They also don't cheat on the customer service - having experienced one 5-hour delay in my many years of flying SIA, I was compensated fairly and swiftly.

4286,"Above and beyond! Singapore airlines went above and beyond to help us at a very difficult time. 2 weeks into a 5 week holiday my brother suddenly died. At the time we were in the UK and were supposed to travel to Europe in 2 days time for the European leg of our holiday and were supposed to fly home from Berlin. We phoned SA in London to explain the situation and asked what our options were. SA asked what we wanted to do and we explained that we wanted to get home to Australia as soon as possible. They then proceeded to find the first available flights for the next day so that we could get home and swapped our original return flights from Berlin to return flights from Manchester. When I asked about the price difference they said that they would waive the fee. Months ago when we booked our original flights I booked gluten free meals for my husband as he is a Celiac and were told that he would not be able to get gluten free meals due to the short notice which we understood and were totally fine with so we packed some food for him so that he could eat on board. However when we boarded the flight and spoke to the flight attendant regarding our situation he gave my husband first choice of suitable meals and even phoned Singapore to ensure that gluten free meals were on board for my husband for the second leg of the journey home.

Probably it only applies to First Class.

First of all, inflight meals of economy class were terrible.  And I’m trying to reclaim my miles of my flight from SFO to YVR. (I booked that flight on SQ official homepage), Air Canada is the Star Alliance and SQ partner.
The first stfaff (VK) replied me that “we will not be able to add miles for your Air Canada flight”.
He has no knowledge that Air Canada is SQ partner.
I  told him that Air Canada is SQ partner airline and shows him a screenshort of my my KrisFlyer account,  the claim missing miles page shows AC (Air Canada) is SQ airline partner and is able to choose to claim for missing miles.
Then the 2nd staff asked me to attach all the documents to reclaim my miles. 
I’m still dealing with them and so far they have all different staff to reply me. (Aleady dealed with four different staff already).

Premium economy was a small cabin (24 seats) but there was not much to suggest this class and the massive upcharge over economy. The seat recline was quite clever (A350) in that on full recline it slide so as not to encroach too much on the passenger space behind.  The noise cancelling headphones were effective and the entertainment screen was larger than in economy with a very good selection of films, music, TV etc. but there was not other amenity except a bottle of water. 

You could 'book a cook' which expanded the food selection considerably (mainly Asian cuisine though) but nearing midnight, who can face a meal? There were two full service meals. We only had the second one and it was acceptable.

The cabin crew did the bare minimum and hid away for much of flight. However, when called, they responded quickly and politely. The wearing of masks did not help their cause, it was difficult to understand them and it felt like a medical flight!

The lavatories deteriorated over the length of the flight and things like paper towels etc were poorly managed.

5186,"Fading Glory Singapore Airlines used to represent the epitome of air travel, or at least business class travel. And while it is still an elite airline, a recent flight from SFO to Bangalore (BLR) via Singapore bore out how the airline has slipped in recent years.

First, the good: the new A350 we flew nonstop from SFO to SIN (16:40)  is just, simply, a beautiful airplane. The flat-bed seats (more like beds that seats) and the impeccable service were also marvelous. 

What has slipped considerably is the quality of the food. As a frequent international business class traveler, the quality of food on other carriers such as United (yes, United) is better. (What keeps United business class mired in mediocrity is the unpredictability of its flight attendant service, which can range from inspired to downright rude. But -- for another review). Singapore's food has never been its strength, and it has slipped from there. Gloppy, tasteless noodle soup, rubbery chicken not worthy of what is served in coach, tough steak, and a selection of mediocre wines.

Yes, these are first-world problems, and to the average traveler this sounds like privileged whining. But at business class prices ($5K and up per person), lousy food on a 17 hour flight is enough to drive our business to other carriers who are (no pun intended) eating Singapore's (lousy) lunch…!",positive

Besides the fit-out of the business class cabin, the Service by the attendants was exceptional. After we boarded and sat down, my 5 year old son asks me ‘why is everybody so nice here’ (referring to the attendants). 
For a 5 year old to raise this question just shows how lovely and polite the attendants are. Even greeting me by my name every single time. 

The meals were great as well and there was a wide variety of onboard entertainment.

The plane was very new and clean, however leg room was not great and the seat felt a little bit small. Food was okay but i noticed the meal sizes have gone smaller since i traveled with them back in 2016. The in flight entertainment system is good but internet is not free. Have used internet services free of charge with different airlines, however i would recommend Singapore Airlines to any one. They got my tick of approval",positive
6776,"Very Good, but perhaps not as good as expected We had very high expectations about going business  on Singapore Airlines on a long distance flight. Having read reviews about service etc. Outbound we were on a 777-300 which had very good seats with good storage space for ""things"". Return was on a A380 that was nearly empty and 4.5 hours delayed due to problems with a generator on one of the engines. Seats were very wide with plenty of space (Old business class seats ?) but there was really lack of storage space for books, glasses etc.
Foot was very good as one should expect on a business class flight. Vine selection good. Return flight being a day-flight was kept with windows close during all flight. Not sure why. We arrived at Heathrow early evening so keeping it dark did not in my case help on my jet-lag.",positive
9900,"Top notch I flew Singapore AL on an Asian round trip through Bangkok and Singapore, and the quality of service on board was simply excellent.  Unfortunately I have to fly regularly with the consistently poor British Airways on one of their monopoly routes, so the contrast was even greater. 

On the long haul flights to and from Singapore, I was fortunate to fly on aircraft with their 'old' business class seating, which is quite a bit more spacious than their new style, which I experienced on one of their 787s between Bangkok and Singapore.

But the real difference is the attentiveness and personal quality of their service.  Nothing is too much trouble, and they really bend over backwards to make the flight as comfortable and pleasant as possible.  British Airways should send all their Customer Managers on a crash course with either SIA or Thai to see how it should be done.",positive
8304,Best Service in the Sky. Had a most wonderful flight with exceptional service from the cabin crew led by Colin Stuart.He also confirmed for me that my checked bags would go to my final destination even though on a separate airline. This put me at ease as I had not flown this route before.,positive
7900,"“GREAT SERVICE – GREAT AIRLINE.” We had good reports about Singapore airline and we were no disappointed.  We had a return flight to Singapore from London – in economy class. 
From the time we bordered the 300-380 aircraft, the service was ‘brilliant’. Helpful and Cheerful stewards. A good amount of space for an economy seat. The food was good with a printed menu from which to choose. 
The staff  [including the male stewards] had a really good empathy with children who were on board.  

I would travel with this airline again.",positive
6120,"Offensive experience of a new launch without respect  New evening flight to Singapore from Johannesburg and the day I flew was the launch. If I had known this I wouldn’t have flown on that day. Checked in myself and had my e-boarding passes so went through to their partner lounge and we were notified by lounge attendants that boarding was taking place. Went to the boarding area to find a camera crew, various publicity people and no boarding taking place at all. While waiting they were interviewing people, having a raffle and waited for another 30 minutes while music blasted out of speakers. When it came time to board they started filming people boarding without any consent from me. I was so enraged I had to let them know they were offensive and needed my permission to film me. The gentleman checking Business Class in did apologize and asked them to stop filming but this made me feel like I was in a freak show. The experience on board to start with continued to disappoint me when I was served orange juice with alcohol in it, which I don’t drink, the meat starter and I am a vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian meal! What has happened to this airline that I used to love and respect? Not a fan anymore.",negative
9445,"Disappointing flights We were disappointed with our Flight from Melbourne to  Barcelona and return. The food was only average, we were not given a travel pack, only socks and eye shade and the seats were not very comfortable. We felt we were not treated any differently from economy class passengers- needing to ask for help to set up our bed  - which was not easy. The bed was very uncomfortable and you had to lie at an angle as the section for your feet is set off to one side. When we arrived home we had very sore hips and backs from the poorly designed bed. The other complaint we had was that the Business Class lounge at Barcelona was appalling - overcrowded, worn out seating and very little food. It was a shared lounge and was full of Flight staff and their luggage! We did write to the airline with our issues and they responded quickly and offered us vouchers to spend at their at their Flight shop - which we appreciated.",neutral
164,"Poor service, no refund for seats re-allocation Singapore Air was good years ago, not anymore. We bought tickets with prepaid seats. A month before flying Singapore Air changed our seats without paying a refund. It is unclear what we paid for if seats can be changed by Singapore Air without giving our money back. 
Service was very average.
We will avoid flying with Singapore Air in future.",negative
9214,"Totally Relaxed If you have the money business class is the only way to travel.  Access to The Lounge provides great opportunity to refresh after a long flight.  The in flight service is second to none. Seats that recline to a flat bed together with complimentary slippers,  blanket and pillow make for an enjoyable flight and you will arrived totally fresh and ready to start you holiday experience.  Make sure you take advantage of the online menu ordering for a spectacular feast. I highly recommend Singapore Airlines.",positive
8317,"Food not good Was not that impressed with Singapore airlines

1090,"Will ruin your trip Went to Maldives with a transit flight via Singapore. First of all, they put us on scoot airways for the first flight, which appeared to be a budget version of Singapore airlines. The plane was old, had no in flight entertainment and was definitely not singapore airlines. Then after being put on a singapore airlines flight for the 2nd part of the journey, to our horror our baggage never made it to the Maldives. We put in a baggage tracking support ticket, went to our resort and waited for 2 days. We had to stay at our resort with nothing but the clothes on our back for two days. Eventually we learned that our luggage had been put on to a flight to Sri Lanka. How the f*** do airline staff do something so stupid? Then instead of sending it direct to Maldives from Sri Lanka, they put it back on a flight to singapore. We received no apology, no compensation and the customer support is impossible to contact. This airline is not worth any chance no matter how good a deal the flight tickets are.

Apparently the resort staff also said that it is not uncommon for singapore airlines to lose your luggage too. So yeah definitely avoid.",negative
7700,"Quality, legroom and baggage allowance The extra legroom compared to some carriers gave comfort, the quality of service, food and entertainment was impressive and the baggage weight allowance removes the headaches when packing. First time flown SA and thoroughly recommend them. Good number of staff at Heathrow to help, great Changi Airport was a breeze for plane change. Note, you are screened again at the gate - reassuring.",positive
6321,"This has good reviews and they are well deserved! We were so fed up with substandard travel we decided to try Singapore Airlines even though it meant travelling to Manchester. Incredibly it was cheaper even after paying train fares and one night in an hotel! The booking system was easy and straightforward, the checking in on line the same, and choice of seats was so easy for us. Once we got to handin in our luggage the staff again were so helpful and made the suggestion to change our seat so we would have three seats to use for the two of us. Passing through security and into the departures was a cinch, We were welcomed on to the aircraft by beautifully turned out crew, who were so welcoming and helpful. The plane was clean and smart, the entertainment system easy to manage. We were offered water/orange juice so regularly throughout the trip, and the food was glorious, a choice between European and eastern. Nothing was too much trouble and they remembered everything they said they would do. I can't recommend them enough, and will be flying with them in the future, wherever possible.",positive

9640,Good in parts We have flown Singapore airlines for many trips now and always been happy with the service.  Don't know what happened this time but it wasn't quite up to scratch.  On the way to Singapore my husbands connecting flight (Canberra to Sydney) was cancelled on about 9 occasions which was both frustrating and time consuming.  We paid additional money to travel premium economy on the way to Singapore - it was very good and worth the money. Staff were friendly and food was good and plentiful and the additional space in the seats made it comfortable.  On the return journey from Singapore to Sydney however we were in economy and there was a limited amount of food.  The flight left at 7.30am and we did not eat at the airport.  Breakfast on the plane was a bread roll and a container of juice. There didn't seem to be enough staff and those that were there seemed tired and over it (they probably were).  It just didn't seem to be up to their normal standard.,neutral

After 30 minutes arguing with the person in charge I was told to do an upgrade online ( paying for it!!) dear Singapore airlines people: not everything is money and you have disappointed a very loyal customer.",negative

Tea coffee & lights out for a hopefully long snooze. The staff encourages you to drink plenty of water to keep hydrated & are extremely caring. You can request a snack at any time during the flight.

2615,"Singapore bound A380 business class Having always wanted to fly in an A380, I got my chance on this trip to Singapore (my end stop being Bali). I found the Singapore lounge in London Heathrow was of good size, with plenty on offer and friendly staff. The seating saw spacious and comfortable! The view was not the greatest as there was a lot of construction going on outside, but you could still see flights coming and going as you sipped and pecked at the numerous bites on offer. 
Upon entering the upper floor of the A380, you are amazed at the sheer amount of business class seats that are laid out along the entire upper floor (apart from the small number of 1st class pods that were on offer at the upper front cabin). 
The business class seating I chose was a window seat. With a seating arrangement of 1 - 2 - 1 with the two Center seats having the ability to transform into a double bed, should you need it! 
The seats were wide, with ample storage all around. The entertainment system was more than ample for my 13 hour flight with more to watch than you could watch on a round the world trip or two. The screens are large touch sensitive screens. 
Besides the blanket/pillow and cushion there are plenty of other items for your comfort at your seat like a set of quality noise cancelling headphones and the usual items like flight socks, sleeping eye covers etc with more items available in the lavatories (shaving kits etc).
The cabin crew were all very attentive and called you by name (which I found a very nice touch). Pre departure drinks in hand after hot towels was just a sample of what was to come!
Being up in the upper deck of the A380 I found it a strange experience barrelling down the runway from such a different perspective before the feeling of being launched with the grace of a majestic Swan into the air and the effortless climb into the blue where our outbound route around London guided us towards our final direction. Up up we climbed and before we knew it we were levelling our in a cruise.
For the entire flight I felt completely taken care of. There was such a selection of food and drink that just seemed to come, just at the right time. From a drinks menu and food menu you were not left wanting. 
The seats were lie flat seats, if you wanted to sleep or just take a snooze. 
If I could say anything negative about the flight it would have to be the lack of grasper air over head! There were no air vents overhead! There were moments that I felt a little warm, but had no means to cool down (except for a cool glass of water). 
Would I fly again with Singapore airlines? The simple answer is yes!
Singapore airways service is very punctual! The crew were ever so helpful and attentive, and I enjoyed every minute.",positive
4445,"Excellent airline! We found the crew staff to be very friendly and obliging. The plane it self was comfortable, well as comfortable as you can get in economy class flying long distance.

They provide a mini-pillow and a sheet.",positive
4073,"Reliable and comfortable Singapore Airlines in my opinion is always reliable and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is also good. Not as much variety as some other airlines but good enough. Seat spacing was average. It was quite cramped. Meals to and from Perth also left a lot to be desired. The menu as well as taste of food was very average. Didn't receive any drink service on the way to Perth. However, from Perth drinks were served separately. The kids meal was excellent, both times. Toilets were quite clean and the crew were doing clean ups in between. Service was slightly indifferent. I would recommend this airline because flight was on time both times, the journey was comfortable, aircraft was clean and well maintained and there were no major pain points at any time.",positive

But we changed seats among use 6 so, that was a real big problem for the staff. we had to change seats before we where given the meals!

239,"A step backwards I am writing this review because we travelled on from Singapore on an aircraft which had the older Singapore Airlines's business class seats and what a difference they are from the new ones. Wide, comfortable, plenty of places to store items, a solid table and a wide area in which the stretch legs.  The new seats are a step backwards as the seat was hard and uncomfortable, the table a folding affair, apart from a pocket near the legs which can't be accessed when the seat is in the lying position, there is nowhere to put items and the area to position legs is so narrow that it is only possible to lie on one side or on the back.  The cabin crew, as always, were the very best but why change the seat design from one which was one of the best?",neutral

Fantastic and professional service throughout the flight. Hot towels were distributed at the start of the flight, followed shortly by a drink and meal service. Stewardesses were quick to respond when the call light was on and services were provided quickly.

Entertainment system was touch screen and stocked with a wide variety of the latest films, tv series, music, podcasts and games. Toilets were clean.

At approximately 200 USD for a return flight during promotions, it is no wonder why Singapore Airlines remain the number one choice for casual and business travellers alike!",positive

7002,"Always A Positive Experience I always find 10+ hour trips to be tiring and not the most pleasant.  However, my return trips on Singapore Airlines were much easier thanks to the service and quality of flying with this company.  The flight attendants work hard but are very polite and friendly and provide excellent service.
I paid for extra legroom seats as I find it easier to sleep this way and another benefit is that I was seated across from two lovely flight attendants during the take-offs and landings.  Note that if you opt for this legroom option the entertainment systems need to be put away during those times.
I always prefer to fly with Singapore Air if possible.",positive

6028,"I Would Travel this airlines even if we never touched down. It is a LONG WAY from LAX to Singapore. But if you have to be in an airplane for 17 hours count yourself blessed to travel via Singapore airlines. I did have the luxury of traveling Business Class, but 17 hours is still 17 hours. The flight crew were so friendly and attentive. I even received a little Singapore AirlinesTeddy Bear when they found out I was going to be a grandma. 

The seats were superb. The crew made the bed for me when I was ready to take a nap. Lying recumbent on the seat was very comfortable. Only draw back was the leg cubby. It was small and restrictive. If you can, choose the bulkhead seats which offer double the leg room when in lying position. 

And choose the Book the Cook menu. There are many more choices available. You must do this in advance of your flight. 

If you have a choice for your final destination, I highly recommend Singapore Airlines.",positive

Most was good for airline food.  Wine for meals was included. We sat in bulkhead seats which provided plenty of legroom but weren't as convenient when it comes to using the entertainment system or having a place to put your things - phone, book etc.  The entertainment system worked well and had an excellent selection of movies, TV shows, music, games.

If its not for my frequent flyer with skyteam, I would any time choose Singapore airlines. Of cos sq is abit more pricey compare to Vietnam airlines. But recently Vietnam airlines up their fares in recent year. Will consider not taking vn if the fares goes any higher

Comparing both these full service airlines sq win hands on.
Service during flight, remembering ur name, smile, friendliness etc. Vietnam airlines can't beat the sq flight crews. 

On ground service wise. If u are on biz class, sq lounge is way better.

In term of support, vn definitely out. As a lotus platinum tier members, I never receive any lug tag, renew tier letter or even the member card. Can't be bother to ask anyway. 

Sq ground, support etc is good. Any changes via sms n email etc. Vn on the other hand, like to change plane type, schedule or even cancel flight, and they will just email a few days in advance. I actually miss connection once cos of their flight delay and landed close to midnight, and miss the next sector connect,  and don't bother to apologize just issue u a next day 6am flight. No hotel offer. Nothing.  theres another time, reach airport and get  to know they email 2 days before my fliggt and put me on an early flight, I miss the flight.

Anyway, maybe I fly more with vn and tendancy to get more of the sh*t . . haha.

Check in was a breeze and we were soon on our way to the United Polaris Club at SFO (No Silver Kris Lounge any more at SFO). I took a hot shower, changed into comfortable clothing for our long flight, and joined my wife for breakfast. We were greeted at the door of the aircraft by the very friendly Singapore flight crew who escorted us to our seats in the beautiful Business Class cabin. We soon had a welcoming drink in hand (a mimosa) as we explored our seats and the extraordinary variety of entertainment options. The cabin is very comfortable and quiet. Within an hour after takeoff from SFO, we were served our dinners which had been pre-selected through Singapore's ""Book the Cook"" option. The appetizer, entrée (NY steak with asparagus, carrots), and dessert (a wonderful mango pana cotta) were all delicious. Mid way through the flight, I had the Chinese chicken stir fry (again, delicious). Finally, prior to arrival, a final light snack was served. This was the longest flight we've ever taken anywhere at 16 hours 45 minutes.

Missing the last star in this review however due to the following.
The red wine selection seemed to have slipped, the return trip a month later still had the same entertainment already previously viewed on the way there and lastly the Changi business lounge is getting far too overcrowded when it gets to the point where 3 people cannot fit a spot to sit together. 
Oh, another useful tip. Their partner airline SAS do NOT give you an empty seat in the middle of 3 in business as most other European short business flights between countries do. They put 3 passengers in a row together and you need to move yourself after takeoff.",positive
1307,"Trip to Australia This is a lovely airline, the stewardesses in their neat uniform cannot do enough for you, and their smiles are so sweet.

My wife is semi- disabled and we asked for the full assistance, so when you get to Singapore Airport on stopover on the way out, unless you ask for it, your own wheelchair goes to the next flight with your luggage. This is ok, but, you get taken in one of their wheelchairs to a drop off area inside the vast flat very large terminal which houses all 4 terminals, and dumped. I could have gone to get coffee visit toilet etc, but my wife was stranded for 90 minutes. The nearest shops were 50 yards away, unaccessible to her. The only up side is that when its time to board your next flight you get taken by someone who knows where they're going and when you reach your gate they push through everybody else to get to the front with me following behind going, 'sorry, sorry', to people. the trick is to ask for your wheelchair back at Singapore and it arrives out of the hold in a nice big plastic bag, so you can explore the large terminal and shops to your hearts content, there is even a smoking room 'inside' near the butterfly area-which is very hot!",positive
593,"Terrible after support / customer service (operational) I have been a loyal customer of SIA, albeit I am not a frequent flyer as such, but every year for many years (apart from Covid) i have flown a multi itinerary trip from UK down to Australia and back again inc using their code share partners within Australia (Virgin). I lso fly business class every trip.  This year I can for sure say the non-flight customer service aspect of the company has degraded considerably. I have tried to make changes to dates only, and its been like pulling teeth! Firstly I attempted to change a MEL - PER flight with Virgin Australia as it was on an SIA ticket, They advised there was no seats available however on the Virgin website there was dozens of seats throughout the day. I ended up cancelling the flight (without any refund might I add) and having to pay $1200 for a one way trip to Perth! Now in Perth I am trying to simply change my PER-SIN flight by 5 days and my SIN - CDG flight by 6 days. THREE days ago I made the request and the outbound is due tomorrow, and STILL they cannot give me pricing! Furthermore,  do not understand why as I booked the seat 100% on SIA website that I cannot cannot make simple changes like this on their website. Instead I have to call their beyond useless call centre and each time I can be on the phone for over and hour. My request is so simple...... just a date change only! What is so difficult?? 
Sadly having always been extremely loyal to SIA for this yearly trip, I will now likely use middle eastern airlines, as I have never had any issues with their customer service, and flight changes are pretty simple. My experience is with Emirates and Qatar Airlines. 
SIA need to up their game else the middle eastern giants are going to scoop up your market as they offer a far easier product. We book business not only for comfort, but also ease to make changes, as many business people need to do. SIA make it so difficult. Coupled with the fact the middle eastern carriers offer limo transfers both ends as part of the ticket too.
The staff on board are still amazing ,and flight is pretty good, but the whole operation is being let down by the administration side which spoils the overall experience.",neutral
3255,"Singapore sets the standard There is a reason Singapore Air is rated year after year one of the top international carriers. 

I’ve been flying Singapore for decades and have always been impressed with the level of service.  I no longer fly enough to secure business class so this time I elected to travel Premium Economy. I would say that Singapore’s economy is better than any US carrier flying to Asia but due to the length of the flight decided to go Premium Economy. 

The Premium Economy is not business class but is sufficiently better than economy that if you can get a reasonable price for the seat, it is worth the upgrade. You receive some of the same amenities as business class-convenience package, up graded entertainment center including full head phones and the ability to select your meals in advance. The big difference is the seat. The seat is reclinable and there is a leg support and a foot rest. The seat is also wider. I was able to get a reasonably comfortable sleep in the flight. 

What sets this airline apart is that the planes and cabins are immaculate and the cabin crew are extremely pleasant and attentive to any needs you may have. 

I’ve flown on three classes of service on Singapore and they have never disappointed.",positive
1143,"Worst Customer Service We booked flights to Thailand for 4th February 2022 for our 5th Year wedding anniversary. We checked all the Covid and travel requirements 

Turned up to Heathrow Airport 3hours before departure time with all the required documents - only to find out on the 1st of February the Thailand Government reintroduced their Thai Pass scheme (which was previously suspended) the Thai pass needs at least 5 days to process and they advise 7 days before you can follow it up. Therefore if we applied for the Thai pass we would not have it in time. 

We explained our situation at the check in desk and even showed our attendant the UK government website which states the Thai pass is not required. Our Singapore check in attendant went and showed his manager. I also explained to the manager that we have all the required documents other than the Thai pass as it was impossible to attain the Thai pass in the timeframe we had. 

The manager then just shrugged his shoulder and said tough luck I’m not going to let you board the flight without it. At which point I said “I understand and I really need a help to find a solution because I’m not sure what I can do.” He replied to me saying “it’s not my problem - you have to leave”. 

The manager was completely rude and showed no empathy towards our situation. We pleaded at the ticket desk for some help but none was available. The staff at Thai Airways showed more empathy and care to answer our questions and explain the process. We literally had to turn back with all of our baggage and get a cab home. 

I will never book another flight with Singapore Airlines again and will definitely be sharing more segments of my ordeal online. 

They clearly do not care about their customers and have horrible Customer service",negative

The dinner and breakfast we were served were outstanding. Even my wife, who is very picky about food, raved about how good the meals were. The choice of beverages (especially the wines) were excellent and we felt like we were in a high class restaurant. (again, we were in the lowest class section).

477,"Booking nightmare I had an extremely disappointing experience with Singapore Airlines.
My holiday plans changed and i needed to make some changes to the dates and times of the flights, but this appeared to be impossible to complete.
On 2 or 3 separate occasions i called the Singapore Airlines telephone helpline and talked to operators in the Philippines. On each of these occasions i spent 2 to 3 hours trying to undertake and confirm some simple changes to my flights. On each occasion the operators were not able to process and confirm the requested changes.

I also (on numerous occasions) emailed Singapore Airlines with the details of the required changes and the details of the telephones conversations.

From all of my attempts to communicate with Singapore Airlines i did not receive a single communication or confirmation in response. Incredibly there was no audit trail or evidence of any of my conversations with them.

I checked my itinerary through the Singapore Airlines website about 3 weeks before i was due to leave to find that my return flight to NZ had been completely cancelled. I then decided to cancel the flights, but was incredulous when i found that i would have to pay the flight cancellation fee - this despite the debacle that had occurred up to this point. 

In the end i had to purchase a last minute, expensive flight with an alternative airline - which was a very simple and straightforward process.

In summary, i spent and wasted significant amounts of time dealing with Singapore Airlines, had to pay a cancellation fee and incurred significant additional cost as a result of Singapore Airlines ineptitude. I have flown with Singapore Airlines previously and have found their aircraft and services to be good, but i am disgusted with how i have been treated on this occasion. On this basis i would recommend other airlines (such as Emirates) in preference to Singapore Airlines.",negative

1168,"non-existent customer service We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not China Air cramped, but certainly not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. Their customer service was non-existent. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agent's line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days! We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed, seemingly permanently. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones.

8725,"Average, with seat problems and mediocre meals Took 4 regional flights - 3 on A330 and 1 on B787. What was common in all four was poor meals. They were quite substantial, but of low quality. What was said to be ""beef"" was beef burger patty. Staff were on the whole good and efficient, though there were a variety of attitudes. None were bad, though; just that some were tired while others were friendly and enthusiastic. Entertainment was extensive, though on the A330s it was still old-style and not on-demand. On the B787, the entertainment system was completely out of order. The seating is the thing that causes the most pain. The A330s were old and tired, and legroom was very tight. The seat was too upright and was very painful to be in. As for the B787, it had the correct angle of recline, making it very comfortable to sit in. This has been commented on by many travelers. However, with 9-abreast, the seat is extremely narrow. With this 9-abreast for B787 and 10-abreast for updated versions of B777, Singapore Airlines joins the rest of the world in the competition to squeeze and squash, and inflict torture on passengers. No longer a premium airline, I'm afraid, at least for regional flights. I had intercontinental flights on Singapore Airlines years ago, and they were superb. But those were on the 9-abreast B777, whose days are numbered now, sadly.",neutral

292,"Why can't Singapore Airlines act in good faith when altering bookings. ""Complimentary / No penalty"" should mean that. We booked return business class flights to Europe on flexible tickets.

It was then necessary for us to change the Sydney Paris leg to Sydney Istanbul on a later date.
The ticket conditions stated ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" . We expected this fare difference condition to be applied in good faith.

Singapore Airlines imposed a 30% penalty for this change.

I questioned the Singapore Airlines staff on this 30% penalty in two regards

Firstly, we were changing to a shorter, cheaper flight, why was the cost increasing?
* Flight Time for Singapore Paris is 13h 35m.
Flight Time for Singapore Istanbul is 11h 0m
* The fare for Sydney Paris is AUD7792.39-8217.25
The fare for Sydney Istanbul is AUD 6342.59 at the time we proposed the change to the booking.

Secondly, part of this change is that an airfare Singapore Paris on 26 Aug is now made available for sale by Singapore. The price of this fare is higher than the Istanbul fare which would be taken off the market by our change. So as well as charging an extra 30% for the outward bound leg of our journey, Singapore profit further by the higher sale price of that Paris fare. Singapore may well say that they might not sell this fare. Perhaps, but they also may not sell the Istanbul fare.

Despite interactions with many many Singapore Airlines staff, not one person ever answered the issues raised, or in any way ""owned the problem""

To make matters worse the Singapore Airlines representative proudly told me there was ""no penalty"" for the change in booking. In such case why the 30% charge for changing to a cheaper flight ?

So while I understand “revenue maximisation models” I also understand concepts of acting in good faith with customers. How does this latter concept factor in their penalty ? Singapore Airlines talks with pride about the experience it provides to people who fly with them. The process we are going through now is part of that experience. All we were looking for is that people act in good faith and with fairness.

These practices should really be reviewed by Australia's consumer protection authorities. The statement ""Booking change fee Complimentary (a fare difference may apply)"" is clearly grossly misleading. That should be our next step.",negative

Economy seat was uncomfortable at A350-800 for 13-14 hours. Painful ride with the uncomfortable hard seat. My legs had spasms and my back was sore and stiff after the poor seat cushion on SQ flight A-350-800 Singapore Airlines to New York City.
Koreain Air, LH, and EK would treat you better with seat options that it depends on cost of the ticket and class you paid for. I paid $880 for one way - a long international flight with SQ.
Meal Issue: Koreain Air, LH, and EK meals in economy cabin are superior and best quality than Singapore Airlines poor quality meal. I was shocked that SQ provided me a dinner meal: potato with previously frost green beans without a dessert. No fruits and no desserts at all on 13-14 hours international long haul flight.
I miss Korean Air, LH, and EK economy class and liked their meals so much delicious not SQ.

I asked Singapore Airlines crew members of the flight from SIN to FRA. They said that they do not have any dessert and no fruits.

During snack break and down service - there was available only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. 

Service Quality Issue: Singapore Airlines crew often missed or skipped my requests for 4th time during flights BKK-SIN and SIN-DUS. I noticed SQ lacked punctuality and SQ has flaws with sloppy service that I noticed and observed. I requested for water, snack, and coke. They ignored my requests and continued to smile politely. My fellow passengers were puzzled and they witnessed. LH, Korean Air, and EK crew members are very punctual and attentive with each passenger's request. 

Economy class overall experience is impressive and wow factors are offered only with international flights on Korean Air, Emirates, and Lufthansa. 

Do not waste your money for SQ Economy Class trip! There you would not get any better treatment or best experience. Singapore Airlines earned an award only for a business class product and business class service thats all. It is just speculative hype by SQ based on my past experience in economy class. Nothing impressive with SQ Economy class and its service. Fly with Korean Air, Lufthansa, and Emirates instead of Singapore Airlines.",neutral
5563,"17 1/2 hour flight I had wanted to fly the Airbus A350-9000 aircraft since I became aware of it.  There are two classes.  Business Class and Premium Economy.  I got a good airfare where it was BC going out and Premium Economy for the return.

This review is the outbound in business class.
The inbound is a few weeks away.

The good:
Boarding.
Cabin Service.
Food (great). I used the Book the Cook service prior to the flight
Large Entertainment screen

The NOT SO Good:
The seat.  Yes the seat.  It was a lie flat seat but one had to angle one's legs into the left corner instead of straight on.
To get into the lie flat position one had to get up and pull the seat back down. Make up the seat, etc.  The reverse when going back to a sitting position.
The entertainment selection was not by using a touch active screen but a overly sensitive controller.

Would I fly it again? Doubtful.",neutral
31,"Best business class seat I have flown many business class flights on 5-star airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways, and Korean Air. However, on long-haul flights, Singapore Airlines' business class B777-300ER has great service, seats, and food onboard. The flight crew is very friendly. They care about me and respond quickly if I request something. The food is really tasty, especially the Western style. I ate lobster thermidor, and it is one of the best foods I have ever eaten on an aeroplane. Besides that, their hard product is the top reason why I chose Singapore Airlines. I chose 11K for my seat on this flight. The bulkhead seat provides a spacious bed, and it is wide enough that my companion and I can sit together.",positive
1686,"Great Product and excellent service despite full flight Singapore Airlines operates several aircraft types between Singapore and Bangkok. For this flight, we flew with Singapore Airlines B787-10 which is one of the newest aircraft in the Singapore Airlines fleet.

Singapore Airlines B787-10 has a two-class configuration, capable of carrying up to 337 passengers with 36 Business Class seats and 301 Economy Class seats. Economy Class is split into two sections. All seats in Economy Class are arranged in the 3-3-3 configuration. The seats in the Economy Class cabin are generally decked in light grey fabric with some seats in light blue. The use of purple and orange mood lighting used during boarding makes the cabin looks bright and refreshing.

The lavatories in the Economy Class cabin are located in the mid and the aft part of the aircraft. The lavatories are no bigger than those found onboard other Singapore Airlines aircraft. The use of mirrors in the lavatory makes the lavatory looks larger than it actually is. Singapore Airlines is perhaps one of the few airlines that stocked their Economy Class cabin lavatories with amenities such as toothbrush, combs and razors on top of the handsoap. Passengers can also find hand lotion and Eau de toilette in the lavatory. Singapore Airlines installs sensor-activated tap and toilet flush making the use of the lavatory more hygienic.

The seats onboard Singapore Airlines B787-10 features their new Economy Class seats. The seats in Economy Class cabins are very comfortable with a pitch of 32"" and width of 17.5"". The legroom in the seats is very good, adding more comfort for the 2-hour flight time to Bangkok. Seat recline button is found on the armrest.

Most of the seat features in the Economy Class seats can be found on the panel in front of each seat, making it look very clean and well designed. It has everything that a passenger needs for their flight. There is a small compartment below the TV screen that allows passengers to stow small items such as mobile phones or the earphones that the airlines provide for the In-Flight Entertainment System. Tray tables can be folded into half and are large for Economy Class standards, capable of allowing passengers to do some work on their laptops. The seat reading light is situated on the ceiling above the seat.

There is a cup holder in every Singapore Airlines Economy Class seats making it convenient for passengers to place their cups into while not deploying the tray table. Flight attendant call buttons and switches for the reading light can be found on a small panel on the bottom left of the TV screen. The USB charging port and headphone jacks are located next to the call buttons. There is a small coat hook in each Economy Class seat. On top of the USB charging port, Singapore Airlines is thoughtful enough to install a universal power plug for every two seats for passengers to charge their lifestyle devices, conveniently located under the armrest in front of the passengers.

The seat pocket is large enough for passengers to store their iPads. There are two other smaller pockets in front of the main seat pocket, which I find useful to put small items like a passport. The main seat pocket contains the usual inflight magazines such as Singapore Airline's travel magazine - SilverKris, the in-flight entertainment catalogue - KrisWorld, and the in-flight duty-free catalogue - KrisShop.

Each Economy Class seat onboard Singapore Airlines B787-10 comes with an 11'1"" personal TV with touchscreen function. The touchscreen function is very responsible and is the only way passenger can control the In-Flight Entertainment system. There is no IFE controller found in the seat since IFE controls can be done on the TV. Singapore Airlines' KrisWorld has an extensive library of entertainment options, arranged in easy to navigate menus. KrisWorld has the latest blockbuster movies from Hollywood as well as regional movie titles. Scrolling through the KrisWorld is similar to how one would scroll through on their tablet, passengers can swipe left or right to get to the type of entertainment option they desire and click on the large icon to launch the movie or TV show they want to watch.

Meal service commenced about 30 mins into the flight. Flight attendants went around distributing dinner together with drinks. Passengers were given the option of Char Siew Rice of Green Curry Chicken with fried rice. The Char Siew Rice I opted was very tasty and the pork meat was very tender and well marinated. The rice is a tad hard. I did not like the Quinoa and Vegetable that was served as an appetiser was less to be desired. The Mango pudding dessert is good though.

Service onboard this Singapore to Bangkok flight onboard Singapore Airlines in Economy class was good. Despite being a busy full flight, service onboard Singapore Airlines Economy Class was not compromised. Flight attendants are seen offering help to passengers with their carry-on luggage during boarding. Meal service was done with a smile. As soon as the seat belt sign was turned off, one of the flight attendants approached my friend and me to inform us that they have taken note of our food allergies and told us the options for dinner prior to the meal service run. After taking our preference, the flight attendant emerged from the galley with our food ahead of the rest of the passengers. When requested for a can of coke to share with my friend and the flight attendant happily hand us the coke and even asked if it is sufficient for the two of us.

Singapore Airlines new Economy Class product on the B787-10 is very good. The seats are very comfortable and the legroom is generous for Economy Class. The IFE menu is very easy to navigate via the touchscreen function on the TV and the touchscreen is very responsive. There are loads of entertainment option on KrisWorld that kept me entertained throughout the 2-hour flight to Bangkok. Interactions with the flight attendants were rather minimal as this is a full flight. Despite that, service is always done with a smile. This short flight with Singapore Airlines is quite enjoyable.",positive
9402,"Excellent long flight Good legroom and very comfortable seat.  Service and food was excellent.

Singapore to New Delhi - A380, great seats, fantastic staff and great food.

409,"Rudest Customer Service I have ever experienced They changed my flight without proper notification. And then when I asked them for any possible solutions they were extremely rude. They refused to take any responsibility and were just horrible to deal with. I even asked to speak to a supervisor and the guy simply said there is no one else to talk to. They will send an email to your spam folder, tell you that you didn't see it and it isn't their problem. Horrible company will never deal with them again.",negative
9633,"Always nice but sometimes they just don't I travelled a lot with Singapore Airlines throughout my life probably my second most after Garuda Indonesia. I went to Tokyo (via Narita) with Singapore Airlines in Business Class twice this year and I only got a problem when I was in my flight back from Narita to Jakarta via Singapore where the flight attendant shoo me away while I was in line waiting for lavatory (it was the new dreamliner and pretty small). I was with other passenger who was also confuse being told to get back into our seats. It wasn't a very pleasent experience since they only have two lavatories available in Business Class.

The Aircraft - My first flight from CGK to NRT was in January where they still use the old 777-300/800ER (the specified brown one) and it was very very nice since you got a very wide and comfy Business Class, but my latest flight was using the Dreamliner which was has a very small seat compare to the previous one. I hope SQ can fix this.

Food - Everything was nice since they were serving international choice and Japanese choice both are fine.",positive

7090,"Singapoer Airlines do not live up to its reputation - never again We left Auckland on 22 December and returned 19 January (total of 4 flights) and was booked in premium economy.  I had a expectation of what the service would be like having flown the same class on other airlines.  
BUT :  The service was poor, the one hostess in our section serving on the right hand side was very abrupt on the Auckland to Singapore leg, the food very disappointing, and the toilets were never cleaned during the flights, causing the paper disposals to overflow and making using the bathrooms unpleasant.  The only leg of our journey that was an exception was the flight from Johannesburg to Singapore.  We also were not seated together on 2 legs of our journey and the check in staff were unapologetic and unhelpful.  10.5 hours is a long time to sit with strangers if your family is sitting somewhere else.
I have seen Singapore airline's advertising and was looking forward to the flights (even if the trip was 25 Hours) but the reality was shockingly different. I will never fly them again and would actively advise others not to.",neutral
9305,"Good Airline But too Long We are over 80 & chose to fly with Singapore Airlines as they offered most direct flight to Shanghai where we joined a cruise ship. As we have some mobility limitations, the airline provided us with wheelchair transport between check-in, gate lounges & exit.
The service on board was good, catering was good & seating relatively comfortable, with a good selection of movies.
In retrospect for us, the 9 hours to Singapore, 3 hour stop over & 5 hour flight to Shanghai was too long & we would have been better off to  do the flight in 2 separate stages.",positive
1990,"Two trouble free flights to Auckland We were off to visit our son and grandson in New Zealand and chose to go via Singapore stopping for a couple of nights before flying on to Auckland.
The booking in and luggage drop at Heathrow was quick and simple with no queues to speak of, also boarding was organised and easy.
The crew on the plane were as friendly and helpful as normal and the food was better then expected for economy class. The A380 seemed to be new and comfortable.
Our short stay in Singapore was very good but when i went to book in for the flight to Auckland I hit a problem in that NZ immagration said my visa was not valid and so I went to the Singapore Airline and a young lady there got it sorted speaking to NZ immagration to find the problem then got it sorted so I could fly and I can't speak to highly of the service she gave us. 
Our 2nd flight from Singapore to Auckland was not so good with a much older A380 plane and the food not to our tastes but the service was as good as ever.",positive
8053,"You get what you pay for Flight was ok - slept mostly.  Stewardess and steward were rather efficient going about their tasks.

8055,Poor seat assignment and Service Upon check in receptionist didn't bother to establish eye contact. Me and my hubby were sandwiched in between 2 couples who obviously only wanted to seat in ailes and we're probably gold members as they were served food an hour ahead of us. Finally we were given a choice of food but after 10 minutes attendant came back that there is only fish left. What's the point in giving choices when there's none. So ended up disappointed and hungrier. I think it's only good to travel business in this airline as tried it the first time we flew with them. Seats though in premium economy are not bad if they could have managed the seating assignment better. Was surprised how unthoughtful service was as heard only good stuff about Singapore Airlines.,negative
1688,"Excellent Flight I've always been very proud of Singapore Airlines being Singapore's own International Airline.  I would like to commend on a senior crew which for the 1st time I have very good impression of how this senior steward tried to make contact and he was very friendly and made passengers who walked past him felt so comfortable and at ease.  He will cracked some jokes and this definitely helps those who have flight phobia to felt at ease.  He was also very helpful and offered passengers who needed help willingly. Though my flight was just a short flight of about 2 hours, I would say, this is 1 of the BEST experience I had with Singapore Airlines. Thank you for that friendly gestures and your kind & helpful attitude in serving.",positive

The plane was old, the seat back touch screens were in need if maintenance and repair, I like to play the games but you couldn’t.  The food was only just warm (health risk?) and the staff were not very visible, they seemed really keen for everyone to sleep, although it was a morning flight.  There was a distinct lack of drinks and no alcoholic drinks were offered at all.

3469,"Still the best Airline. But on this sector, the special meal was an unusual disappointment. When it comes to choosing an airline for our travel abroad, my first choice has always been Singapore Airlines. Yes, indeed the cost for flying this premium airline is often higher than others but what price would one pay for safety, punctuality and good meals and excellent service. 
However, our recent return flight from Colombo to Singapore was surprisingly a big disappointment in that our special meal was far below par. Both my wife and I just could not eat what was suppose to be our “sea-food” meal. So too was the plain shrimp salad and obviously stale bun! We just left them uneaten.
I only hope that competitive pricing in airline flights won’t make this worse.

Neither my Husband or I regretted making that Bid because we were allocated two very comfortable seats with plenty of leg room at a bulkhead up the front of the Economy Section.

The seats were a tad larger than the Economy Class Seats so they were a lot more comfortable and made our eight hour flight much better and so much more pleasant!!!

Once in 2017 over 5 hours in Singapore Airport missing connections and resulting in another 3 hours waiting for new connections and they gave us a multi plug for power points in different countries only to have it break first time.  Last Friday their flight was late leaving Bangkok creating another 5 hour delay in Melbourne only to be given a $15 voucher each to use in Singapore airport for something to eat. We bought 2 drinks and it still cost us an extra $10. Maybe just bad luck but really we have flown with other airlines without any delays. What an exhausting trip home both times.

The terminals are very nicely designed and off a relaxing environment. 

I have flown many times from Zurich to Singapore using Singapore airlines, and then further to places in Australia and South East Asia.

I was seated behind a rather huge gentleman.
The seat he was in was faulty, meaning, when he put his seat back, every time he moves, the seat moves.
It also meant I was unable to use the screen. He moved a lot. Not able to watch anything for entire flight.

Babies were crying the entire flight, I could hear them through my noise cancelling headphones. I know you cannot stop a baby from crying but would it not be lovely if airlines can make a soundproof compartment and put family with babies in there.

I complained about the seat to a crew, they managed to find me a seat but it was a between 2 persons compared to my aisle. I did not accept the change. It would be changing a problem to another problem.

Food was good, snacks were available. They have taken away the amenities pack unless you ask for it.

Toilets were quite clean, but, there was a stench of urine even though the floor was dry.
I believe it’s from nooks and cranny not throughly cleaned.
That really could be improved.
The toilet door will not shut properly, meaning after a person has left the toilet, unless you physically close it, the toilet door always remain ajar.
I was seated very near the toilet, the light and smells were not good news.

The food is very good but one can tell that Singapore airline is cutting cost. Less flight attendants on flights, water ? well this is the first airline I see that does not have bottled water but serves you water out of the water tank on the plane. The quality of the water or at least the taste of it is not very good.

6223,"Great Consistent Airline Over the years we've used several airlines to make our regular annual visits to Western Australia but Singapore Airlines, in our view, are head and shoulders above other airlines which we have used. Singapore Airlines have the added bonus of flying out of Manchester, which means we can avoid the hassle of Heathrow.
The staff are welcoming and friendly and the in-flight service is second to none. Just one small negative is the quality and lack of variety of the food, particularly the vegetarian options. That said, we don't expect 'haute cuisine' but SA, as with other airlines, could step up their food quality/variations.

Very difficult to get answers from Singapore Airlines and still waiting for $150 vouchers for 2 people which were offered over 7 months ago 
It is the ground crew that are outsourced for check in that are the problem no matter how nice you are to them

5422,Best Airline by far Flight from Brisbane to Singapore was great with excellent service from all staff (far exceeds Emirates who we flew with last year). Our flight from Singapore to Bangkok had a hiccup when the aircraft had to be replaced. We were fully informed by staff and each were given a snack pack whilst we waited for the new aircraft. The thing is they were honest and kept us up to date frequently. Well done Singapore Air.,positive
1015,"5 star service, 5 star Airline. simply excellent. Airbus A380 LHR-SIN was great, very clean, spacious seats in econ and the CC were excellent. Food is a choice of Chicken or Noodles with fish, both were very good, plenty of drinks on offer and a good standard of service. CC very professional. Toothbrushes available in the toilets and earplugs / eyeshades available from CC if you ask.
IFE is brilliant, headphones and cleaning kit given out prior to boarding.

Flight departed on time, landed early. Singapore airport is awesome.

Airbus A350 SIN-MNL again, a new aircraft, very clean and every bit as good as the previous leg. Boarding is ordered, well organised and slick.

Airbus A350 MNL-SIN - As above.

Boeing 777-300  SIN-LHR Very old and sadly tired out 777 on the night flight ex SIN to LHR. Seats were hard and worn, headrest was stiff and uncomfortable and overall it was a very tired plane. IFE was still very good however.
Food was still very good, CC excellent and of a very high standard.",positive

finally 6 months later- after over 30 hours on hold received a whopping $352 credit-  

This review is based on their lack of response and basically stating at the gate I was lucky to be going to the maldives at all.  Our friend who we booked with had to fly in a day early after being dropped by airline completely....so maybe we were lucky.",negative

The flight to & from Singapore to Heath Row was a little better. The food was very poor quality. We will never fly Singapore Airlines again, & wouldn't recommend anyone else to do so. There appears to be to many seat's crammed into the economy class compartments.

4184,"Best in its class If you think of premium class airline, Singapore Airlines is probably the best for your destination. Here some pros & cons of it:

Pros:
Ground: You may expect very good cooperation from ground staffs. I sincerely regret to disclose this but I really thank to ground staff to allow my excess weight with smile.

On board: You will start with smile and right after sitting a hot towel to refresh yourself. Food are delicious. Good number of movies, serials, documentaries, games and so on. Shaving kit, comb, sanitary napkin and other necessary items available at lavatory. You may get them if you need. Overall, you won't get boar so far.

For kid: If you have a little angel with you, it means you are in first row. They welcome the angel with gift box, special meal (if takes weaning food) and a bassinet for baby's comfort. 

Cons: Nothing remarkable. But it is expensive. Although service worth it, yet expect Singapore Airlines authority will consider this.

My experience: It was our honeymoon trip so far. They somehow noticed and surprised us with gift, drinks and food!!! However, it is highly recommended.",positive
8145,"Classy Airline Booked a trip to Australia via an online travel agent and was pleased to find that the airline was Singapore after reading reviews and we werent disappointed. There were 4 of us travelling and I had booked extra legroom seats for 2 of our party as the were 6ft and 6ft 4. We are also tall but were quite comfortable in our regular seats. From the moments we got on board the lovely hostesses in their beautiful ""uniforms"" made us feel welcome.

8956,"Safety issues on SIA flight from Shanghai to Spore-01Sept 2018 On 01 Sept 2018 boarded SQ Flt from Pudong, Shanghai to Spore. Flight was almost full of passengers including from South Asia and many from China.
The south Asian couple with baby opened overhead compartment to retrieve their item during flight and didn’t bother to close it. Other passenger have to do it as flight steward was not observant.
During landing a PRC passenger stood up to peek at granddaughter seated forward at next row. Steward seated 2 rows in front signaled him to sit, which he did but didn’t bother to wear safety belt!! The Steward presumably from PRC appears tired and couldn’t care less.
Shocking that safety standard in SQ planes had dropped and worsened by PRC and South Indian passengers, who blatantly switched on HP when plane was descending.. why can’t SQ install HP jamming if this was considered a serious safety issue. SQ cabin staff standard dropped and coupled with reckless unsafe passengers, makes flying unsafe.",negative

How can I agree to pay 20k for tickets online priced at 2500 that's makes no sense at all. Then they tell me they have to investigate, log online and type in my itinerary and you'll see the price is not 20k, what's to investigate???

3442,"Superb flight Was booked on the Boeing 777-300ER for my biz trip to Canberra and I have to say the flight to and back was more exciting than the destination itself. The service was good and was quickly served a welcome drink and some warm nuts. As I was on a day flight I was constantly stuffed with food (in a good way). The Book a cook service is a must if you are travelling on SQ biz class and I ordered the Chirashi Don and the barramundi on the way back. Was a little disappointed that the raw fish on it wasn’t exactly raw but slightly cooked probably due to freshness issue. The appetiser was pretty good and you get to choose your type of bread and cheese to go with. The wine collections as well as the coffee and tea selections were pretty good as well. The tv screen spans across the back of the seat in front of me and it’s def a very comfortable ride. After 4 hours of non stop eating and movies, I flatten the bed to catch a quick nap. Was def easy to set the bed and it comes with a plush pillow and comforter.

These legs of our journey were very good and we couldn’t fault them. The service coming back to Singapore from Male was good even though we were experiencing turbulence, the flight attendants were still able to give us a meal and plenty of drinks. It all unraveled once we boarded in Singapore to come back to Sydney. Our seats were fine it was just the service. We declined the meal and I wasn’t even offered a drink, ever again. When we woke for breakfast by the time they got to us there wasn’t anything eatable left. The people beside us couldn’t even eat theirs. This is so unlike the airline we have flown with before.

Singapore Airlines wasn't particularly empathetic to the situation and offered to ask if one passenger could swap their seat so we could sit together.  They weren't willing to ask others (or demand). Thankfully the person said yes. The plane was older than expected.  Service on the plane and the food were rather average.",neutral

I asked for a glass of water but never received it, and my plate was not cleared away after my meal.
I thought it might just be the crew on one flight but they were the same on all four flights. The last leg of my journey I sat with two other white women and we were treated appallingly.  In the end we could just look at each other and shrug our shoulders.

He let us know our bags would not not make the flight but there would be someone in Male who would coordinate their delivery to us the next day...all true.

Very attentive staff who greet you by name, great food and drink options, and nothing is too much trouble.  My wife's seat table developed a fault (after the meal service) and could not be stowed.  Four staff were involved in getting it fixed over a period of maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Later in flight there was an invitation to spend some money from the in-flight shopping, to make up for the inconvenience.  This was above and beyond, and was not asked for or expected.

We flew on a Boeing 777-200 for the first flight and an Airbus 330 for the second. If you compare the seat map of Singapore's aircraft to something like Air Canada or Air France, there is one seat less in each row making individual seats roomier than on the same class of aircraft.

4869,"Singapore no more I have just returned to Adelaide with my elderly mother from Singapore on flight SQ279. It was by far the worst flight I can ever remember. I’ve been regular on this service, for over 30 years and also have travelled around the world, using nearly every airline there is. The food and drink service on this flight was appalling. Every time I had used this service, we were all served dinner shortly after departure so we didn’t have a dinner in Singapore. There was nothing to eat at all for around 4 hours when we were served breakfast, which was totally inedible. I tried both options and the standard was totally appalling. We were not offered any drink receiving only one or two small glasses of water. People on the plane all complained. I personally spoke to the supervisor and he offered me apology and sandwich which consisted of a stale roll with some sort of spread. It was also inedible and not of Singapore Airlines standard. You must offer water to your travellers as we get it taken away from us when we go through customs etc. There’s a real problem within Singapore Airlines on this service which I will never use again. The supervisor was embarrassed and he offered his apology and agreed with my complaint. I asked for a customer feedback form of which I never received. I tried to do feedback on the screen, but because I’m not a member my feedback was invalid. I’m never flying Singapore Airlines and everyone in Adelaide needs to know all about this. They all need to be warned and advised to take their own food and drinking water on this Singapore to Adelaide flight. I’ve now tried to contact Singapore Airlines via numerous means, but they appear to be hiding and not willing to engage with me. Very sad.",negative

Due to empty seat in middle rows we were able to stretch out a little more both ways, even though their seats are comfortable and seem to have an extra inch for long legs if needed.

Received text message from SQ on Oct 9 advising us that our flight will depart st 7.20 am and will arrive in Singapore at 11 am, we’re all checked in and ready to board at 6 am in Gate 113 at NAIA Tetminal 3, at 8 am we’re advised that our flight will be delayed for 30 minutes. Around 9 am we’re told that the plane has technical problems and will leave at 2 pm instead then the flight attendants were serving our breakfast meal at the same airport gate. There was never any mention or options for us to change our flight to the next one when I asked the ground staff so we’re all waiting. Then lunch was served (picture attached)  and our flight was finally scheduled to leave Manila at 3.05 pm in the meantime at gate 114 the passengers of SQ917 were boarding their plane at 1.50pm and that flight leave on schedule (2.15pm).

At that point no further explanation given from the ground staffs, I received generic email and text message from SQ regarding the flight delay and that they’re sorry for any inconvenience caused. 

We boarded the plane at 3.05pm, got another half an hour delay in the runway until it finally take off, we landed in Singapore at 8pm!

285,"Singapore airlines, Worst airline ever Had the most horrific dealings with Singapore airlines check in manager at Changi airport, firstly my wife is registered as disabled and my wife and i are both in our 60's.
We booked extra legroom seats because of my wife's disability and returned from Singapore to London Heathrow on flight SQ306 on Monday 29th May 2023, we had a really upsetting and stressful experience after we boarded the flight, this was also witnessed by the cabin crew who have submitted a separate report by leading steward Benjamin Khoo.
The problem was caused by the boarding gate manager in Singapore, we boarded at gate 9.
The first issue was that the seats we had booked were 31A and 31C in premium economy were emergency exit seats and we were told that we would have to be moved because of my wife's mobility issues, this was fine and we were allocated seats 32H and 32K, we were taken to the gate (my wife in a wheelchair) and boarded with no issues and got settled into our seats for the long 13 hour flight home.
Obviously the people who were originally in the seats that we moved to were offered the free upgrade for the extra legroom seats we had originally booked, this is where the problems started.
One of the passengers ( a male in his late 20's early 30's  )who was moved was not happy with the free upgrade and there was obviously a lot of discussions taking place which we could witness from where we were seated but did not know the content of, eventually the check in manager entered the plane ( the same man who gave us our new seats ) and after a few minutes of talking to the man in his 20's / 30's came over to where we were now settled and said that the man was not happy with his new upgraded seat and wanted his original seat back, he ordered us to move to seats 33F and 33G which were middle aisle seats, i told the manager that my wife needed to get up and move around to stop her seizing up, but he was not interested and said move or he would have us escorted from the plane, he was extremely rude and arrogant and was not interested in my wife's disability and the pain it then caused her to move again, he was more interested in letting a fit and able young man have his original seat back. this exchange was witnessed by multiple passengers and crew, the lady who was moved with this young man was not happy either and would have been happy to stay in her upgraded extra legroom seat, if this is the quality of management that Singapore airlines wish to employ we will never travel with Singapore airlines  again, this man has single handily destroyed my faith in Singapore airlines.
The stewards on the plane were very sorry for what they had witnessed and truly did all they could to try to make up for what had happened but ultimately this check in manager represents the whole of Singapore airlines and this individual had no concern or care for my wife's disability, my wife was extremely upset and we both felt stressed and anxious by this extremely unpleasant experience and would like to think that some form of action be taken against the manager that caused this issue. 
I emailed Singapore airlines on our return and received a reply which blamed the crew on the plane, i replied telling them the facts again but received no reply, i have tried contacting Singapore airlines a few times and have given them plenty of time to reply but now is the time to tell the world just how Singapore airlines deal with disabled passengers.
Finally, i was promised a refund for the upgraded seats we had paid for but have still not received anything, my next email will be to the AviationADR as Singapore airlines clearly do not care about disabled passengers",negative
3612,"Flight Confirmation Error I booked a flight from Hong Kong bound to Singapore, 3 weeks before the flight date. September 6, 2019 I was at Hong Kong International Airport and as I went to the check in counter of Singapore Airlines, they told me that it was cancelled. It’s quiet bizarre, since 2 days before the flight they sent me an online check in noticed. Their reason was the bank did not authorized the charge, however it is in contrast to what the bank is saying the moment I called them on the date I am at the airport. I checked the booking confirmation on their website again, the status of the flight is still confirmed and the crew wants me to pay it AGAIN. What a horrible experience. pfft!",negative

Even on flights with business half empty - never happens. You can't bid prior like other airlines, if it's disabled in manage booking you will only get deflected answers from kris flyer support team.

442,"Broken promises to their customers I was looking to earn 1,800 elite miles to qualify for Silver status (status doesn't mean that much to me, but it gets you further up the waitlist when redeeming miles for flights, which I do care about). I contacted their customer reps prior to booking on a partner flight since I don't live in Asia and was told I would earn elite miles on this partner airline. After I flew, I saw regular miles accrue, but nothing credited to my elite miles balance. I contacted their customer service, who told me they would fix this but it would take 2 weeks. I contacted them after those 2 weeks and was told they would address it, but they would need at least 4 weeks. It's been about a month so I followed up and am now being told I won't be able to get those miles credited. 

I'm so incredibly angry about the fact that I booked a flight to earn this nominal amount of miles--and had confirmed I'd earn elite miles with them--only to be told I was given misinformation by them THREE times--and that they won't resolve this for me. I've flown with them quite a lot this past year and have an insane amount of frequent flier miles with them and am shocked at how poorly they're handling this.",negative

The quality and service of food is much higher quality than North American airlines.  The TV screen definitely more high definition.

Unfortunately, the airline does charge you for seat selection.",positive
3296,"Excellent Airline, Great Cabin Crew I can understand why Singapore airlines is always ranked in top 10 airlines every year.
Food on the flight was good. 

Great selection of food in the lounge, particularly at Changi Airport.  Flight crew were professional and attentive.  I slept pretty much most of the flight from LHR > SIN, and enjoyed the flight from Singapore to Sydney.  Business class seats were roomy and comfortable.

Tip: If you’re considering premium economy, i would recommend just sticking to economy and selecting seats at the front with extra leg room.  I’ve done this in the past and it’s just as comfortable as flying PE.

We flew premium economy from SIN to Amsterdam, and we felt the price difference we paid was not worth it - You do get an upgrade on the food selection, plus a tiny bit of extra leg room but it’s not really that more comfortable as an economy seat. If you really wish to be comfortable then spend the money on Business Class seats so you can really sleep in comfort + lounge access + priority check in.",positive

Great flight. Great entertainment options. Professional, young, friendly attendants. Wish I'd found Singapore Air years ago. 
Flight attendants were constantly serving water and beverages, probably twice as many trips down the aisles as other airlines. Staff is well trained and take pride in their work. 
Nearly 18 hours in the air is a challenge for anyone, but the attendants seemed to take it in stride. 
I missed the last leg of my trip. My fault entirely: I misread the departure board. Sleep deprivation, and for me, Changa was an unfamiliar airport.  But the agent at the transfer station helped me out by giving me my options, and for an extra $100 changed my ticket to the same flight, next day. It was seamless. He arranged for my checked bags to be there on the carrousel at my destination on the next day's flight. Such a relief. 
A hint: For connecting flights at Changa, read the departure board carefully. The screen scrolls through fast. The flight I should have been on announced a change to a gate and then disappeared from the screen. The flight I inadvertently waited for was a different airline but just one digit off from the flight I should have been on. 
Singapore Airlines is definitely my new airline of choice.",positive
793,"The worst experience ever I am yet to fly with Singapore Airlines as my tickets are booked for October but I can honestly say this is the worst booking experience we have ever had. We booked through an authorised agent and the booking including an infant in seat. 

We checked all the requirements on Singapore Airlines website and purchased a car sear which fit all their criteria. This was particularly expensive  as the seat needed to be CAA certified. We were then notified by SA that we couldn't have the infant with seat even though we had paid for it and even though we had followed their own guidelines. They advised that the infant had to be over 6 months which it doesn't state on any of their literature. 

SA took weeks looking into this issue during which time my tickets were voided incorrectly causing issues with my credit card. I called 11 times to the helpline when managers promised to call back but failed to do so. 

The whole process has been a nightmare and other than offering hollow apologies Singapore Airlines have been incredibly unhelpful. I would never book with them again and would warn anyone else used to Emirates or Etihad to steer clear.",negative

I got an e-mail from them today stating that I was not entitled to any refund owing to a ""no show"", even though they acknowledged the cancellation and I verified it by going back to manage my booking on the airline's web site, where the hotel arrangement did not show any more.

We flew to Bangkok with Qantas and back via Singapore from Singapore. However in our economy flying  experience, Qantas wins hands down for food and service.  
The food was to put it mildly abysmal. Breakfast consisted of a small sweet muffin, a dry bun with a pat of butter and jam and a pot of yogurt - not a protein in sight. My lunch was tasteless fish with overcooked broccoli and peas if some sort of sauce.  We have had better food offered on an hours flight with Bangkok Air.
Unlike Qantas there was no offer of a pre-meal drink and nibble and in fact very little choice - red or white wine and no spirits. 
On the plus side, the entertainment was good and the steward were very polite and willing and the toilets kept clean  and regularly sanitised.",neutral
6211,"Disappointing  Looking out of the terminal at the aeroplane on the apron, the Airbus A350-900 looks pretty cool with the ends of its wings turned up.
Inside the plane was clean and new with a spacious feel to it.  3x3 seat configuration with ample overhead storage. 

The mid cabin toilets were large and un-cramped and the in-seat entertainment system has a large flat touch screen and mains power socket.

Everything looked good for an enjoyable flight ... then I sat down!

The legroom was ample for me as a short fella (5’7”) but the seat itself was less than comfortable.  The seat base was well padded, but the back and lumber support were such an odd shape/angle that sitting comfortably in any position other than laying the seat back fully was uncomfortable and verged on causing pain in very little time.

I spent the whole flight adjusting my position to try to ease my discomfort.  This experience was reminiscent of, but not quite as bad as the Cathay Pacific economy seat fiasco of circa 10 years ago.  Not Good at all and frankly disappointing.

816,"Downgrade service of the airline after Covid situation My route is flying back to the US using SQ from Bali, and transit in Frankfurt. Bali to Singapore operated with their low cost airline, scoot. Very basic service like the other low cost airline, so I cannot command much. Singapore to Frankfurt, 12 hours flight: terrible Meals, no snack in between this long hours flight, no in flight meal purchase option despite their terrible meal option. So basically you stuck with their horrible meal and other amenities. Cold bread, no salad or fruit, and very poor meal selection. No game in flight as you need your own device, poor selection of movie. The only thing they offer I observe during my total 20++ hours flight back to the states is WATER. Frankfurt to NY, 8 hours flight, another horrible experience. Same movie selections from the previous flight (Singapore to Frankfurt), the meals option is even worse as the flight attendants refer this as not a long flight despite it is 8 hours flight with no other option of their poor meals and limited entertainment. 1st meal is maincourse, second one is a very basic pork/vegetarian sandwich. The flight attendant mention ""we don't have in flight purchase meal or snack for passengers, whatever we have we will give it to you."" However, they do not have anything to offer to you. Comparing to my experience with SQ before the covid situation, flying with them in the same economy class, they used to give you warm towels after you boarding to the airplane, and before each meal, warm bread, fruit or salads in every meals, ice cream in between of the flight hours or different variety of snacks, eye masks, which I refer it as a great memorable experience with them. With my recent flight with them, I don't have any good thing to remember during my flight from Bali to NY beside a boring long hours flight. Based on my recent experience with SQ, I don't think this airline deserves a 5 star airline rating if I compare it with another 5 star airline like Emirates or Qatar, flying in the same economy class. For me SQ nowadays is like a budget low cost airline which claim to be a 5 star. For the price that slightly cheaper than Emirates, I don't think is worth it to fly with SQ and I will definitely not recommend this airline for a long hour flight to anyone.",negative

Why didn't they save us the time and call us on the tannoy??? Customer service person then told us the bags would be arriving that evening and would be couriered to us asap.

The airline is invariably good, with attentive flight attendants, edible food (even in economy) and sufficient inflight entertainment for long haul flights. This time, on the outward flight the cabin was very cold however.  I wanted to bring my return flight forward by 7 days and when I contacted Singapore Airlines about doing so I was advised that it would cost in excess of an additional £800 for the same flights at the same times of day but just one week earlier than those originally booked. The most that I was able to have this extortionate fee and fare difference reduced to was £475. As a result I elected not to bring my return flight forward and also as a result I will now be looking for an alternative airline for all of my future Australia to Europe flights.

Food wise..? average as expected on most airlines. The only comment is that SIA should serve coffee or tea at end of our meal, rather together, by then our coffee is cold.",positive
8024,Comfortable Seats Singapore Airline has always been my number 1 Choice. The reason is because the seats is comfortable and space is wide enough for big size and Long legs people. But I realise the food is not getting very good recently. They should improve on this. They have wide range of entertainment on the tv as well.,positive
9280,"Consistently great but... Singapore cabin staff are consistently awesome. Nothing is a problem, they are quietly attentive and the food is always excellent too. Loved the A380 flights and most of the 777 flights with the exception of the 'old nail' 777 they fly into Wellington via Melbourne. This thing is so old and tired even the staff are embarrassed. You can't even lie completely flat to sleep which is simply not competitive these days.The entertainment is archaic too. Limited choice and the optics are of poor quality. Not what you expect in Business Class today and the sooner Singapore Airlines upgrade their aircraft on this route the better.",positive

3602,A bit cramped The flight was relatively uneventful but my wife and I did notice that the legroom was much smaller than any other Singapore flight we've ever been on. It was perhaps an older aircraft they are yet to replace but still...not the most comfortable 7 hours.,positive

I can recommend Singapore to everyone!!",positive
2272,"Still one of the best I flew to Paris via Singapore in November 2019. For the past few years, I’ve done most of my travel with Emirates because they are (usually) significantly cheaper - but you get what you pay for! The staff on my flight were cheerful, helpful and efficient. The in-flight entertainment was good (though any flight that long will stretch even the most up-to-date movie catalogues) and the seat was comfortable. An added bonus is a stopover in Singapore. As far as airports go, Changi remains almost impossible to beat. I’ll definitely fly Singapore again!",positive
6105,Premium Economy A380 versus A350 While Premium Economy was great on both aircraft we felt that the A380's seating was a bit more roomier. Our only complaint was the food. Very ordinary!,positive

9029,"Premium Economy is worse than Economy Singapore Airlines are in a sad state - they have been dropping their service quality in front of our eyes over the last 3 years, ever since Lee Kwan Yew died. 
We started using Premium Economy (PE) as soon as they started this class of service between LHR and SIN, flying return three a times a year. We hoped that it would get better with time and mature into a comfortable option, but the reverse happened.
    We'd love to know, which designer is responsible for the distinctly uncomfortable seats: back decline angle, bad lighting, inconvenient foot support, lack of space for storage during the long flight (13-14 hours). On top of poor ergonomics, the whole seat doesn't function properly: opening and folding foot support often requires getting up to operate.
    Since the space is cramped, the super-sensitive control of the screen keeps kicking in against passenger's wish, preventing sleep - this problem does not occur in the Economy class!
   Toilet visit requires going all the way to the back of the economy section. 
   Good food is only served on the way from London to Singapore - the supply on the return is poor. Champagne does not save the day.
   The worst part of the story is that we have already tried twice to get through to SIA with our comments. The response that we received was formal and lacked any substance, and did not have any evidence of trying to understand and improve.
   In the end, we gave up on their PE, and decided that flying Economy was altogether less stressful.
  Basically, PE isn't worth the premium they want the passenger to pay! Too bad ....",negative
4031,"Still the best way to fly, but quality beverage offerings is slipping The inflight service is still something to cheer about. And so is the food - the local fare of bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) is most comforting. But the wine offering is getting more and more pedestrian. Also the removal of malt whiskey (used to be Highland Park) choice from the list of beverage offerings for Business Class in a premium airline such as Singapore Airlines is in word - unbecoming",positive
7684,"Start your holiday the moment you fly SQ It’s really worth spending the extra bucks flying SQ to Perth.

1) inflight entertainment is impeccable 
We are totally spoilt for choices. The system kept us entertained throughout the flight.
2) spacious cabin and comfortable legroom. 3) service oriented . Staff are friendly and patient. 
4) food and beverages: food wise , SQ used to serve warm buns, but they seemed to have remove this added touch. Perhaps deliberately done to keep pricing competitive. The alcohols are still complimentary, much appreciated.
5) smooth flight, steady take off and landing . 
The only thing that makes my trip less satisfying is the service on the ground.
We were very early at the airport during our return flight in Perth . Even though our flight was 6 hours later (sq 224 ,640am), the auto check in counter was able to check us in , and we printed bag tags and 3 of our boarding passes, except for my daughter. We approached the customer service counter for SQ, telling her we faced difficulty in checking in. Without even first hearing us out,  the staff directed us to the bag drop queue. Apparently the ground staff are handling an earlier flight sq216. We told the staff that we are not able to print our daughter’s boarding pass, But again the bag drop counter staff did not check with us. 
She went ahead to tag our luggage’s and sent 2 of our luggages to the plane through the conveyor belt. Upon tagging the 3rd luggage she finally realized we were supposed to be on the next plane. 
She apologized and told us to wait for the luggage team help us retrieve the luggages. The customer service staff also came to us to apologize.
I personally feel that there’s a lack of customer care. These 2 staff’ mechanical treatment of our situation shows that they are more concerned with getting things done quickly than serving the customers. Both staff failed to understand our situation 
The wrong tagging could easily been avoided had either of them bothered to hear our situation.
Whilst SQ excel in providing great service in the air, I think the service standard especially when it comes to customer care during check in plays a critical role in the overall customer satisfaction.
As a Singaporean, I am deeply concerned in this discrepancy in standards 
Hope there could be better training on this aspect 
 I think SQ is still the go to airline.",positive
6621,First Premium Economy flight. We fly to SE Asia twice a year with Singapore Airlines. This was our first Premium Economy flight and we loved it.

3188,"Great service Service and food were good. Staff frequently cleaned the laboratory which was great to see especially when you were a long haul flight. I was on the upper level of the aircraft, so the leg space was quite good.

3183,"Always good service, but be aware changing inflight menu This time we were flying on economic. Last time business. A world to difference.
But never mind the staff very helpful and smiling!!!
Before we travelled,  I had changed my inflight menu to menu without fish!
It was really a mistake! I was jaloux at my husband's food.
I got dinner as if I was a diabetic and also had allergies to gluten.
I have never eaten so much chips!
I think they have to listen more carefully about food,  if it's only fish you can't have.
So at once on our holiday I have changed to inflight menu. If I get fish, I will give it to my husband. 
This is our 46 travel with this company. And in April 2020 we do it again. 
Our best recommendations.",positive

Seats in Airbus 380 were very good and extremely wide. Food was excellent, the lounge in Frankfurt and Singapore (waiting for our connecting flight) as well and I could take a nice shower there.

915,"DEL to SIN on an A380 Check-In : At the dedicated Business Class check-in desk , which was very quick & smooth.

Immigration / Security : Dedicated counters / lanes for First / Business class passengers. Quick clearance as usual.

Lounge : Air India Lounge
Since SQ's own lounge at DEL has shut down , the airline diverts all its premium passengers here.
Very underwhelming. Portions of the lounge were dirty. Horrible F&B options. Expected much more considering the recent privatization of AI.

Boarding : Very streamlined. Dedicated queue / gate / aerobridge for Suites & Business Class passengers. Attentive ground staff & crew made it even better.

Seat / Layout : 
All the Business Class seats ( along with the 6 Suites ) were on the Upper Deck in this newer A380 variant , arranged in 1-2-1 pattern. Plush & comfortable , as long as you don't sleep. The moment you convert it into a lie-flat bed , you'll encounter the infamous angulated coffin-style hole for your legs / feet , which is uncomfortable for even someone as short as me.
The seat control panel on my particular seat was not smooth / a bit erratic . Even the FA Call Button did not work , thus had to rely on the remote control option. This wasn't the case for the other seats occupied by my family members , where things worked perfectly fine.

Service : Extremely professional & quick.

Food : Used 'Book The Cook' service. Herb Crusted Pork Chops were undercooked. The Chilli Basil Prawn was quite good though.",positive
7008,"Has the food quality dropped? I must say that we had always been happy customers of Singapore Airlines - although my last review was negative due to a very unpleasant check-in experience in Jan 2018. 

This time, it was mostly about the food. Normally, I can’t fault the professionalism of the flight attendants. However, something was awry on this flight. We took off at 8.40 pm Singapore time, but dinner wasn’t served until 11ish pm - that’s 3 hours later. After the meal and tray collection, we managed to have some sleep, only to be woken up at 2ish am as they were serving breakfast.  

The dinner was just ok, but the breakfast was the worst ever - a stale bread roll and a cold muffin. Seemed like a cost-cutting measure to me. Very disappointing in-flight experience.",negative

41,"Nothing premium about premium economy I booked premium economy as I wanted more leg room and a foot and calf rest. I have a disability and need to be comfortable. Staff were excellent on boarding and I was shown to my seat. Leg room was good and seat seemed comfortable. However there is nothing premium about premium economy. After takeoff we were given a snack, but nothing to drink. I asked if I could have a drink and was advised that drinks would be offered later. Why would I want to eat a snack with nothing to drink. I waited and waited. There was no bottle of water in the seating area which should have been there. After 1 hr and 20 mins finally it looked like drinks were being offered. Juice or water only. Me and my husband were missed out. We thought they would realise so waited patiently. Staff had got to economy when I got up and asked if I could have a drink as we had been missed. After waiting nearly 2hrs we finally got a drink of orange juice. Another round of drinks was offered later again juice/water tea or coffee. After nearly 5 hrs we were again offered juice or water. I asked for wine by that stage as sick of juice. To the staff members credit he got it for me. Dinner was offered with a bottle of water only. Once the trays where cleared about finally the drinks trolley with champagne was offered. My seat did not recline correctly and my TV froze twice. The staff are all lovely but there is nothing premium about premium economy. Not enough staff and very slow service. They clearly do not want to offer more than 1 alcoholic drink on an 8hr flight. The seat eventually reclined with the help of staff and was comfortable. Will never pay the cost for premium economy. As no premium food, service , and dirty toilets. The foot rest is poor and the calf rest only very minimally offers support. Emirates premium economy if far superior.",negative
1462,Great in flight experience but pooor customer service otherwise. We had a great inflight experience. The cabin crew was attentive and the plane accommodations were comfortable.

9756,"Book the Cook - fail I bought Premium Economy flights so I could actually request the food that I would like as I get travel sickness and even the smell of airplane food can make me feel queasy. 
The first meal from Melbourne was meant to be bland and came with full spice, making it hard to eat.
The second meal I had booked was a fruit platter and it never arrived at all. I was served the inflight meal with no choice as to what I wanted. I questioned why I didn't get the booked meal and was told it didn't up load from the computer correctly.
I then asked if the second flight would be correct, which they confirmed yes it would. For the inconvenience I was given a voucher for $75 SGD to spend on the next flight.
On the second flight my first requested meal was a fruit platter and it arrived , I thought great, but as it was now heading for 5:00am Melbourne time I fell asleep and the hostess took the meal away before I could eat it and never brought it back. I woke up about 8 hours into our 14 hour flight and asked for some food, only to be brought a left over roll and packet of nuts. I thought well if my next meal does come it will do. 
I had booked pancakes and scrambled eggs but when they served the meals, nope it didn't come, again I asked about our Book the Cook meal and was again told it didn't upload in the system.
We are now trying to Book our return flight food and the system says it's not working. I find this rather poor as we paid more than double the price for the Premium Economy seats with an extra cost to choose the seats as well.  
Although the seats we chose gave me extra leg room and seat width, I guess I will just accept what ever the inflight meal is and hope I can stomach it.",neutral
4913,"Crew service thumb up I will get SQ ticket whenever is within my budget. This round we bring our youngest boy to experience long haul flight A350-900 to Brisbane. We board the flight before other passengers so that we can settle both kids in advance. They did not provide any kids toys for kids at this time. Only one Disney luggage tag on the pocket seat. Our boy feeling unwell when in the flight and we seek advice from the service crew. She is very patient to comfort us and get advice from flight captain. Luckily we can off from the flight. 

From Brisbane to Singapore, we choose to take midnight flight. The crew give each of the passengers a pouch of amenities kit which include of toothbrush, toothpaste and a pair of socks.

5246,"Excellent Service, but issues with new Entertainment System & new seats My feedback was based on both the above-mentioned flight, and the previous flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich.

I flew on SQ328 on 19 May 19 and SQ317 on 3 Jun 19.

1. Professional Cabin Crew and Excellent Service.
I would like to commend the cabin crew on both flights, although I was unable to recall any particular names. Especially on SQ317 from LHR to SIN, the cabin crew serving us during the flight when the lights were dimmed have provided excellent service. My wife and I were very grateful that the crew have been very attentive and expedient to our needs, including requests to fill up our water bottle and for cup noodles during the wee hours.

2. Audio on Entertainment System
I was initially very pleased to get to use the new Krisworld systems installed on both flights (A350 for SQ328 and A380 for SQ317). The touchscreens are definitely a better interface than using manual controllers in older systems. I was also delighted that I could enter my Krisflyer number or email address to create a personal profile. However, the quality of the audio in the new Krisworld system in Economy class left much to be desired. On SQ328 when I first encountered the issue with the audio, I had thought it was only a one-off perhaps due to faulty earphones. However, my concerns were verified on SQ317 when I experienced the same problem with the audio even though I was on a different aircraft and using a different set of earphones. The bass volume in the audio feed was too loud relative to the treble volume. This was especially apparent when listening to music in flight, as it resulted in muffled, unclear, and even flat tones when playing lower pitch sounds. The higher pitch sounds were okay. What made it worse was that the bass and treble volumes could not be adjusted in the settings. There was only one volume bar to adjust.

3. Lack of Footrest
I was rather taken aback that the new economy class seats on the A350 and A380 aircraft now had no footrest.",positive
9087,"Overseas Travel The flight was very nice and considering the time on the plane, the attendants made it quite bearable.  The attendants are very professional and nicely dressed in traditional fashion.  The only downside of the entire experience is the airlines website.

9750,"More training for your staffs please. Travelled with my family to NZ for our holiday last November. The trip to NZ was fine, its the trip back that made us question if we should ever consider flying Singapore airline again. Recently flying SQ we faced the issue of the meal times were always late. This round the meal time was delayed for more than 1 hour, and when the flight attendant was distributing the snacks, I asked if they can spare one more sandwich for my young child, The attendant had turned me down and said they do not have enough food for everyone. For normal circumstances I can be more understanding, however during the whole flight I witnessed the passengers (a family of 3 - parents and a teenager) seated in front of me had been requesting snacks and drink non-stop. If you are worried that you do not have enough food for all, why ain't your staffs trained to turn down the request from passengers that had been requesting food non-stop? And it was my 1st request for an extra sandwich for my young child, and it was due to your delay in meal time. At the end I had to tell my crying child that the airline does not have enough food. 

As a well know airline, shouldn't you planned and stocked enough food for all? And the attitude from the flight attendants were very bad.",negative
6491,Better than the last time Checked in and chose seats on line. Lie flat beds were unsuitable on outward leg from Stockholm so crew told me to try getting specific seats. We did this but at check in were told not possible although we had confirmation. Refused to accept other seats and after I requested a manager and had a discussion with said manager seats suddenly could be allocated. Seats were very good but why the hassle? At Singapore the business class lounge was almost standing room only and food in short supply. I have had better flights from rivals and on this return trip have sadly not been impressed.,neutral
8684,Singapore Airlines - All Smiles No Action My wife and I unfortunately chose Singapore Airlines instead of flying all the way with KLM. Service on outbound flight was good standard however return flight was awful from point of check in. My wife was moved from the allocated paid for seat to sit in middle of four people separated from me. Despite an hour trying to sort out their system issues neither Duty Manager Harwan Bin Jaffar not Eric Foo would rectify the problem - so spent entire flight apart - missed opportunity to make use airport facilities but were offered sweets to make up for mix up !! In flight refused to rectify seating mix up Clifford Chua stated he was governed by Ground Staff - awful service and only one person out of entire Singapore Airline crew offered my wife a complimentary drink to make up for the issue - Mohamad Raimi unfortunately one man unable to change our view on this all smiles but no action airline - will never fly with Singapore Airlines again !,negative

They even brought out a cheese cart at the end of the two main meals!  The wine was great too.  Finally, I loved the selection of films on the monitor.  There were multiple Asian films with English subtitles that are probably available nowhere else.  I look forward to flying Singapore again.",positive

Normally I never finished my meal on board I just took a couple of bites and that’s it but not this year 🥰 it was all so good.

Being in Premium Economy we found it surprising that they were out of a particular meal and the ice-cream when they came to us.  As I say, it can be the little things and these certainly were small in the overall experience.  Service, attentiveness throughout the whole trip, top shelf.  Assistance getting overhead bags organised etc.  Best thing - another small thing however in the air for 14 hours also a big thing.  The loos were constantly cleaned and freshened.

Efficiency of checking in was faultless and always someone around if you did need help. Use them again? 100%,hopefully pretty soon.

Never had a problem with Singapore Airlines.   I consider the food they provide on the inflight menu to be bland and boring so always use Book the Cook to order something different.   The entertainment provided did not offer much to suit our tastes.  Notwithstanding those minor points always happy to recommend this airline.,positive
2589,Consistent & Efficient Smooth and comfortable as always.  Service was attentive and adequately staffed.  Starters (satay skewers) was good.  Special Nasi Padang was a tat cold and chicken drumstick was somewhat small.  What was missing was the traditional condiments like Sambal chilli with anchovies.,positive
605,"Damaged luggage Service on the ground and in the air good but planes and seats very dated. Leg room ok but design of seat still old style - legs have to be curved to one side when lying flat. 

On arrival, one of the wheels of my 4-wheel checked in luggage had fallen off. Didn't have time to report the damage as had another connecting flight to Europe. Took photos and when we got to Europe put in a claim to the airlines. Despite numerous emails (each time received an automated acknowledgment) chasing after the claim and making new claims, nothing has happened. Even rang SIngapore Airlines in Singapore and spoke to customer service. Put in more applications and still nothing. 

If you look at Singapore Airlines' sites in Australia and SIngapore, they are designed not be contactable.  Many of the phone numbers are out dated and ring out. They don't want your opinions. They are not interested in what you think. 

I had a similar issue with a third rate airline many years ago and had the same issue of no follow up after numerous emails and phone calls. I thought SIA is a first rate and premium airline. Most disappointed. It's just another airline with poor customer service. If this is how they approach customer service, how do they approach airline safety?",negative
6736,"Great airline, beautiful airport, pathetic service. Flying to Singapore on Singapore Airlines is something people dream of. We took the flight and loved it, the airport was amazing but when it comes to security and immigration, it appalling.  The airline is great, economy seats are good, pitch is perfect and a guy like me 185cm sits pretty comfortable and I did enjoy the flight. 
The greeting by immigration was like ""why the hell did you just arrive at midnight, I'd better be in bed"". Well, the flight was scheduled to arrive 0010. Sorry guys. 
Three days later we left to Hanoi, again, the security were nasty and bored, hated every moment of their job. 
Then on our way back with transit in Singapore Changi. Straight after landing, we disembarked to find a massive amount of passengers in front of us in a Que, wondering whats happening, we finally saw from distance what's the issue, its security checking passengers just as when boarding!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. We just landed and came out of a plane, what possibly could we have bought or manufactured on board a A330 of Singapore airlines? I travel like 6 to 12 times a year on international and domestic flights. Never ever was I required to go through security after landing, just to go again through security at the departure gate (the same terminal). We were delayed like at least 45 minutes till they cleared the 3 A330s and a 777-200 that just landed, I asked why is this check? The officer replied just a random security check! That resulted in loosing our time to go to the duty free and enjoy the airport facilities.  Had to run to our gate so we won't miss our flight home. But the airline is definitely A1. 
The waste of time of passengers in the name of security will cost the Airport it's reputation and the duty free loosing customers like us, we were looking forward to buy few things but our time was consumed by useless unnecessary checks.",positive
6683,"Inexperienced Pilots My husband is a Miami based International 777 Pilot on another airline. He served as a Captain in the US Air Force and flew the F-16. We boarded and took off as planned. The cabin crew was kind and professional. We were up in the air about 20 minutes and were at 35k feet and food/drink service was about to begin when the pilot announced that due to weather there would be turbulence, buckle up and no food/drink service for the next 1.5-2 hours. It was a harrowing experience and at one point I considered asking my husband to confer with them on a workaround/option. They could have slowed the speed down and/or called in for a variance to move either up or down to get out of the turbulence. They didn't. We were tossed around for almost two full hours. I fly all the time (both domestically and internationally) and my flies for a living. Never have we seen a flight crew that would subject the passengers and the jet to this type of turbulence for such a long period of time. Since our final destination was Bali and we had to change jets at SIN we'd thought about cancelling our return flight via Singapore Airlines and non-revving back through Hong Kong/Dallas. In the end, we weren't able to cancel and paid for the flight home but switched over to American and did the additional flight to HKG/DFW and then worked our way back to Florida. It was a bad experience that could have easily been remedied. They chose not to exercise options for passenger safety. We choose to not fly them again.",negative
6980,"Not the best airlines I never flight with Singapore Airlines before, and always heard it's the best airlines, I compared the ticket with different airlines, finally tried with Singapore Airlines.
Because it's a 15 hours flight, want to have more comfortable flight. My priority is wishing to sleep on the flight. My reviews of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy are listed as follows:
Good
1. Priority Boarding
2. Priority luggage handling - I get my luggage rapidly on the belt within 5 mins after I passed the immigration.
Bad
1. The seat is not comfortable than I expected, feel not much wider than standard economy seat. The seat recliner is fine, the cal rest not so helpful. The control of the seat recliner and cal rest have to do it manually, not like business class which is adjusted by machine without pushing it hard. Although it has 38 inches leg room, it's comfortable, but when I need to go to bathroom, still need to ask the passenger on aisle seat to let me out. Even it's better and comfortable than economy seats, I still not able to sleep during the flight, I think I can only sleep well if I can sleep on a flat bed.
2. The meal - they offer Book the cook, but the food quality is so-so, feel exactly same quality as economy class. They didn't distribute mid flight snacks to you, only water. Also they didn't put the snacks out for self services, you have to ask, I tried to ask for a sandwich and they said it's all gone. Seems they didn't have enough supply for all economy passengers.
3. The bathroom - there are only 5 bathroom for both the Premium economy and Economy passengers. But they have 4 bathrooms for Business class passengers, but not allow for Premium Economy passengers. That's too bad.
4. Just like I read before, there's no designated flight attendant for Premium Economy passengers, so they  treat you just like the economy passengers.
Overall I want to say Singapore Airlines is not the best, personally I think Cathy Pacific or China Airlines are better than Singapore Airlines in terms of foods, services and overall experience.",neutral
6231,"Keeps the high standard  Singapore airlines, better than Thai. Hot towels just after take off and before breakfast is served.  Great variety of entertainment, clean plane and the food is quite good.  Given they beat Thai substantially on price of economy ticket and gave a better product, once I rated Singapore and Thai as equals but now Singapore has taken a clear lead.  Service was great, efficient and friendly, Singapore I think has improved on their already high standard. Well done Singapore airlines in the age of charge the consumer more and give less.",positive
5705,"Friendly and helpful staff The staff made our flight amazing and relaxing. We had our 7 month old child with us and the staff made us and him feel so welcome and calm that the 13 hour flight was relatively easy going.

The plane we boarded on the next flight from Singapore to Perth was likened to a cattle truck. Tatty seats uncomfortable , the tv were not working for hardly anyone . Children were standing on seats and parents and children were walking up the isles.
Obviously there was no room to nurse a child and I felt sorry for them . Yes I had come off a premium flight of 17 hours but the last five hours of flying on this flight was awful. I won’t fly that route again or with them. The staff were great rushed of their feet.",negative

The added bonus for me was the Singapore Sling served as a complimentary drink. The crew were lovely and attentive regularly circulating with trays of water and juice.

972,"Poor meals I recently travelled with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane too Zurich and have done so many times on the last 20 years. I have always been happy with the service and food provided and do not usually complain. But on my last flight I found the food offerings on the Brisbane too Singapore flight to be lacking, we were served one meal (lunch) and a couple of rounds of drinks for the entire 8 hour flight. I understand two meals may not be feasible on such a flight but in years gone by a snack or 'light refreshement' was always served a couple of hours from Singapore and vice versa. 
I also don't find using Covid a valid excuse for cutting the inflight food service as other airlines such as Emirates and Qatar and even Qantas still serve a full meal and snack on flights of similar lengths. 
I hope Singapore Airlines improves there catering offerings in the future as one meal for 8 hours is definitely not 5 stars!!!",neutral
5663,"Amazing We had a nightmare trip due to my husband's eardrum perforating half an hour into the flight, the aircrew was stunning, caring, helpful and attentive during the flight to Singapore - arranged medical assistance, I can't say enough about them, will definitely be flying with Singapore air again.",positive

His professional and sincerity in helping made my flight experience very pleasant.  i also noticed that he will go the extra mile to ensure all passengers' needs were met.

MsPham thi     Hoang Anh,told me that Israelis must show their departure flight from Switzerland. Israeli citizens do not need exit flight tickets from Switzerland.

She updated me that she had called the manager of Singapore Airlines and it would take him more than two hours. Maybe more I told her I would miss my flight. I felt I was having a heart attack! I asked him to give me the boarding pass. She refused!

We did receive compensation but we were offered two gestures of good will. Neither of which we could use. Two meal vouchers as we had missed the evening meal but we were given them as we were boarding. Also in flight gift vouchers were offered. We received these 2 weeks after we got home !!! We were told we could order things from their shop and it would be delivered to our home. But we have to pay duty & postage and can only select from a very limited selection. Great PR !!!!!,negative

2903,"Charming Crew, arrived early- food disappointing Saturday 26th October and our stay in Singapore was over and it was time to return to Goa via Mumbai.

We were travelling on board Singapore Airlines flight SQ 424 to Mumbai which was scheduled to Depart at 19.00 and arriving in Mumbai 22.10, Mumbai 2 hours and 30 minutes behind Singapore

A scheduled 5 hours and 40 minute flight

Like our outbound flight we were travelling in Premium Economy cabin.

We were seated in the second row of the Premium Economy Cabin, seat 32 A and C. The opposite side to the Cabin for our outward journey.

Normally the configuration in the cabin is 2 - 4 - 2, there was no seating in the middle row, for the first few rows, to make room for the staircase, which led to the upstairs area of the aircraft, an A380 800. The space underneath the stairs was used as storage cupboard space by the cabin crew, this was right beside my seat. The crew visited there on numerous occasions during the flight. This was rather irritating as the door rattled when opened and closed and a bright light shone when door opened, even worse when cabin lights were dimmed. Unlike the outbound flight the cabin crew were aware of this and did their best to keep the noise to a minimum.

We did also preorder our meal online, herb roasted chicken, which was served on a bed of black lentils. Sorry it was not very appetising and very disappointing and was not eaten.

We landed at 21.30, which was 40 minutes earlier than scheduled, which is always good news.

The cabin crew provided a courteous and efficient high level of service. 

This was a better flight that the outbound flight on Friday 18th October. 

Would certainly fly with Singapore Airlines again and would use the Premium Economy Cabin but would select seats further back in the cabin.",positive
333,"Don't bother with premium economy - poor experiance and not worth the money Paid $500 for a premium economy update. Was not worth it. Headrest on seat was broken and wouldn't go up. Footrest and seat both designed for short people and useless and uncomfortable for someone 183cm tall. Footrest spring and wouldn't support my legs anyway. Uncomfortable and not worth the money. Poor sleep compounded by cabin service - see below.

Infotainment worked well but screen was offset in my seat and so far away the screen was effectively tiny.

Checkin was painless albeit clunky on a smartphone with a pre smartphone era process.

Onboarding was bizarre in surabaya with an attendant using a poor quality belt amplifier and microphone to blare incomprehensible instructions at passengers. 

Boarding the a380 and then waiting 20mins for take-off was very slow- downside of a large plane most probably. Egress and baggsge was also slow probably also due to the size of the aircraft.

There was no food choice from surabaya as the better smelling option ran out. The laksa was average but the included bread roll was gross and tasted like it was full of sugar and preservatives and baked a week ago. The cake was also sickly sweet. Would have preferred some healthy food although a meal order may be a way to achieve this.

Order of serving passengers was also seemingly random on both flights. Waited 10 mins while passengers in front, beside and behind were served and yet others were waiting.

Most irritating part of the a380 flight was being knocked and brushed against by the stewardess 20 times for an overnight flight without leaning into the aisle significantly. Use of a quiet voice at night time would have been great too. This problem could be mitigated by avoiding the a380 seats with extra legroom - I had no choice as other passengers had already selected seats.",neutral

4144,"AMAZING STAFF AND LEGROOM To start, Singapore Airlines contacted me before my flight saying that they have changed my seat to an economy seat which has extra legroom (due to the seat in front being missing). This was AMAZING as I had a very comfortable flight!!

I must say that the staff in Singapore Airlines are very welcoming and are friendly. They also are very helpful during the flight as well as before departure and once arriving. They offer eyeshades and other amenities at request for economy and to get these you need to ask the cabin crew to get these. 

Our flight departed LHR at 22:00 and arrived in SIN at around 6pm. Our a 13 hour flight was perfect- enough legroom for my son who's 6ft 2in tall (although the person in front must also have their seat reclined for this to be comfortable). The food service was impeccable; staff were very quick at serving food and cleaning up so we could grab a bit of shuteye. The IFE was quite outdated as the screen was not touchscreen - if this was updated I would say this is the best flight in economy ever!! Also, it's quite difficult to see whether the toilets are vacant or not as the sign is too small and difficult to see from afar (especially when the cabin is dark). 

Also the passenger who was previously in the toilet before me did not flush the toilet. Perhaps in newer aircraft automatically-flushing toilets or sensor-flushing toilets would be good as this was a bit of a bummer (both metaphorically and actually😂)

Overall, GREAT SERVICE, LOVELY STAFF, GOOD FOOD but aircraft IFE needs to be improved for economy flights to and from SIN - retrofitting may be a good option!!",positive

4581,"Pretty average In comparison to other airlines' Premium Economy, Singapore Aiirline's would rank fairly low. In fairness, the cost of their premium economy is a fraction of those others. So if you're simply after more leg room and a better recline, then you'll be fine. But if you're expecting anything more than that, you'll be sorely disappointed.
I actually found the seat rather uncomfortable. More so than the economy seats of other airlines. But again, in fairness, given a choice of the better recline and leg room, I would take that over the comfort of the other economy seats.
Interestingly, the main difference in the P. Economy offered by Singapore Airlines compared to that offered by others s that other airlines basically offer business class service with their P Economy so it's like flying business with the business class seat of yesterday. Singapore Airlines basically offers economy class service with their P Economy so it's like flying economy with the business class seat of yesterday.

2787,"Disappointing experience on Los Angeles --> Singapore --> Delhi Flight I have flown multiple times (using a multitude of airlines) from the US to other destinations around the world. Although quirky, my airline of choice has been Turkish (due to their in flight service, entertainment and the food, which I find above average). I had to make a trip from Los Angeles to Delhi (India) and decided to check out Singapore Airlines as I had heard so much about their food and entertainment. The flying time on this sector is extremely long as the flight (SQ 11) makes a stop at Narita in Tokyo for an hour, before proceeding to Singapore. 

Let me just say that I was really disappointed - the food was among the worst I have eaten in economy. Bland pasta and hard fish soaked in an unappetizing sauce - really bad! The dessert was just an ice-cream. In contrast Turkish Airline's food in economy is just fantastic. Great kebabs, chicken, excellent warm rolls, tasty dessert... and the ticket costs less (while the travel time is shorter by many hours). The only saving grace was that I had pre-ordered a Hindu Non-Veg meal on one of the sectors and it was delicious. So I guess the trick is to pre-order a meal if flying via Singapore Airlines. 

The entertainment was lacking too - most of the 'new releases' were old and tired movies and the selection was very limited. Even Turkish Airlines offers a wide selection of movies (and they really do have 'new releases'). The FAs were great and polite - so no issues on that front. It was odd that they never offered an amenity kit to passengers (which Turkish offers to all). 

In conclusion, I am glad I tried it once, but would never fly with Singapore Airlines again. I am not sure how people find this airline to be good (and how has it won so many awards) - the only thing I can think of is that people haven't flown with some of the other airlines. And am now dreading the long return trip back to the US (23 hours flying time) with them in a few weeks. Maybe I will just pay for the extra-legroom seat and pre-order my meals.",negative
7321,amazing trip Singapore airlines were excellent on all our flights. Good food and excellent service throughout. would definitely recommend.,positive
5049,"The Longest nonstop flight in the World I flight a lot around the world ans since this route was opened I had in my list this flight, finally it happens in may this year... and in fact it was an excellent flight, very friendly staff by checking in and on board  the service was rewarding.... comfortable seats, attentive cabin staff. Although it is over 18 hour flight the time was not that boring and I arrived full of energy. On the way back I use the route via Frankfurt and service on A380 was also very good.!",positive

410,"Disappointing This was a very disappointing experience considering the hype around the SQ soft and hard product in business.  Firstly let me say the Silverkris Lounge at Changi T3 was excellent. It was the highlight of my flight.  Normally the lounge is just the teaser with the inflight experience the main event.  Unfortunately the inflight experience was just disappointing.  At pre-departure I was offered a juice or champagne and I asked for water.  The FA literally told me to just drink from my water bottle.  No big deal but just not the right tone to set in a premium cabin.  Then there is the seat.  I flew the a380 with their new a380 business seats which i just didn’t like.  I found the seat uncomfortable and the seat padding pretty hard.  Their seat configuration was just really limited and the seat buttons very unresponsive when pressing them.  This was a night flight and this seat is just a terrible for sleeping.  The design when in flat bed mode forces you to lie on an angle  which was very awkward and uncomfortable.   The “seat cover” provided was very thin and no padding meaning you felt all the padding and upholstery of the seat which was just not very soft or giving.  The blanket provided was just too small and meant that either my arms or my feet were sticking out the entire time.  The seat looks good but for me was a total functional fail for comfort and awful for sleeping.  Sadly the food service was a real let down on this flight as well.  I “booked the cook” for my meal which certainly raised my expectations but what I got was average, bland  noodles that looked no different from the other inflight offerings.  My travel companion took the inflight breakfast offering and this was literally one of the worst meals not just in business but in any cabin class.  The scrambled eggs were quite literally inedible.  A goopy stream of “bits” of egg that must surely have been powdered or reconstituted egg,  It was just disgusting.  Totally unbelievable offering on a business class flight.  Whilst the flight was on time and the FAs polite and efficient I would not fly SQ business again unless it was a discounted ticket and I would be very hesitant even then to book a night flight on the a380 with this seat.",neutral
2506,"World Class Airline Not my first time flying in SQ, never disappoints me for their tip-top services. The crews are very helpful and attentive. In-flight entertainments were good enough to accommodate my 6 hours+ flight. Although the legroom is not as spacious as Emirates, it is still comfortable enough. Always a pleasant experience to fly with this airline.",positive
4421,"The return leg of a previously reviewed flight with SQ Recently I had reviewed an overnight flight on SQ288 from Canberra to Singapore accompanied by my wife to escape the below zero mornings in Canberra during winter . Canberra , the capital of Australia , is at an average altitude of 650 metres and is surrounded by the mountains that lead up to the Australian Alps , where our snowfields are . We will have snow once or twice a year on our front lawn which lasts for 6-12 hours . Our four year old male Labrador who weighs 48 kilos , all muscle , thinks the cold is lovely as one of his grandfathers was imported from Finland for breeding .  I crack the ice with my knuckles on his water bowl in the morning .
Anyway , the return leg of SQ 288 from Singapore to Canberra, with a stop of just over one hour in Sydney brought us back to minus one degree in Canberra .
SQ 288 departs Singapore at 10.30 am  , arrives in Sydney at just after 8 pm , although enormous tail winds brought us in at 7.40 pm , to wait for a 9.30 pm departure to Canberra, arriving at 10.20 pm .
It then heads back direct to Singapore at 11.15 pm arriving at 5.15 am Singapore time . All previously mentioned times were local at their ports .
All passengers from Singapore are off loaded at Sydney , with those finishing at Sydney leaving and going out through the usual channels .
Those going on to Canberra are diverted into a separate channel to re-enter the normal concourses , except that you must go through another luggage check inspection by Australian staff before you are released to await the flight to Canberra .
Just what you want after getting up about 5 am , going to Changi airport and then catching SQ 288 for a 10.30 am takeoff for the 8 hour flight to Sydney .
This flight appears to often take off from B 9 in Terminal 3 so we were pre warned that it was a longggg walk from the SQ lounge or the main shop areas . Be warned .
Regarding the shops, be aware that Singapore is anti smoking , with penalties for dropped butts and a recent law that corrals the Orchard/Scott’s Roads vicinities into dedicated smoking areas . These areas are in the open , with no shade nor cover , marked by painted lines . Enough said . I am not sure if it is enforced all over the island . I have never smoked but I pity my poor wife . 
On the subject of nicotine be very aware that Singapore does not appear to allow the sales of some nicotine-containing medications to replace actual cigarette use from pharmacies . My wife , a mild smoker , more nervous , carries an aerosol nicotine-containing spray Nicorette spray . You spray it under your tongue .
As my wife was running out of her supply after three weeks away we visited a local pharmacy where the pharmacist told us that the spray was not available in Singapore, but they could offer the same name in a lozenge to suck or a patch to wear .
My wife has tried both of those and the patch brings up bloody wheals on her skin whilst the oral dose causes gastric irritation . 
She would usually use the oral spray on long haul planes, but had run out on her second last day . Fortunately, during the transit time in Sydney I was able to rush to a pharmacy near the boarding gate and buy one for her .
Back at Changi airport , it does have dedicated areas where , open to the air , smokers can satisfy their craving.  Two things to remember . 
My wife had used all her cigarettes at the place that we were staying at and thought that she could buy a small packet at the airport duty free to get her blood levels up before the flight .
Tricky , as the major retailer who owns the shops will only sell a minimum of three packs of 20 you have a problem . Australia only allows one lot of 25 back in duty free .
Begrudgingly I bought the three packs , my wife went into the smoking lockup and got her blood levels up , and then kept the open pack and gave away the other two packs to the smoker who seemed to be the only one in the crowd who had a lighter .
Do you know that it seems impossible to buy a light or matches inside Changi .
No shop seemed to have them , we tried .
Anyway , overall Singapore has the cheapest and best taxis in the world , each driver is helpful and eager to practise his English , they all have meters and think you are crazy if you tip , not a Singaporean practice , jewellery shops seem happy to discount certified Jade by 80 percent , and it is hot and humid .
Maccas are spotless and more tasty than those in other countries .
Alcohol and car prices are ridiculous but saw more Mercedes , McLarens and Lamborghinis  than in fashionable Sydney suburbs .
The flight , comfortable , food ok and the drinks ok on daytime flights .
My steak was very palatable but cutting it was like trying to cut up a rubber eraser.
Staff always pleasant, my wife , a movie buff , was not impressed by the choice .
Typical huge SQ Business seats but I still cannot work out the controls after many flights . One major annoyance with the food table . Because of the layout of the Business seat the table rises from an angled side wall and will not swing around in front of you , so that you have to eat at 45 degrees . If I had short arms it would be fine but I am tall so have long arms and have to eat with my elbows up around my ears .
I just wish Qantas would fly out of Canberra internationally with big planes , rather than out of Sydney or Melbourne",positive
8766,"A great way to fly! It was a treat to fly home to Singapore from NYC after a 12 day business trip in Suites. I usually fly Business and the inflight service and hard product are already very good.  In Suites, the service was a notch higher than in Business (if that is at all possible). The food was also a notch higher than in Business (which is already very good). The Suites product (the first generation suites product) is still very good.  The full length bed was extremely comfortable. All of this led to an excellent flight.",positive
5408,"World class service I would like to compliment the crews on the flight SQ 387 from Barcelona to Singapore. It was such an exceptional experience as compared to any other airlines that I had been on.

I was welcomed into the aircraft by a steward named Reuben, whom had shown a welcoming smile and pointed me in the direction to my seat.

I had sprained my right ankle as I was travelling through Barcelona the day before, up till the flight, I was still walking with a slight limp. I guessed that the slight limp had caught the keen attention of the crews as I was walking to my seat. They had checked for my well-being with empathy and politeness, offered me a change of seats to ensure better convenience which I had declined.

Shortly after the first meal service, the crew had made an ice pack for my ankle and it came along with a small towel. It was a great relief as the walking that happened before the flight had caused my ankle to swell even more. The ice pack was changed for a total of 5 times throughout the flight by different cabin crews. They had been so consistent with their sincere and genuine service by doing so.

They had also informed me that should I require any assistance for the movement around the aircraft, I could always press the “call” button to alert them, and they would ask the steward to assist me as soon as possible. Even though I had not asked for this assistance during the flight, it was such a warm gesture and an extra mile in service. I was not sure if all the crews in Singapore Airlines had this level of service, but the crews on this flight had definitely set the bar for me.

I would like to specially commend these crews Eileen, Pek Yun, Rong Yan, Ee Hua, Charles, Pantha and Sanjani. They had shown me their utmost care and concern in absolute kindness and professionalism throughout the 13 hours of the flight. They had managed to make this flight as enjoyable and comfortable for me to the best of their efforts.

The flight had departed smoothly and arrived on time with a great landing, thanks to Captains Morgan and John, and Senior First Officer Jeremy in the flight deck.

I would like to thank the airline, the in-flight manager and the crews for making this wonderful experience possible. I would definitely share this experience with others and would surely travel with Singapore Airlines again.",positive
5952,"Very disappointing  We traveled from Melbourne to Singapore premium economy. I have flown premium economy previously with Virgin Australia and you could not compare the two services. We were not offered a drink before takeoff-on Virgin you are offered champagne or water. The cabin crew also serviced the economy section as well as premium economy but with Virgin you have your own designated premium economy crew. The food was terrible-a doughy pastry and that was all-it was an overnight flight but would have expected something lighter and tastier. This food was the same as economy so no different. Virgin serves you individually and you are given crockery and cutlery not plastic. Also cabin was not really separated from economy- they didn’t even close the curtain dividing the two areas! Also we had to use the economy toilets as there are none in premium economy-Virgin have designated toilets. The seats were spacious but other than that, I am not sure why we paid double the economy fare for this premium economy. Virgin also have a cabinet filled with snacks and drinks which you can help yourself to during the flight -nothing available on Singapore. A generally disappointing experience and definitely not worth the extra money.",negative
5714,"Wonderful Experience The overall experience made the trip an enjoyable one.

5333,"Singapore Airlines A380---better that A350..but still inferior In my previous review of the A350 flight to Christchurch, I pointed out that their business class seats were most uncomfortable for stretching out or sleeping, as one could not stretch out straight or lie straight; \but at an acute angle. I expected more from the A380 and was disappointed ; once again you could only stretch at an angle. The angle was less steep in this aircraft and there was better support. The seat belt arrangement too, was better and not uncomfortable. But when Qatar, Emirates, Etihad etc can give you seats that stretch out straight and are super comfortable when fully flat, I wonder why SQ chose such an awkward seat design.
The SQ service was , of course, top notch,though one thing stumped me. I ordered a cappucino after lunch; the stewardess brought it and left it on my table without any sugar or a stirrer. I assumed sugar was already added; and tasted it...no sugar. So I had to buzz for sugar and a stirrer. Intrigued, and wondering whether it was just an oversight by my stewardess, I asked my wife to order one. Can you believe it, the same thing happened!",neutral
2323,"Professional but expensive I have flown out by Singapore Airlines many times and among the airlines plying on that sector Singapore Airlines would probably rank above some others. I like their regimentation for boarding as it cuts the confusion that gets created in the isles of the airplane. The food served from Singapore to Melbourne which I travelled in premium economy lacked taste and its presentation was poor. Flying out of its base - Singapore, using a caterer that can add a taste of Singapore would improve the food quality. The premium economy provided slightly larger seat and recline was perhaps a wee bit more than that on economy – not a flat bed. Even on premium economy one shares the toiletso the wait can be long. Instead of earphone I got head phones and leg rest but at what cost.  As regards beverage, Smirnoff Vodka ranks at the bottom of Vodka's and that is what I had which I left and changed over to a reasonably OK red wine. The sector from Singapore to Melbourne should cater for one to two more variety of red and white wine as the travellers on that sector are more exposed to drinking wines especially in the premium economy.",neutral
738,"Bad customer service/ good inflight service I have a mixed review for SIA. The inflight service was excellent and the staff on the both to and from Kuala Lumpur were excellent. However, the customer service in Changi is terrible. Our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore was delayed by 50 minutes and SIA had changed their schedule, so we had a 10 hour stop-over at Changi. Our request for a meal vopucher or the use of a lougnge was refused. Apparently SIA no longer provides meal vouchers.

Received an email from Singapore Airlines on an upgrade which cost EUR384/pax/per trip. So I quickly jump in and paid, however when I receipt the email, then did I noticed that it was an upgrade for premium economy only. I felt sad and wanted to request to change back to original seats, however was unable to, and also had a hard time trying to contact customer service team of Singapore Airlines.

Cons: Expensive, the huge price difference between SQ economy and the Premium Economy doesn't match with the service/seat upgrade you get. In-flight wifi is expensive and limited compared to other airlines. Uploading or downloading a single picture on Wifi did not work on my 13+ hour flight due to slow speeds.

6994,"Not the Best I hadn't flown Singapore Airlines for about 30 years, so decided I should try them again. To be honest, I wish I hadn't. In the past I had found them to be pretty good but over recent years have flown Cathay and Virgin. 
On all four legs of my flight, I had selected (and paid extra) for the front row of Premium Economy. The extra leg room was great. When boarding my flight from Singapore to Melbourne, I found a woman and her child in my seat. I had to argue with her to return to her ticketed seat. Non of the cabin crew came to assist. That aside, I would have to say the whole Premium experience with Singapore Airlines fell way below that of other airlines.No welcome drink, a WAY below average amenities travel pack, no dedicated toilet, no dedicated staff, poor on-board service, and not clean! (I had to clean the tray table that the previous traveller had spilt red wine all over).

I chose Singapore Airlines as their flight times suited my itinerary, but, for the extra price paid, I would be reluctant to fly them again.",neutral

I flew economy to Australia as my family were in economy and my return was in premium economy.Economy seats are ok you just get a little extra leg room in premium plus you get off the plane a little sooner and you can book the chef also you are given noise cancelling headphones which are great,the amount of onboard entertainment is emended.All in all economy is ok.The cabin crew on board are very attentive and regularly come around with water or fruit juice for hydration.The meals are alway good with a good selection depending on where you are seated sometimes the meal is unavailable but they ensure on the next round of meals they start serving at the other end so you don’t miss out a second time.The cabin staff are always kind and courteous.One other thing that impressed me was the toilets,on some other long haul airlines I have flown on don’t pay attention to the cleanliness of the facilities which can get very untidy and wet under foot.The toilets seemed to be cleaned and stocked up on a regular basis with mouth wash and hand cream available.I would not hesitate to recommend this airline",positive

I spent over two hours on the phone trying to sort it out - then was asked to prove they had debited my Visa account - I said excuse me are you saying i am lying ? Then I asked for a supervisor, they didn't want the escalation. Reason, because I ran a 4000 person call centre - they lose points if they don't resolve it, bad luck about me and their attitude. I got the supervisor and he looked at the copy of the transaction i sent. Then 20 minutes later after rubbish music someone came back to me and said Finance will get back to you - when oh in 4 days time.

Menu has a starter, choice of 3 mains and a dessert, plus cheese and crackers. Limited wine choice of 1 white (Sav Blanc)and 1 red (Cab Sav), though it does include champagne. Food choices are pretty much the same as economy. Generally we enjoyed the food, but chicken salad starter had chicken so overcooked it couldn't be cut let alone eaten. The not so good. We had 2 lots of 2 x 10 hr flights and the firm seats were getting rather uncomfortable by the end of all flights. No toilet specifically for Premium Economy passengers, just use the economy ones with everyone else. Seats slightly wider with each row being 2 x 4 x 2. Seats do recline a little more than economy, but when the person in front of you reclines their seat and you are dinning, you can still end up with your wine being knocked over and food pushed on to the floor. Person in the aisle seats still has to get out to let the person beside them get out. Only the front row has more leg room. There is a box (possibly the entertainment box) that sits under all the aisle seats which limits foot room. Good variety of

3184,"Very pleasant experience, if you can afford it :-( Late overnight flight to LHR, departing Singapore. Krisflyer lounge at T3 was really quite busy for that time of night - so don't look for a relaxed peaceful experience. Boarding was efficient, as always. Flying on A380-800 version 3, which comes with the latest 2017 J seating (see MainlyMiles.com for more details). Business class on an all-upper deck configuration. The cabin is missing the centre row of luggage compartments, which gives the cabin a very airy spacious feel. The seating is really luxurious, with ample storage space and the latest touch screen IFE boasting crystal clear vision for those of you who *must* watch these things. Seats have a privacy divider for the centre aisles, which allows you to interact or shelter from your neighbour. The wraparound wings on the seat give you great privacy overall, if that is your wish. Seat controls are electronic and allow you to configure your seat in multiple positions, including the lie flat position. A pair of noise cancelling headphones is provided. I found the lie-flat seats perfectly comfortable, but other feedback was that due to the slant angle, it was slightly difficult to get a comfortable position. All other aspects of service were as good as SQ usually achieves, but then, to be honest, I am not very demanding there - a friendly smile will tick the boxes for me! There is no denying that the price of business class is high on SQ (very high??!), but if you get the new layout, I think this is a really special way to travel.",positive

3940,"Excellent service We flew Singapore Airlines from Heathrow to Adelaide via Singapore using both the airbus 380 and the dreamliner. The 380 was a brilliant and extremely comfortable plane with plenty of legroom including rockers for your feet, this aircraft was far superior to the dreamliner which we took to and from Changi to Adelaide although this was also a comfortable plane. The service provided throughout all flights was beyond reproach with in flight food and drinks on tap served by the politest staff you can imagine. 5star treatment even in economy class.",positive

1286,"They used to be the best, but not any more! Due to Covid, my husband and I have been in separate countries for the last 7 months, him in Cambodia me in Vietnam.  My husband was due to fly from Phnom Pneh to LA this weekwhere I would meet him and we would then travel on to Mexico, but because of the ineptitude and attitudes of ground staff at PP this has not happened.  We have been in constant contact with the airline since then requesting a refund - they refused him a boarding pass, saying because he travels on a UK passport then he is not allowed entry into the US.  This is totally wrong, he only cannot travel to US if he has been in UK in the last 14 days (remember, he's been in Cambodia for the last 7 months).  Yesterday I got that in writing from the US embassy in PP. 
I won't got into the attitude given - that's for another time and place.  Back to the refund - they either want to charge us a cancellation fee, or we have to wait until they 'conduct a full investigation' before they will 'consider' issuing a full refund.  This is not acceptable treatment from a 5 star airline, and far from what we would expect from Singapore Air",negative

6360,"The non-stop between Newark and Singapore was an expensive personal disappointment! I can't believe that I spent so much of my own money (over US$7000 RT) for the convenience of a non-stop that was so uncomfortable that I didn't get a moment's sleep (in either direction).  Nor could I sit comfortably!  In my opinion, the seat design is weird and requires one to twist one's body in order to sleep flat or even sit.  I noticed that the leg support only supported 3/4 of the seat so one leg was essentially unsupported -- when it worked.  And on my flight between SIN and EWR the leg support malfunctioned and wouldn't stay elevated.  There was only one other seat to move to in that section of business class so I guess the seat issues don't seem to bother other passengers.  But honestly, I would have been happier paying for United Polaris service with a stop than to be subject to these seats for so many hours!!!  For the sake of full disclosure, there are a handful of seats in Business Class where it is possible to sit and lie with a straight spine.  Even though I asked for one of these and they were available at the time I booked back in August, SIA said they were reserved for mothers traveling with infants.  Well, in reality, on my flights these seats were occupied by businessmen who must have had greater clout than me!  I was not very happy....  SIA are reputed to have the best service in the air and that was fine.  But this was business class and NOT first class and I thought that this was nothing special....  The meals were ok and not great.  The western dishes were almost accompanied by bland carrots and green beans which were too al dente for me to chew.  I was slightly happier with the Asian meals.  Further, the cabin crew made no effort on either flight to ask whether non-sleeping passengers would like any of the snack options.  Nor did I see the packaged ones on a tray where people could help themselves...  But what really got me is that there were no amenities to speak of on the way back to EWR whereas there was a kit on the flight to Singapore.  I asked for some lip balm and was told that there wasn't any on board.  I protested saying that I was given some on the flight between EWR and SIN (although I had to ask for some because it wasn't in the kit).  It blew me away when I was informed that lip balm is a First Class item and we were, after all, only in Business Class.  I consider that to not be a luxury on a 17 hour flight!!!  And then I was informed that the kits were only being handed out in the first 90 days of service but, in fact, my outbound flight had been 3 1/2 months after the initiation of this service....  To the credit of the crew serving my area of the cabin, they appreciated how miserable I was and offered a very small service recovery gesture.  It was a kind gesture and probably all they could do inflight but it was woefully inadequate considering the value of my airfare.  I'm sure there are enough business people whose companies are willing to pay for the non-stop service but for me this was a SABENA (for those old enough to remember: Such A Bad Experience Never Again)!!!",neutral

7394,"Good but inconsistent service My family of five have had good experiences while travelling on flight number SQ346  on a A380 from Singapore to Zurich in Switzerland  on 18 December for our holiday in Europe from 18-27 December 2018. The service on our first encounter provided by flight stewards were amazing and lived up to the high standards of Singapore Airlines especially by Mr Teo Ming Zhong and his colleagues whom we were deeply impressed. Food were great and services were first class. However, on our return night flight on Singapore Airlines via SQ321 also on a A380 on 26 December, the service provided was a let down though. Food were as good anyway as expected of SIA. The flight stewardesses attended us were of sub standard quality where simple requests like asking to remove used cups and little food containers at the very moment when they came over to serve main courses were met with blunt refusals and excuses like "" I can't do it now as I am serving food"" and the like. My request to redeem the small fruit pack were also turned down after I missed my turn when I was asleep and woke up to see the handing out of the same had just passed me a few seats in front. Reply given was there wasn't anymore left. When I insisted my share as I observed many were also bypassed during the serving round and there had to be some more available and fair enough, one of the flight attendants came back minutes later with a pack and told me on my face that this was the only one left. As the flight was a long haul of 13 hours continuous flight, I took the trouble of walking around the cabin area for some simple stretching and  went  to the loo and to my surprise, I saw the same little fruit packs were available in abundance both at the serving area in front of our seating section and also at the upper deck serving area together with the packets nuts, crackers, biscuits and buns. This is displeased to say the least. The service I encountered this time round was a far cry compared with the  experience I had on 18 December. In addition to the bad experience of the 2 young flight stewardesses, one of the toilets at the far end on the plane has no water for washing hands and a bottle of mineral water was used as a replacement and most of the time it was emptied and no one was filling it up. I hope that being part of a group tour and be seated at the far end of a plane would not be the reason for the indifferent quality of service provided.",neutral
8219,"Fantastic flight to Denpasar Travelled on Singapore Airlines Flight SQ 942 from Singapore to Denpasar-Bali in the first week of November.

The aircraft was a brand new 787-10 - vibrant and fresh-looking aircraft. As in Singapore Changi T2, the security screening took place at the boarding area. We were given a customs declaration form post security screening which had to be shown to the authorities at Ngurah Rai International Airport.

As I was arriving from Ahmedabad and connecting to Denpasar, I unfortunately can't comment on the check-in part.

Once inside, the experience was wonderful. Hot towels were given to passengers of all classes, hot meal (brunch) was served. Being vegetarian, a special meal (Vegetarian Indian Meal) was served to me, which was tasty.

The flight departed on time and landed on time, too. The landing was good. Cabin Crew were all smiles and helpful and efficient. 

Recommend Singapore Airlines for a comfortable journey.",positive
4114,"I heard it was the best, but After 4 long flights(2 each way on Singapore) and the 4 short flights (2 each way on other airlines) we made it to our destination. We had a 16.5 hour flight from San Francisco to Singapore and then a  10 hour flight to Johannesburg. Long flights, one flight crew was better than the other, but I can't remember which. One had their act together and their other seemed like they were in training.  That being said, it must be hard for the employees to work such a long flight, I give them all kudos for that.

Will definitely use them again next year.",positive

9976,"Good time to check in Was a good flight just took a bit of sorting, we originally booked to fly from Wellington to Singapore via Canberra and arranged hotels to suit, however Singapore airlines changed their schedule to Tavel via Melbourne instead and leave a day earlier (thank goodness for travel insurance) Good time of day to depart 1.30 pm and a nice short 3 1/2 flight and stretch our legs for 1 1/2 hours. The next leg was also a relatively easy 7 1/2 hours arriving @10.30pm local time. I find the seats and legroom on the Singapore Boeing 777 much better than other airlines (they use a 3-3-3 wide seat configuration not the tight 3-4-3. Food was good (for airline food) good service, very polite and helpful cabin staff, good baggage allowance 30kg. The restrooms were kept really clean throughout the flight. Good flight from Wellington, I will use this again both to Singapore and to Melbourne, easy and hassle free and good arrival times at both stops. Flight left and arrived on time.

I’ve been trying to book my first class plane ticket for over four months and I cannot get any answers out of anyone. All they do is hang up on me and I am being really nice? They cannot speak good English so I’m very patient and kind and they always put me on hold for long periods of time and then hang up. I can say, I wish I never transferred my miles to Singapore because this will be my last trip I ever do and I have not even gotten off the ground yet! We are so excited about flying Singapore but after the ground experience I am not so sure that this is going to be as good as we thought? I have the miles and the money but they just want to overcharge me for a first class ticket from LAX to BKK. The system will only let you book the last segment because it is business class so all you should have to do is call and ask to add the last segment at no extra miles but I always want to charge more miles and more money! Can anyone help at Singapore airlines?",negative
2825,"Enjoyable Business Class Experience Osaka to Singapore A relatively short but enjoyable overnight flight. 

Check-in only starts around 2.5hrs before departure. For business class passengers, you get a choice of using either the JAL Sakura Lounge or some restaurants as the lounge gets very crowded with a couple of airlines using it. However, I don't think a crowded lounge is of any big issue to me as long as I can get a seat, in which mostly, people do. Offerings wise quite standard but not too bad overall. Three different type of beers available and spirits and Japanese plum wines. 

As having been on the Dreamliner several times in business, hence, seat is pretty good as usual. As flight time is only around 6 hours and they offer a sleeper service in which you can have your meal either after take off or 2.5hrs before touch down in which they will wake you up. I selected right after take off and had the hot soba with tempura, changing from the famous Hanakoireki as the outbound from SIN didn't taste as good as expected. The soba definitely tasted very good. 

Something happened just before meal service (I will not say it..haha) but as a result, chatted with the crew, the IFM Ms. E. Chan whom was really amazing. She is probably the second best ever SIA crew I ever encountered and ask her about the sleeper service as it did say passenger can choose to have a meal after take off or 2.5hrs before landing or both. I asked how does 'both' works and she say if there are remaining, they will try to serve passenger requesting for second, but she say will wake me up for the second meal. Second time round try the Hanakoireki and it certainly tasted much better than the outbound from SIN one, and being a supper service, it was half the portion which was just enough.",positive

Then at last minute they switched me and did not seem to care about my medical condition that could result in DVTs  and Pulmonary embolisms on this 18 hour flight. They asked for medical proof, which was sent, and they then ignored the medical need. So so very disappointed. They know I am very prone to blood clots and have a high probability of getting one yet they gave. Away the special seat that would prevent such a problem, a seat I waited for months to get . Also separated me from my wife when they switched my seat. So for 18 hours we are now at opposite ends of the plane.",negative

Like many passengers have reviewed, no more hot towel service, a few items taken off the meal tray and reduced baggage allowance. During a recent flight back from Osaka-KIX, the meal tray really look embarrassing for a top notch airline. It was Japanese curry rice which consist of 4 very small pieces of beef cubes, 3 small cubes of potato and 2 slices of carrot, with plenty of gravy on top of an onigiri sized rice; there is a bun with butter, a packet of biscuit with cheese spread and ice cream. If cost is an issue, I guess just provide each passenger a packet of Hainan chicken rice or Nasi Lemak, which probably will look more presentable and representative of SG.",neutral

It was a decent experience in Business Class, but not my best ever.  They have a separate entrance for business class.  Your ticket is checked as you enter and as you seat.   The FA's were helpful smiled.   The aircraft was punctual in landing and departing.  Check-in was smooth enough.  The aircraft was old, with old seats. Although no complaints with them.    The food selections were already mentioned in the menu online.  It was a decent dish of rice and meat.   My flight was during the breakfast times.  The airline did not serve any alcohol.  This was a drawback.  I would expect no time constraints.   The in-flight service was friendly and attentive.  The bathroom had a lot more amenities like shaving blades, combs etc.   I enjoyed my experience.  The Airline did its job and was punctual with its timings.  The in-flight entertainment has the most selection of movies of any airline, I have flown.  There were different languages to choose from too.",positive
2678,Finest flight I’ve ever been on I heartily recommend Singapore Airlines to anyone going to the north of England or Scotland. A direct flight which bypasses the craziness that is London will get you To Manchester — a small convenient airport where you can easily take the train up to Scotland or rent a car and tour the north of England comfortably. The flight experience was amazing and has spoiled me for all future flights if they are not on Singapore!!,positive
9818,"Expected more from Singapore Air Funny how alot of people told me that Singapore Airlines was a great airline to fly with but I really did get this!! I am not a great flyer and do get nervous and do not prefer the back of plane. I was totally annoyed to find I was put in row 60 after advising staff of a forward seat, window or aisle or anywhere and the flight was not full. I was told I was sitting with my group (group booking) although we were all placed in different seats. The only bonus was the couple next to me moved to centre seats so I had a row of 3 to myself. The booking was group with meant I couldnt manage it online which is not usually the case with booking references unique to the traveller so couldnt request special meals or seat allocations. The service was fine, staff seemed friendly enough although check in was slow at Brisbane as there is no electronic booking. The meals were not grand as when you are at the back you have little to no choice in meals by the time they got to me so I didnt get to eat on the way over. Entertainment was very average, not much choice of decent or current movies and screens were hard to see, very low quality on the plane I had. Embarking and disembarking were fine but did feel the cleanliness was a bit below average. There was dried drink on my trays etc so felt a bit dirty. Same issue on the way home, except I had organise to have my seat changed and my ticket linked to a colleague to sit together but when we check in they had me in row 60, my colleague in row 58!! Not happy but they did change us to sit together on a full flight and up front. Only annoyance was it was a red eye flight and they still served dinner at near on midnight and we had to put our seats up so the people behind could eat there fish meal so we couldnt sleep. We had about 90 minutes of lights down before they woke us again for breakfast. Overall not my first choice for airline and think I will avoid flying again us necessary.",neutral

8897,"Dishonesty re changing flights OK 9 months out from my trip I needed to bring my flights forward by a day. According to the T&C on my booking I could do this for $70 fee. OK no worries. So I called them. Was told that there were no more seats in the class I paid for available and it would be an extra $1600 pp. more than the actual flight I paid for. So I said no. 
Did my homework, found there were seats in the class I paid for for the day before. So called them again, was told the exact same spiel as the day before and when I said I had the booking page up and there were seats at the same price/class I was told it was an ""old price"" not available any more. Obviously a lie. So I was fuming and got some information re trade practices. 
Called the next day and spoke to a guy this time who tried to feed me the same old lies but I was prepared this time and lo and behold he said that seats just became available on that flight I wanted to change to. I should not have had to work this hard to get what was right and fair. I have read others who have been through the same thing as this so be aware of this common lie and obvious money grab. It is disappointing that an airline such as this who prides itself on its integrity stoops this low and treats their customers like fools. 
However the flight itself was fine, the food was good and the service good,entertainment was not that great, however my experience in changing flights was what really made me upset and not enjoy the experience as I wish I could have.
So my advice is that if you want to change flights, arm yourself with all the information you can as well as laws and don't accept nothing except what you are entitled to based on their own T&C.  Next time I will go Royal Brunei business class for not much more in price but far more in value for money.",negative

7112,Watch your weight My wife and I recently flew to Stockholm on Singapore Airlines code share with SAS to celebrate Christmas and took along with a lot of presents for the family. In all our four bags weighed 96kg. We thought this was ok working on the normal SAS business class allowance of 2 x 32kg. However the leg Sydney to Singapore was under an SIA flight number rather than SAS and SIA has a weight allowance of just 40 kg each. This took some frantic repacking at the airport to squeeze under the limit. Incongruously coming back the other direction all the way to Sydney our bags could weigh 2 x 32kg under the flight rules.

Today my neighbor was a 75 year old born in Arkansas internment camp for Japanese in 1943, who returned to Japan to teach English before retiring.
Premium Economy includes gourmet meal choices for lunch and dinner(if selected online before boarding), complementary wine/champagne, and even Ben and Jerry's Cookie Dough ice cream. The beautifully dressed stewardesses twice provided hot towels, and multiple drink and snack selections throughout the flight. At other times the room was darkened for sleeping where many passengers utilized the noise cancelling head phones to utilize the large seat monitors for its huge selection of movies, TV, games and music. 
We walked back the 2 aisles to share the ample economy restrooms stocked with mouthwash, hand lotion and toothbrushes and toothpaste.
This was our best long term flight that we truly enjoyed rather than endured.",positive
7155,"Long trip - friendly crew Always dread a long flight and we have always found Singapore Airlines offer a good service. 
Staff are always so courteous. We are entertained by the in-flight service, catching up on favourite television shows and movies. 
Sometimes the food is to our liking or not (we tend to be fussy), but on this flight we enjoyed it all.
The toilets were close at hand and we were lucky and did not have to join a queue.
We prefer to pay the extra on flights rather than go with some of the cheaper airlines, though we would, of course, love to be upgraded one day!!!!!",positive
4707,"High expectation but not fulfilled. Our route were between Stockholm via Moscow to Singapore. The ticket was advised as direct flight but said to have a technical stop in Moscow. 
I turned out to be a full transfer through security and rather long wait at a very depressed airport in Moscow. 

As airline I can only compare to other such as, Thai air, Qatar, Emirates and SAS when coming to long distance flights. 
Singapore is  not bad at all, but compare to what you pay Qatar has been most affordable. Qatar, Singapore and Emirates are all good airlines, but for me Qatar has impressed me the most. 
Though I must say, that Singapore Airlines has the most professional cabin crew I've met. They are almost perfect from outer appearance to being accomodative friendly. 
But the aircraft itself did not impress! 
The toilets were not very fresh and badly cleaned between the routes.  And they were super small so you had hard time turning around.  
The food (at least at the economy class) was terrible, with dry and crumbly bread and tasteless food. The other airlines I mentioned earlier had all better food and drinks. 
The seats were narrow and the only good thing about them were the adjustable food rests that I missed on the other airline's air crafts. 
But for what we paid compare to what we could get from the other airlines, I must say that I'm disapointed with Singapore. 
Going back to Singapore again, I'll rather take other airlines next time.",neutral

1970,"A little bit of luxury Having to sit in economy for 14 hours is not fun. We have flown this leg of our journey before, in both economy and premium economy. If there is any chance you can pay that bit extra for the premium economy then do it! It makes that long flight just a bit more bearable. 
We sat at the front in this section... so much more leg room.  It was worth paying the extra just for this. 
We have always had good food and service from the cabin crew. With the food and flying premium economy, we were able to order our food before flying (that way you’re guaranteed to get what you want and not what is left.)
Headphones are better too. 
We have always flown to Oz with Singapore airlines, wouldn’t think of flying with any other airline.",positive
2753,"Never again  Very disappointed with their service. Very rude FA’s to start (on my return) . Bad energy overall. Horrible food, the worst I have ever experienced on any airline.

9947,"Good in flight facilities with friendly service I seldom fly with Singapore airlines but this time I choose it for the lower ticket price. To my surprise, all flight attendants are beautiful girls or handsome guys, they always smile and are willing to help. Besides, there are many tv programs and the space of the seat is enough for feet sketching. Inside the toilet, there are different stuff for usage, eg napkins, toothbrush, lotion, etc.",positive
4112,"Excellent once again I have been lucky to fly with Singapore airlines on several occasions.
I have also flown with other big name airlines to similar destinations and quite simply Singapore is easily the best.
This flight 13 hours from the UK to Singapore was unfortunately delayed about 3 hours. We were given a £15 voucher to spend in the departure lounge during our delay. Not great I know but last year we’re suffered the same fate with a different big name airline but received nothing.
The flight itself was as always great. Good food, snacks in between, and good service from the cabin crew. The toilets must have been regular restocked and cleaned as they were of a high standard throughout the long flight.
The Economy seats are good with a decent amount of room with plenty of pillows and blankets provided.
The entertainment system in the seat back in front of you is good with a large selection of films, tv shows, games and music.
The only negative I have is that I am still waiting to hear from Singapore airlines about my claim for compensation around the delay as I missed my connection meaning I was significantly delayed to my final destination. Under the EU laws this claim should be straight forward but Singapore seem to be dragging their feet a little.
Regardless of this issue I would always travel on Singapore if possible.",positive

In addition, when turning the seat into a flat bed, my feet had to be turned to the right in order to get into the «tunnel» to get enough space. On most other airlines, the design allows the passengers to stretch your legs straight forward.",neutral
8065,"This version is dated.. but it still delivers in every single way! Over the past few years I’ve flown with a lot of different airlines’s business classes, and I’ve learnt that the key to providing an amazing onboard service is getting a good grasp on all the elements, rather than doing really well with one and letting the others suffer. 

As we all know, there is no such thing as perfection.. especially when it comes to airlines, and there are always flaws but I’m reasonably confident in  the statement that Singapore Air is one of the best and covers all the relevant bases pretty damn well. 

As I said, no airline is perfect and Singapore airways is no exception. There are definitely things that I would change but on the whole they are one of my preferred airlines to travel with.  I’ve flown with Singapore a few times, but this particular review is of their old version business class on their A380-800. For those of you who aren’t plane geeks, the A380 is the double decker giant of their fleet, with downstairs holding 333 economy & 38 premium economy seats and the upper deck holding  60 business & 12 first class seats. You might be lucky to still get a version of the A380 with the old business class but if you do them your in for a treat.. savour the moment as this won’t be around for much longer!  

Although lacking an onboard bar, SQ's superjumbo’s old Business class is home to some of the widest business class seats to grace our skies. In fact the Singapore air old business class seat puts most airlines’ first class products to shame, it really is a positively enormous seat!  

Anyway before I get into it, heres some basic useful info for check in that might be useful if you decide to travel Singapore business: 
* Frequent flyer program: KrisFlyer, Star Alliance.
* Priority check-in: Keep a look out for the blue carpet and 'business class' signage at the check-in hall.
* Checked baggage allowance: 40kg, raised to 60kg for Star Alliance Gold, KrisFlyer Gold and Velocity Platinum; and 80kg for all PPS Club tiers.
* Carry-on baggage allowance: 2x115cm bags at up to 7kg each, plus one additional item such as a laptop satchel or duty-free goods.
* Priority security screening: Most airports will accommodate a priority screening lane.
* Priority boarding privileges: Business class was called to board with Suites Class (first), and airline members prior to opening the economy passengers.

  On this particular journey I was travelling back from Singapore to London Heathrow. On the way out I had sampled the New business class on a different aircraft which ill review another day! 
If you’ve ever been to Singapore you’ll know that Changi airport is one of the best in the world, its beautiful and offers endless entertainment for its guests including its own cinema, butterfly garden, and even a fully kitted out 5* Crowne Plaza hotel inside the airport.
 But for me, it was straight to the lounge to enjoy the benefits of some of the money id just spent.. 
With showers, Charles Heidsieck Champagne at any hour and calming instrumental music playing in the background, it's a great place to both relax and be productive. This particular lounge in terminal 3 is also entirely separate to the adjacent KrisFlyer Gold lounge used by frequent flyers travelling in economy, but can also be accessed by airline members flying with SQ in any class of service.
You'll also find a SilverKris business class lounge in Terminal 2 should your flight depart from there, although SQ's flights to Australia and Europe all use T3. I highly recommend taking advantage of the lounge if you have time as its a great way to have a much needed refresh before a Long flight, especially if you’re on a stopover.

After having a quick shower and freshen up and also making the most of the alcoholic beverages in the lounge, it was now time to board the plane. As I said before, SQ waste no time getting the premium passengers onboard so there is minimal waiting around.
 As soon as you’re on board you’re greeted with a smile by one of the singapore air staff who are renowned for having some of the best hospitality of any other airline. Once my ticket was checked I was guided to my seat, where I was seated for all of 30 seconds before someone brought me a glass of champagne and a hot towel. A really nice touch by SQ, and one now adopted by other airlines is that the crew have your name memorised from the manifest and for the whole flight you’ll be addressed as ‘Mr Mitchell’.. or whatever. Singapore even go there extra mile and if you’re with their loyalty programme and they have your previous flights on record, they’ll even have noted small details from your previous flights such as you having a coffee before landing for example, and just like Magic they’ll come round and offer you a coffee just before landing. It really is the nice touches like that which I love about Singapore air.

  Anyway, lets talk about the seat, as thats where you’ll be spending the next 12 hours.. Singapore Airlines old A380 boasts one of the widest business class seats in the industry, measuring a whopping 30 inches when upright.. I’m a big guy and you could’ve fit 2 of me in this huge armchair (a squeeze but still doable) it really is crazy big.
 just to do a quick comparison, emirates’ a380 business class seats are a mere 18.5 inches wide, while Etihad's business seats are at 20 inches.. a massive difference.
 However after flipping the seat into bed mode this huge width does become somewhat limited. If youve flown Singapore business before you’ll know they don’t use any conventional seat design, its unlike any other, and with these you aren’t able to turn your seat into a bed by just clocking a button. Actually its a matter of getting up and folding the back of your seat over to make it a bed. I always thought this was a bit of a bad feature and a bit of a ’steam method’ compared to other airlines but hey ho. Once this is done because of the seat configuration you have to sleep kind of diagonally so your feet slot into the space in front of the seat in front of you. Its a strange design but I’ve had it before and its not uncomfortable and still offers good space.   A little tip, get the bulkhead seats as they don’t have this problem and you’re able to practically starfish in bed!
I got the bulkhead on this flight, and even with me being 6Ft1 tall I had plenty of space and it was so bloody comfortable!
I was able to get a good 7 hours sleep on the overnight journey home to London.You can also signal that you don't wish to be disturbed from your bed If you don’t want to be woken up for meals.
When I did wake up a handy cover in front flips open to reveal a mirror so I could inspect how mental I looked after my nap.
Also tucked away are two USB power ports and a multi-country outlet so you can keep your tech juiced!
 The seats were great as far as size and comfort goes, but regrettably they were starting to show their age after debuting in 2007.
 the controls and remote were all proper old school and the buttons were mostly worn down. But you know what is just aesthetics and I can forgive them for that.  

Now I don’t remember a great deal of the taste of the food on this flight because, big shock, I was trashed.. ironically I’m not actually a great flyer and I tend to get a bit heavy on the champers when I’ve got a Long flight.. its basically tradition now and its not going to change! 
while were on the subject of champagne.. champagne lovers will also take comfort in the 2007 Taittinger Brut Millésimé.. an impressive choice when most other airlines typically reserve vintage bubbles for first class passengers. 
As for food, I know SQ offer An extensive delectables menu to fill the gaps in between meals, with 13 snack choices including noodles and sandwiches and that kind of thing which I took advantage of after breakfast.
Later in the flight lunch was served.. I had the chicken and mutton satay sticks with onion, cucumber and peanut sauce which was pretty damn good.
I also ordered a goose liver foie gras which again I really enjoyed.
For my main course I was presented with a staggering amount dishes to choose from.. there was literally like 50 choices, which lets be honest is absolute madness.. but pretty damn impressive. After taking my time reading the menu, I opted for SQ's classic lobster Thermidor. Sautéed in butter, flambéed in brandy, sprinkled with cheese and served with creamy mushroom sauce, garlic and spicy mustard, buttered asparagus and yellow rice.. it was mouth watering and beautiful.. it's again something I’d expect to find only in first class.. but it's still  a real treat for business class passengers.

  For the people like me who enjoy using a long haul flight to catch up on movies, lets just talk about their entertainment systems.. KrisWorld, SQ’s inflight entertainment system, delivers a great variety of movies and TV shows on a 15.4-inch seatback LCD screen, or you can also connect your iPhone/iPod via the data ports or something more conventional such as a portable DVD player using standard TV RCA connectors. There was a good selection on my flight and I didn’t even have enough time to watch everything that I wanted!
SQ provide Noise-cancelling headphones which do the job perfectly.. although a little uncomfortable on your ears after a few hours they’re a welcome necessity.
They offer wifi onboard at extra charge but I wouldn’t use it unless I really had to as its pretty useless at the best of times and pricey for what you get. 

Service on this flight was totally exemplary, whats great is that because of the small segregated sections of the upper deck you'll generally always be served by the same two or three crew members, who in this case took no more than 30 seconds to answer call bells and were so attentive that often two flight attendants would arrive simultaneously to offer assistance. I expect nothing less from Singapore air and this is of course where they get their ‘best of the best’ reputation from.   
As I said at the beginning, a great in flight service counts on a good balance of all the elements required. Singapore air time after time delivers on this with a consistently above average service on all counts (with most elements being nothing short of excellent). The service, entertainment, food, and all the little touches are top notch and you really are extremely well looked after throughout the entire flight. 
Yeah, sure this versions’s seats were a little dated. But you know what? I actually prefer this, if you can get past the aesthetics and concentrate on the comfort then its actually a much more pleasant hard product than some of its more modern versions.  The of course, the Singapore a380 also lacks an onboard bar which many of its competitors now offer, but to be honest I always see the bars as more of an unused novelty. I’ve often popped to the bar on a flight for a picture but rarely for anything else. When I can get drinks delivered to my seat at the push of a button I’m not sure why everyone gets so excited about getting up to have a drink at the bar? So its no biggie for me and I wont mark it down for that.

  Overall, Singapore air is hands down my favourite airline to fly with. Their hard product is always amazing (old or new) for space and comfort, and its also unique in the sense that no other airline has the same as them.. meaning its a totally unique experience. But even as far as their soft product, customer support, in-airport care, lounges, loyalty programmes, onboard service, hospitality, in flight entertainment and food.. they excel in all of them and give all other airlines a good run for their money! Even being on an older plane does not mean you get worse service.. their amazing service is provided throughout their fleet. The only thing they don’t offer which some of their competitors do is airport chauffeurs for premium customers.. which is something they should look into as its a great seeing point and a nice touch.

 Of course, all these luxuries do come at a price, SQ is one of the most expensive airlines for premium seats but they justify it with the product that they offer.. if money is no object then of course opt for Singapore air as they really are second to none in my books!",positive
3410,"Astounding. Literally astounding. There literally aren't sufficient words to sum up how pleasant this flight was. This is the standard to which other airlines should aspire. Mesmerisingly elegant crew, fantastic food, great entertainment and unbelievable service.

2380,"No birthday cake on my birthday onboard SQ flight I was excited to fly out of Singapore on my birthday for the first time. I had heard of passengers given birthday surprises onboard the plane and I was anticipating if I will have one since I am flying SIA. Well, as in the title of my review...I received none, not even a birthday greeting from any crew onboard. Guess I think too much and too highly of myself (probably I am sitting in the economy class). Apart from the boo-boo, everything are nice and well thru out the flight both ways (departure and arrival). The new plane 787 was good, big screen for entertainment.",positive
3244,Best Service By Far Singapore staff are truly amazing. Service and food is the best.

The 777 aircraft flown are the largest passenger jets currently flying into Wellington.

There was good leg space.

This is a disgrace especially when you pay a premium price and have to be crowded in like sardines. Normally fly premium economy or business and had no idea things were this bad in economy. Seems like the Boeing 777 had more space in economy.

When we arrived L.A. at around 9:30 in the evening, we found out that 1 of our checked-in luggage was missing.  Accompanied by my L.A. based sister-in-law, we went to file an irregularity report in LAX because none from the Singapore airlines was around that late evening.  Honestly, it was such a disappointing feeling for a tourist to miss a luggage and not being able to speak personally with personnel from the airlines.  And upon arriving the place where we staying in California, I found out we had another issue with Singapore airlines.  One of my luggage got badly damaged and that it was impossible to be fixed.  We had to throw it away as it was useless already.  Since the luggage that had all of my clothing as well as most of my husband’s, we had to buy everything we needed especially that our tour includes places with different weather conditions.  We were to go to Temecula, where the heat wave was really mean.  And had to go to Oakley and San Francisco where the weather was cold especially for us, who are used to the tropical weather.  
At first, I was very much disappointed with Singapore airlines because there was no way for me to contact them from L.A.  I had to get help from a cousin who lives in Singapore to contact them.  I also got help from my brother-in-law, James, who works at LAX.  He found a way to relay my concern to SAL and to connect me with the said airlines.  It took several days for the airlines to locate my lost luggage, which was eventually found in Singapore.  I learned from my cousin that my lost luggage never got on board the flight I was in.  To cut the long story short, my lost luggage was delivered to my sister-in-law’s residence sometime on the 23rd day since our arrival.  Prior to that, I have been communicating with Leo of Singapore airlines.  He was the person who ensured that I get my luggage back, as well as, be compensated well for my damaged luggage.  Aside from my luggage returned and delivered to me, he promised me an extra check-in luggage with a weight of 32 kilos to be free of charged and that the airlines was going to compensate for my lost luggage and damaged suitcase when we fly back home.  
I was flying back home on Oct. 10, 2022 via SQ 037 with my 3 children and we had free check-in luggage of 23kilos times 2 each passenger PLUS the bonus of 32 kilos that Leo promised me.  However, my to-be-checked in luggage reached 10 and all 10 exceeded the required 23 kilos weight.  So, I tried to pre-purchase extra baggage via online but failed.  I’ve contacted the same contact number I was using to contact Leo but then he was unavailable.  It was another guy who took the call.  I just forgot his name but he sounded Indian and I’d like to mention that he was quite unhelpful.  I am definitely not being racist but I wanted to share that I was one unhappy customer with how he communicated with me.  He doubted that I couldn’t purchase extra baggage online.  He thought that I was doing it the wrong way so I had to send him screenshots to prove to him that it was impossible.  Anyway, he only told me to take screenshots and if I could prove that it was impossible even though I was doing it correctly, then he would give me the discount for excess baggage.  But clearly, he doubted that I was doing it right.  He probably thought I was that incapable of using their website.  When I arrived the Singapore Airlines counter (in the airport) before my flight to check in, I was politely greeted by a guy named Brennon ( I hope I got the name right). When I told him that I was supposed to meet Leo, he asked me if I was “me” (he mentioned my complete name).  And then he smiled upon my approval, and mentioned that we spoke on the phone.  Just to clarify, Brennon is not the same guy I was speaking to regarding the excess baggage.  I actually saw the (Indian) guy in the other counter.  (If I remember it right, his name was Nash.)  Anyway, Brennon introduced me to the guy behind him in a suit and it was Leo.  I was super glad to see the smiling face of Leo.  A lady, whom I presume is a co-worker, handed me the cash settlement (for the lost baggage and damaged suitcase) and Release and Indemnity form that I needed to sign.  Leo made up for the hassles I’ve gone through BIG TIME.  He checked in all my 10 luggage at no extra cost.  (Remember, everything was over 23kilos each!), gave us (the whole family) free access to the Star Alliance Lounge, boarded with the business class (It’s always convenient to board ahead of the rest so you get to put your hand carried items on the cabin above you), seats in the forward seat zone for all 4 of us, and 3 of us were in the extra leg room seats (it was like seating in the Premium Economy or even better.  I only booked on economy class, just so you know).  And all these were for FREE!  I could not thank Leo enough for making up for everything.  When we were entering the boarding area, I could not help but be teary eyed for all the blessings that the Lord has bestowed upon me and my family.  It was a trip worth remembering!  We are all so glad to have flown via Singapore airlines.  Would love to travel again with them this year.  God bless Singapore Airlines!
P.S.  The amount I received from the settlement?  It was an amount that I would always be grateful for.  😊",positive
6824,"Good one way; average on the way back We were in premium economy.  From SYD to SIN, a day flight, the service was good, the food good and very generous.  It was comfortable throughout. Staff were lovely.
On the way home (a night flight) the aircraft was bigger so a slightly smoother flight.The seats not very comfortable - I couldn't rest my head on anything - the window nor the head rest (JAL's PE seats for example can wrap around your head somewhat).  It was also difficult to get out of the seat when the passengers in front had their seats fully reclined.  This is surprising in premium economy.  Economy looked quite squashed too. 
 The food was not good at all (yuk) and such a surprise given how good the flight SYD to SIN was.
Toilets for PE are way down the back of the plan.  I'd probably go with another carrier if possible.
Inflight entertainment was good but on the flight home, it wasn't touch screen which is annoying (oh, I'm spoilt).",neutral
7846,"I wonder how brilliant First Class can be  The hostesses were the nicest, most welcoming people and you could see they actually cared about you. The entertainment was very up to date, the seats were super comfy and clean. The bathroom was clean with luxurious toiletries. 

I had restaurant worthy food for the 1st time inflight and everything on my plate tasted really fresh. To crown it all they served beautiful ice cream on the way to and an ice cream sandwich on the way from the Philippines. 

From the point we checked in to the point we got off the airport, we felt like royalty. This is truly the best airline in the world. Flying economy and getting such amazing treatment,  I am going to save up and upgrade to Business class on my next flight and be literally on top of the world.",positive
2422,"Long trip home Very professional airline.  On time and smooth service (announcements, food, etc).  However, this is my second trip with this airline where I felt that the air hostesses were giving us the economy service.  On a 10 hour flight, surely you don't have to rush me with my food and drinks?  A few times I was also asked why I had called for service (in a slightly rushed manner) when the call was from someone two seats down the row.  Just felt ""economical"" with their ""friendly"" service.  On board entertainment is super with lots of options of movies/TV/books/games.  Kids were kept entertained.  Good flight and well managed.",positive

This is a big joke and damn near impossible to do with RUDE passengers in front of you WHO just push the button and their seat back as far as they can without even asking if it's ok to do it. Comfort for other passengers with legs should be considered.

The flight took off at 12:45 this we booked business class seats so we could enjoy the lounge, have a shower etc....we were very disappointed. Everyone speaks about Changi bring awesome.., the lounges are not. They are under staffed, overfilled & the bathrooms were not up to Singapore standard in business class. We started at the terminal 3 lounge & because it was so busy thought we would try terminal 2...it was worse. There is not enough comfortable seating or quiet areas.",positive

266,"Do not fly Singapore Airlines  Definitely not the best airline and I wouldn't consider it to be anywhere in the top class.

Absolutely the worst experience one could imagine. Toilets were disgusting and dirty. Staff were unpleasant and not very friendly. Seating is basically on top of each other so you can't eat. I would highly recommend you utilize another airline for the amount of money you pay.",negative
8917,"Premium Economy  Poor Service We travelled last week for the first time with this airline.  We had heard good reports but our service was very poor quality. The price of the upgrade was over £600 each.  We have travelled in Premium Economy many times with Virgin and TUI.  They both leave  
 Singapore way  behind.  There was no pre take off drink.  There was  one drink before lunch and one drink with lunch. And no refills. The flight attendants seemed all to have had their personality surgically removed. Maybe we just had a terrible rooky crew of flight attendants but this kind of poor quality service on a 12 hour flight was not worth the extra cost.  Goodbye Singapore Airlines.",neutral

8220,"Pleasant journey Travelled in the first week of November in Singapore Airlines. The aircraft was an A330-300.

Previously, I had travelled 12 years ago with Singapore Airlines, and personally, their great service levels have remained what they were years ago - serving hot towels in economy class may be considered a thing of past, but not by Singapore Airlines.  It's a great way to start a journey.

Check-in process at AMD was smooth and quick, the same goes for the security check and immigration. Boarding was on time and efficient as well. Firstly, the boarding call is announced for business class passengers and then for the SilverKris and Star Alliance members, and finally, for the economy class, in the following sequence: group 4, 5, and 6.

Cabin crew was smiling and enthusiastic and customer friendly. The meal served on board was tasty, adequate in quantity and well-cooked. Lights were dimmed so that passengers could catch some sleep while on board. An Amenity Kit, comprising a pair of socks and a dental kit was given to all passengers.

Landing was smooth and before time (flight arrived 30 mins earlier than schedule). Great experience!",positive
3738,"Never Flying Again!!  Our story is a very long and complicated one! For those who are interested please read on, for those who want the short version: I am never flying SingaporeAir again thanks to their total lack of customer service and terrible ability to follow up on issues regarding refunds and changes to flights!! 

Here we go: I was booking flights for my husband and I flying from Darwin Aus to London UK but when we landed in the UK we were going to the passport office to get his passport updated which would mean his name would change. I called SingaporeAir to confirm if I booked return flights that I could change his name on the way home. They said yes that would be fine as long as you had copies of the old and new passport. So I booked us both return flights!l for our first international holiday together!! 
On arriving in the UK we got the passport updated and sent through to SingaporeAir straight away to which I got the response, “No we can’t make any changes as it is against SingaporeAir policy” and that I would have to cancel his part of the return flight and re-book him a new flight home. 

After calling them for 3 days I finally got through to someone who could actually help me (all while on Holidays and not being able to relax and enjoy ourselves) they finally canceled his return flight and re-booked under the new name. 

I was then told to expect a call back from the refund team in the next 48/72hrs. This was on the 20th of August 2019. We are now at the 10th of September and after 6 phone calls and 3 emails I still have not received this phone call. Each time I do contact them I get the same response! “It has been escalated to the department responsible and to expect a call in the next 48/72 hours”... I thought that meant 2-3 days not 2-3 weeks.

Now, for those wondering, when I booked the flights originally I did buy the more expensive tickets that said they allowed changes for a fee so we could make the necessary changes and pay the fee but still have a seat secured for him to fly home. Nowhere in their terms and conditions does it say they cannot change a name (same person new name). But apparently this was against company policy. Oh and lets not forget I was now out of pocket!! I paid something along the lines of $1,800 for return flights but had to pay $1,700 for a ONE WAY FLIGHT!!!!! For a seat he already had but under the wrong name now.... 

Each time I call I also ask to speak to their supervisor and have always gotten the same response. “Our supervisors are not trained in this matter and will only be able to tell you what I already have”. I always say thats fine I just want to speak to someone with authority and then they say “let me see if I can find someone” and proceed to put me on hold for an indefinite time hoping I will go away. I have waited 20min once!! All on my phone bill. 

I am lost with what to do now, I am out of pocket, could not enjoy my first international trip with my Husband and now will never fly SingaporeAir again because this is getting beyond ridiculous! 

Crazy thing, the flight itself was great! Friendly staff, good food and clean plane! Just TERRIBLE SERVICE from their administrative team. So because of that I am NEVER flying SingaporeAir again. 

NOT HAPPY!",negative
8544,"Cabin and entertainment system in need of a bad refresh I am really surprised how old the cabin is ... it is the same one that I flew more than a decade ago.  While Singapore projects an image of a up-mart airline that is modern and progressive, my experience tells the reverse.  Just before joining the flight, I was on Air New Zealand and their cabin & entertainment system - hardware, software and content  is so many times better than SQ.  There is a big gap between their advertised image and reality -- maybe it is profits that has pushed back upgrading their planes.  WHAT IS HAPPENING TO SQ? A great airline feels like it is cutting too many corners.  To be fair, the service by the crew on board remains exceptional.",neutral

5832,"Traumatic Rescheduling Experience Recently I booked a ticket from Brisbane to Bangalore, however due to Visa delays I had to reschedule the dates. One of my Sigapore airlines ticket was rescheduled at a nominal fee, which was done through makemytrip. But I have faced a very traumatic experience rescheduling the one with goibibo.
I bought the ticket for 38k INR. The rescheduling fee on goibibo website shows 3.5k INR plus the fair difference.
Now here comes the funny part.
I checked the prices of the ticket before calling and rescheduling and the flights were cheaper, around 35k INR on my preferred date.
So when I called them the estimate first time given to me was 25,500 INR. The breakdown was 14K INR rescheduling fee and 11K INR fair difference. 
I will never know how rescheduling fee got there, neither will I know how the fair difference came in picture.
When I called goibibo for the same, I was told that Singapore airlines can adjust the fee(apparently to whatever they want).
And when I asked about the fair difference they said, that they cannot book me in the fresh ticket which costs lesser than my ticket, they will book me in some another ticket for which the fair difference exists apparently.
Now the next day apparently when I got a call back from goibibo for rescheduling, they are quoting the charges above 1,00,000 INR. Can you believe it?
The ticket still costs 35k INR. But if I have to reschedule it, it will cost that much.
Here they are practically forcing me to cancel my non refundable ticket. And making me buy a fresher one.
So much for the facility of rescheduling?
I am attaching the picture of the cost of available ticket on the date I want it rescheduled. Now you decide what is fair? Or maybe learn that how one can loot from another getting a superior position. Do learn from my mistake and do not book such dicey tickets.",negative
274,"Two excellent flights this time! My previous experience three weeks earlier was a little bit disappointing (BOM-SIN-BKK), however, there were two excellent flights this time: SQ707 BKK-SIN on 26 July and SIN-BOM 31 July. The crew on the SQ707 on 26 July were  exceptional (IFM Geradine, LSS Jane, FSS Gift, FSS Moon & FS Arif), wanted to get their names since great and dedicated work must be recognized.

As already said, superb crews on both flights, excellent lunch/dinner, and flights on-time. The only gripe is that I don't seem to get a comfortable position on the B777-300ER: the angled position is quite awkward and my back hurts after two hours - prefer the A350 over the B777-300ER. This, of course, is a matter of personal taste only.",positive
595,"One of the best private business class seats in the sky today I had high expectations, but I was not disappointed. Incredible crew, thank you Rebecca and Juanita taking care of me so well. The seat is 30 inches wide (10 more than most) and you have a side table that is at the right height with several storage compartments. The seat side wall does reduce the visibility out the window somewhat, but this was not a big negative. The seat was very comfortable as long as I found the right sitting position or it it could have felt hard. For sleeping you do need to angel yourself as your feet will go in to the footwell on one side of the seat in front of you.

5868,"Travelling with a wedding dress & honeymoon treat Top tip for flying with your wedding dress:  Before flying to NZ from the UK, I tried many times to get a clear answer from Singapore Airlines about the best way to take my dress on board (obviously not going to put it in my checked luggage!), with all answers being vague and with no guarantee that dresses can be hung in the cabin. In the end I bought a special wedding dress box which fit Singapore's carry-on dimensions (must be 115cm or less in total), but the total weight of the box + dress was over the 7kg limit. So I ended up carefully stuffing my dress into a small carry-on sized suitcase and it was just fine. Wrapped in tissue paper and plastic, there weren't even many wrinkles when I opened it. 
Another top tip: if you're on your honeymoon, let your travel agent know and you may get a lovely treat like we did! A couple of Singapore Slings and some chocolate cake were a lovely way to end our very long flight back to the UK.",positive

7244,"Long, dark and depressing flight Having flown in business class on the outbound trip, we returned but used Premium Economy. Seats were generally ok as was the general service. As we left Singapore at 2.30am it meant we were flying mostly at night. The flight was about 14 hours long, which we knew and had prepared for. What we did not prepare for was the depressing feeling of the flight as the cabin was ‘dark’ for 12 of those hours. I do not understand why, after 8 hours of fight, the cabin could not be illuminated. Yes, I know you have your own reading lights but it’s not the same.

As our anxieties increased a more senior staff member returned after about 10 minutes. As he described the overbooking situation, we were told that it was either going to be us or a woman with 2 children who would miss the flight. This was despite there being 260 other passengers on the flight and us being 4.5 hours early. I was travelling with my wife and 83 year old mother in law and had specifically chosen this direct flight home to avoid transfers and delays for her, given her advanced age. I believe that we were placed under unfair pressure and deliberately made to feel guilty if we decided to displace the woman and her children (if she even existed) - we were encouraged to feel this was our problem and our decision rather than the airline’s issue. Overbooking obviously is an airline strategy to maximise profits - selling more tickets than you have seats. Just be honest about it and don’t put pressure on people! This experience left us with a bad feeling at the end of our holiday - this is not good customer service!!

The onboard experience was ok although the legroom was cramped (I’m 175cm tall) and sleeping on the night flight was uncomfortable. Definitely better to fly during waking hours. Singapore Airlines is often mentioned as having great customer service however I think our experience was only average regarding onboard service. The cabin crew on the outbound flight were observed to be a bit sharp and impatient with some other passengers. As previously described the check in service was very poor indeed.

Unfortunately I can’t provide a positive recommendation for this airline.",negative
7020,"Very good flight as always!!! Great flight connecting in Singapore. 
Food fantastic with a great menu handed out on take-off. This is the reason for travelling with Singapore airlines as even in economy the small things are taken care of. 
Staff very helpful at all times
Airbus a380 is outstanding and another reason we choose Singapore airlines!! Very comfy + roomy. These planes are much better than the others including the new dreamliner which is small and uncomfortable in comparison.",positive
3339,Great Experience Self check-in so easy and quick. Cabin crew were so friendly and helpful. There was plenty to eat and drink and a good choice. A vast range of things to watch or listen to. Will definitely fly with them again,positive
9944,"Vintage fleet The standard legroom is average, too small for me, 6'3"", so I'm forced to pay for a seat big enough for a tall westerner.  This means I sit alongside the bassinet seats with the screaming babies, will receive service last, am unlikely to have a meal choice, or time for a second drink, and I can't check in online, or through the machine as they have to see that I'm physically able, so I have to que up to check-in, and yes, I have to pay extra for all this when flying SQ.

On this particular trip, the USB port on my seat didn't work, so I couldn't charge my noise-cancelling headset to drown out the screaming babies, and the in-flight entertainment system is so old that when I missed some dialog through the SQ earpiece (no noise-cancellation technology here) then tried to rewind a couple of seconds, it jumped back 8 minutes, so I had to sit through all that again.  It's first generation, I've not seen these for some years now.  The attendant offered a change of seat, but having paid extra for the babies and legroom, that seemed somewhat unappealing.

They also have no air control at the seat, they just hope that all 200 passengers want exactly the same temperature, somewhat ambitious during boarding, where many are hot from the process, and the cabin seems hotter.  The attendant told me that the cabin is set for the ""ideal cabin temperature"", and I remain unsure how this was intended to solve the problem.

On the positive side, it was clean, and we didn't crash, which was great, but in the 21st century, we expect a little better than SQ currently provide, especially when they financially discriminate against tall people.",neutral
8251,Foods are plentiful I took the direct flight from SF to Singapore. We took off around 11am local time and arrived in Singapore 7pm local time as well. So I think it was around 16 hours. I know it sounds a Long flight but I did not feel so. The business class seat has a big enough space. I spent my times reading couple of newspapers and magazines. Continuing my readings on my kindle. And watched couple of latest films as well. I slept around 6 hours during the whole flight. The bed was nice. But I do not like how it is slanted. The flight attendants are also friendly but professional. The foods are amazing. Sometimes I felt they are a bit too much. Between the first meal and the second meal there are quite a big gap in term of timing but you can always ask for a nice warm noodle to the flight attendant. I would not take the business class if it was a personal trip though. It can cost you up to 4 times of the economic class. I know it is cozy and all but it does not really worth it.,positive
8731,"Painless Travel I had a cycle accident breaking elbow and hand, loosing front teeth, upper lip severely cut and face grazed from contact with road surface and after emergency treatment decided to return home to have elbow/arm reconstruction surgery.

Sadly I had to purchase new flight ticket but as always had travel insurance.

Singapore Airlines staff from moment of arrival at booking counter at Munich right up to baggage collection in Brisbane were exceptionally helpfull. As were the passengers seated next to me on each sector.

Whilst I declined the multiple offers staff at each airport viz Munich Changi Brisbane offered to provide transport and assistance with my carryon luggage.

8406,"Everything so good except! We opted for Singapore Airlines for our trip to Japan. We booked our tickets online. Smooth experience. A couple of days before the departure, we got an intimation for Internet Boarding. We did that. Being vegetarians, we wanted to make sure that we get the right food. The website took us to a page where we could register our requests. We did that diligently.

Smooth check in and boarding. Great! On board, I asked the stewardess about our special meal booking. Apparently they had none. But she asked us not to worry, as they had adequate vegetarian meals available. And it was good.

Our problem started in the Singapore Tokyo Sector. There they hardly had vegetarian options. They too didn’t have any special meal request. It was a long flight, and all we had was some salad and breads. This is where our experience got a big jolt. The stewardess was apologetic, but it wasn’t her fault.

The airline has to improve it’s website.",positive

The flight out of Brisbane was on time. We didn't have reserved seats and were given 67J&K and we didn't have anyone else in our 3 seat row so we spread out which was nice. The service by the crew is always professional. They served the meal then the lights were dimmed. They constantly bring water and refreshments around so we kept our fluids up and didn't get dehydrated. The Kris inflight entertainment system is great with heaps to chose from. They have some of the latest movies out so it was nice to watch them. It was only a 7hr flight so nice and short for the 1st hop. The plane landed on time in Singapore to a warm barmy night.

4544,Great service Though the flight lasted only a few hours; Singapore Airlines lived up to its reputation. Flight attendants were very attentive and almost always referred to passengers by their names. Food and beverage were excellent. Choice of meal requested was provided. The plane was very clean. Flight was on time. Business class seats were very comfortable. Having flown business class on many airlines; one notices that staff is more attentive to passengers but what I appreciated the most and found most unique was the array of choice in terms of music and movies in their entertainment system - truly amazing - have never experienced such a vast selection. I would fly with them again just for that reason,positive
8852,"Singapore Airline surely one of the best in the world, but recently didn't feel the warmth from their attendance as much as used to and others start to invade their friendliness with competing prices as well.  still best connection to other countries in the region and their airport is one of the best, if not the best, in the world, so if you have long connection book their in the airport hotel and enjoy really nice but if you have a longer connection they will allow you to take tour of the city regardless if your nationality and in a moderate price surely worth it .",positive
4969,"just hope this Airline finds our Bags that Lufthansa Lost . having finally left Singapore for a final leg of our journey Home, when we arrived at Brisbane Airport and got through passport control , we were waiting at the carousel for our bags to head home , after watching the carousel for what was the 4th rotation I was beginning to think there was something wrong no bags had shown up . I then hear over a loud speaker my friends name and then mine , to go to baggage services and I then had my doubts confirmed by a member of staff that our bags had not left Frankfurt to make the connection to Singapore then Brisbane . I started to panic as I had medical stuff in the bag that I desperately needed and no matter how I tried to explain my situation . all I was told my bags would hopefully arrive the next day , I was told to make a complaint to the first Airline I was on Lufthansa , then Singapore , but no real comfort was ever given or I felt from any of the Airlines, it was a case of no bags made there connecting fights .

Maybe a bowl of tiny fruit.  8 hours later a small hot breakfast.  Worst catering for a long haul.  The seats are so cramped and when the person in from reclines it’s game over for any kind of comfort.   Crew lovely but working with a bad service.   A few safety concerns such as blankets left on floor around exit door during landing (trip hazard in evacuation).  Crew talking during take off and landing (should be focussing in their safety drills in case of sudden emergency).  Toilet doors not locked during take off and landing.  Also too many announcements which could have been all done at once instead of the constant interruption. Never again. Singapore have lost my vote.,negative

The staff made us feel comfortable and were so polite a friendly, the food was absolutely fine. There was plenty of content on the screens to keep us happy throughout the duration of the flight.

It wasn't, we spoke to someone again and we were assured we could sit together ?
We couldn't.

However,I received an email from Singapore Airlines on 20th of April 2020 to say my return flights were cancelled. Singapore Airlines had been extremely unhelpful to me, I was left stranded. No alternate flight was arranged nor any support or assistance provided by airline or travel agent. I had to buy a separate ticket from Qatar Airline in order to return home safely on 7th of May 2020!

Food was good and the meals were hot. I loved being able to choose my meal prior to the flight on book the cook program. I had Hianise chicken for breakfast and it was tasty.
I would have loved to have been able to lift the arm rest in the middle of the 2 seats for more sleeping room as i had no one next to me. I do understand why they are fixed to accommodate all the extra bits in PE. I have to admit I am not a great sleeper on a flight, but it was more comfortable to rest.

If I can will always fly Singapore Airlines.",positive
5528,Skip This Flight.  Service and Experience Is Trash They had very few items on the business class menu or snack items. If you asked for something the standard answer is that they ran out. I sat in 21k. I would not reccommend flying this airline. The service is slow and poor. If you want a drink they loudly repeat your order. The drink never comes or it comes 30 mins later. The mid flight meal service took 3 hours from start to finish. The toilets smelled and two of the toilets had a perpetual green light on although there was a passenger in the toilet. I was so happy to get off this plane. The seats are horrible. Not restful. Take Cathay and stop in HK. I wish someone else would take up this route,negative
6671,"You just can't fault them. For the first leg of journey we flew premium economy to Singapore. We booked economy but just before our journey we placed a bid to upgrade. You can get a really good deal by doing this. The assistant on check in was really friendly and helpful. He even found us better seats so we had extra leg room. The seats were very spacious and comfortable. The entertainment system was really good as well, the screen was a really good size. It was also really nice having an extra rest under your legs. The food was really good and you could ask for any snacks throughout the flight. The attendants were really helpful and attentive.

8088,"Cabin crew attitude My wife and me travelled from Auckland to Singapore on Singapore Airlines ( SQ 0286 ).
on 5th November 2018.It was a very pleasant flight even in economy class with the cabin crew attentive and friendly and service the promise of Singapore Airlines.
We returned after our Asia tour ( Singapore/Bangkok/Seam Ream Cambodia/Ho Chi Min City ( Saigon ) on Singapore Airlines (SQ0285) also in economy class. Our seat numbers were 61F and 61G which were at the rear of the aircraft.There was nothing wrong with the seats and were quite comfortable.
However the cabin crew for this section of the aircraft left a lot to be desired.Either this cabin crew were new or they were just not carrying out their duties with the high standards of Singapore Airlines.The aircraft was delayed on the runway because another aircraft had broken down in front of ours and we couldn't take off.There was cold air blowing on my wife's head and I stood up in front of my chair to see if I could shut off the flow of cold air.This male cabin crew sitting in his crew seat in front called loudly"" Sir please sit down"". I can understand him doing his duty but we were stationary for many minutes.I immediately sat down. A short time later a passenger stood up and started removing something from his hand luggage fro the overhead locker. Nothing was said to him.
At both supper and breakfast which were both unappetising I had to make a special request for salt and pepper. Is Singapore Airlines cutting cost on this basic items?
Overall the service was poor and substandard not with what Singapore Airlines prides itself.",positive

5561,"Don't use Paris as a stop - atrocious!! Having flown from Manchester to Perth with one stop in Singapore where the flights went well, on time with the high level of comfort, service, food and drink, hot towels, inflight entertainment etc. we decided on the return fight to stop at both Singapore and Paris. 

Although we checked in on-line for the outward flights, we couldn't do it for the return flights due to the Paris to Manchester section. It didn't cause a problem as we just checked our luggage all the way through at Perth although the boarding cards for the Paris to Manchester section had to be picked up at the Singapore Airlines desk in Singapore. Again not a problem.

The trouble started when we landed at Paris. We arrived slightly late and the turnaround time to the last flight (Flybe under Singapore Airlines) was very tight. To ensure we didn't miss the flight Singapore Airlines ensured we quickly went through personal security checking etc., and onto the bus to the correct terminal. We arrived and although Singapore Airlines had confirmation that we were ok to come through, the French in their usual fashion said ""Non"". It wasn't helped by the fact that no Flybe representative was contactable. The representatives persevered while we had bus tours around the airport. In the end we were allowed through onto our flight leaving 40 minutes late. There is always a sting in the tail where the French are concerned and it came when we tried to collect our luggage. Amazingly it was still in Paris.

Talking to other passengers who had flown into Paris with us, it appears this is not a unique case. Suggestion - avoid Paris and use Amsterdam or Dusseldorf.

No problems with Singapore Airlines but the French and Flybe are a different story,",positive

It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasn't asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didn't save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!).  It didn't help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a much better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me.

plenty of inflight movies etc to watch and although the headphones provided were an in-ear bid style, you can use the adapter plug provided to use your own! They provided snacks and drinks throughout flight, and you can request larger snacks (wraps etc) if you wish. Singapore Slings are their speciality but I found these quite sweet! The only negative we had, was that there was an error with our meal choice on the way to Houston, Texas and despite raising this with the air hostess, they refused to amend this, meaning my father was stuck with the vegetarian meals which he didn’t eat. This obviously left him hungry. We did manage to amend this on the flight home both through the check-in staff and air hostess. I would recommend this airline to friends and family!",positive
3768,"Scheduled Flight UK to Auckland Singapore Airlines (SA) are often voted the best airline and long haul business class travel is a luxury if you can afford it. SA team up with New Zealand Airlines to get you to and from New Zealand. I preferred SA business class to NZ but I prefer NZ premium economy to SA premium economy. The service was excellent by both carriers. However, its worthwhile checking the time your are given to make your connection. In our case, although the flight was advertised as a scheduled flight we had about 30 minutes to make the connecting flight. Any delay results in missing the connection and then you have a minimum 10 hour wait. Singapore Changi is a huge airport and the distances between Terminals is huge. The crew organised us a golf buggy which sped us to our connection.",positive

2859,First time with Singapore Airlines. We have just returned from a trip to Singapore and Vietnam which we booked to fly with Singapore Airlines. We had heard good reports of the service provided and we weren't disappointed. Our return journey was via Paris Charles de Gaulle where we were met off the inbound flight at Terminal 1 by an airline representative who escorted us to Terminal 2E for our ongoing flight. We had not expected this but having completed the rather torturus transfer we were pleased that this had been arranged. We would certainly look to use Singapore Airlines in the future.,positive

619,"Singapore Airlines Food We travelled with Singapore Airlines from Europe to NZ for Christmas. It has been four years since we last travelled with them. The staff, as always, were excellent. However, the food was not good at all and has taken a notable decline in quality. We were in economy, and we can’t expect the 5 star food that is served at the front of the plane but the economy food, on all four flights was poor. The highlight were the pot noodles…

This is important when travelling with children, that they have something tasty to eat to see then through the long flights. Our kids didn’t eat any of the meals they received and they aren’t fussy eaters. There was no fruit or entree offered. 

We were disappointed with this aspect of the flights. Hopefully Singapore can get back to the standard they used to have with their economy food, as they have always been our first choice for our flights to NZ.",neutral
96,"Impossible to talk to a human, website booking can’t be complicated but still the best in the Pacific I have been flying Singapore Airlines for 42 years. There is no question that it is not the airline it once was. However, on this route it is still far far better than any other option. Service is far better as is the food, etc than United. My last business flight with United was shocking. Service was non existant and food on the long flight was just sad. As one passenger said who had slept through a meal - “Do you just have kids food for snacks?”.  Cathay Pacific was a form of torture with tight seats and flight boarding that is total mayhem. SIA is trying and still the best. I would warn you that having traveled with them after two surgeries in the past the wheel chair service in Changi  is abysmal and the United Polaris clubs are nicer.  SIA is also particularly hard to get a status match - even for United 1K or Million Milers. They also have a website that rejects a lot of itineraries meaning you have to book separately. Where they REALLY  are TERRIBL is communication as it is nearly impossible to get a human. The chat feature proved useless for me recently, even after he forwarded an itinerary that an agent said was impossible. Very frustrating! At least United has good Milage Plus service and no PIN is needed to contact them. However, I JUST booked a flight with SIA and know I will have several more in the next year. They are the best over the Pacific if you don’t mind the nightmare of their website and customer service.",positive

The plane travelled in had more legroom than usual and seats more comfortable, the crew were constantly around with trays of water or juice. Each time I got up for a stretch I returned to my seat loaded with snacks which really helped the 6 movies go by. Flight crew were all lovely and extremely friendly, would fly with them again. Main meals were very good.  
Second leg not so great, legroom almost nonexistent and the seats were nowhere near as comfortable, while the service was still good, this crew were not around the cabin as much and this really let them down, meals very ordinary.

I rang them a month ago to confirm by when can I change my flights  and I was told by the end of June, than I don’t have to pay extra fees on top of the $50 US. I called on the 2nd June to rebook my flights and I was told that the money was refunded to the company that went under liquidation in august. This came as a shock as for months I was told that my tickets were paid for and that Singapore airlines will hold my tickets. I also received a email from the airline manager ( Dejan Eminagic), who stated that my tickets were confirmed. I was fed with false information by the Singapore airlines staff for more than a year.

734,"SQ 442 - Get a Better Plane for the Singapore-Kathmandu Route! The Boeing 737-800 had a business class cabin for 12. The seats must have been taken from a provincial bus somewhere in the 1970s and bolted onto the floor of this aircraft. They had no redeeming feature. The recline was almost unnoticeable, The footrest had to be brought up 6 inches from the floor by manually pulling on a lever that seemed obstinate. We had bulkhead seats - there was zero stowage; the pillow and the blanket were in our laps (unless we put them behind our backs and made our ride more uncomfortable than it already was). The entertainment system comprised an iPad with headphones. 
The food choice was limited, and the wines even more limited. One red (a cheap Chianti) and one white was all that was available. 
This was a 5-hour flight that was uncomfortable from beginning to end - to put it mildly. Couldn't wait to land in Kathmandu. And this was after paying more than $3,000 each for a Manila-Kathmandu-Manila ticket (via Singapore), Shocking!
We chose NOT to fly on this aircraft on the return journey; didn't make much sense in sitting bolt upright for 5 hours at night when a business class seat should be offering you some semblance of lie-flat.

As i pre-ordered my daughter's kid's meal , it was served before everyone else.

Of course we were at the front and all the people behind us hurriedly marched along and got there in front of us! Hmmm,, disadvantaged, seeing as we were up the front originally.

Then a woman in front of us was with her two young sons, held us all up for up to 40 minutes as she decided to upgrade to business while checking in.  We were furious and called the manager, she wasn’t too apologetic about it. Only explained the reason, which we guessed anyway.",positive

The flights themselves were very good despite the turbulence which we experienced especially on the legs between Singapore and South Africa.
Take offs and landings we so smoothe. Food quality was very good by economy class standards as were the variety of beverages on offer. 
The only downside were the overly demanding Indian passengers who are condescending towards flight attendants and behave as though their needs are the only ones requiring attention.

I enjoyed the custom drinks they served on this flight which I did not see on other airlines.  I only tried the Mid Summer Breeze which was a fizzy concoction of 7-up, pineapple, apple and orange juices.  Quite refreshing.

8616,"best airline yet my wife and I where celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary by going to Thailand for the first time, we where flying out on my wife's birthday from Manchester.
when we got to the airport I realized I had forgot to pick up the passports and had to dash back home to get them taking my wife's mobile with me, the Singapore airline staff at Manchester was extremely helpful towards my wife, especially a member of staff call Steven, who let my wife use his phone to check on my progress, when I got back to the airport I thanked him for helping my wife and looking after her.
The helpfulness and cheeriness didn't end there it was the same on the aircraft, always smiling and always ready to help and assist.
On our return journey back home to England, my wife got bit by a mosquito on her left finger and arm, we thought nothing of it at first but when it started to swell up I got a bit concerned as she doesn't normally react like that, I asked a stewardess if they had anything my wife could apply to the bite, she came back with a cleansing wipe and some antiseptic cream them the chief steward came and ask if she was ok and that if she needed a doctor they could arrange it for when we land, he kept checking on her and offered a cold compress to help get the swelling down, I thought the attentiveness and concern was exemplary, it put us at ease.
On the first leg of our 3 leg trip back to England a member of the staff gave my wife a birthday cake and a small gift, and said it was from Singapore Airlines, we thought that was a great gesture which (pardon the pun) put the icing on the cake for our holiday.

3394,"Quickest flight to the UK Flew Wellington, Melbourne, Singapore, Heathrow. It was the fastest we’ve flown, with minimal stopovers (1.5hours) in Melbourne and Singapore. Great way to go if you don’t want to hang around unnecessarily in airports.",positive
8246,"Lacklustre, impersonal, task driven service. I used to fly regularly with Singapore Airlines between London and Sydney but had not done so for about ten years. I booked this trip on the basis of previous experience when I remember excellent and faultless service, great attention to detail, good seats and great entertainment. One feature of that service was that you were unfailingly addressed by name by the crew. I looked forward to my journey and bear in mind that I paid a premium for it over and above what I could have paid another airline but I was willing to pay it because Singapore Airlines presents itself as unmatched and the best in the business. They might have been once but they are certainly not now and are at best average. 

Check in at Heathrow was rather chaotic, there were five desks open for first and business class although two of them were designated first class and bear in mind that Singapore Airlines only have six first class seats on the A380 so rather overkill. The queue moved reasonably quickly and the person working was polite. 

I made my way to the lounge, there are four choices of lounge in terminal two, all accessible with a business class boarding pass. Having been to them all I would rate the Singapore Airlines lounge as last of the four, the food offering is the poorest of the four and on other fronts it's certainly no better. 

Boarding was efficient but then that's self managed through automated gates and the same for any airline in terminal two. 

The A380 on the London - Singapore sector was one of the newest with their latest business class seats. I found the seat most uncomfortable. It's way too hard for a long flight, the leg rest is totally useless and doesn't elevate to any useful angle and to put your feet up you are forced to sit at an angle which is not particularly comfortable and after a while I had a sore back so was left with the choice of a sore back or don't put my feet up. The seat does go fully flat but I doubt most people spend more than 50% of the flight in a fully flat position so something of a fail. The seat also boasts a high level of privacy. I would define that as claustrophobic as the seat is so enclosed that's what it felt like. 

The service of food and drinks was very task driven and impersonal. Over both the sectors I was not addressed by name on a single occasion. I found it quite disconcerting that the norm for the crews seemed to be to take things from a trolley and put them down on your tabel without even acknowledging you, on several occasions things were put down while the crew member had her back to me and she talked to her colleague across the trolley. Most airlines do not even have trolleys in the aisles in business class these days. 

The food was at best average. There is no choice of starter, a choice of mains, two puddings and a cheese course. There is no flexibility in the times of service and you eat when the crew decide you should. Between meals there is a range of mediocre snacks. 

The inflight entertainment system is good but no better than that of others. 

The aircraft between Singapore and Sydney was a 77W and it features an older version of the seat with still no possibility of using a leg rest and the impossibility of putting your feet up unless you sit at an angle. This was a day time service so a flat bed was inappropriate. The older seat is slightly more padded than its newer relation so slightly less uncomfortable. The service on this sector was no better and just as task driven and impersonal. 

The return journey was no better, just more impersonal, task driven service. The older A380 was poorly maintained internally with lots of scuff marks and poor seat controls. 

I also find in 2018 the previously iconic 'Singapore girl' sexist and outdated. It really is time this was dumped and the crew were allowed to dress more appropriately for their role. You do not see women in vibrant and forward thinking Singapore going around dressed like this!

So, I wouldn't again be willing to pay a premium for Singapore Airlines as I don't consider that they are now in any way industry leading, in fact they are definitely in the lower half of the pack and trading on past glory while charging a lot of money for the average offering. Others offer better for less money and on future journeys I will look to them for my travel needs.",neutral

9918,"Not much to differentiate the big guys Managed to get an upper deck economy seat which definitely helps with trying to get some sleep. The side bunker is useful if you want to try and work as you can spread out a little bit - don't get excited I said a LITTLE bit.
I'd say Singapore Airlines headrests are the best of the bunch as I didn't need the added travel scarf that I use for support. 
Meals were very average I had a lacto-ovo vegetarian as prefer to get heaps of veg and fruit.
Air stewards did a great job on a very bumpy last leg which saw them sitting on the floor at one stage because they couldn't get back to their seats before some really big turbulence hit. I couldn't do their job - all credit to them.
As per my title there is not much to differentiate the big airlines from each other so the choice comes down to routes and times and how it all fits.",neutral

211,"Mediocre service in Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines Oh how the Premium Economy (PE) service has dropped on Singapore Airlines (SA) - not good compared to other PE serviced airlines. In PE you pay extra (a lot extra) this normally includes individual welcoming, a hot towelette and in many cases a drink prior to takeoff.  None of this on SA it was an extraordinary amount clutter and confusion through out the PE cabin. One alcohol drink prior to meal service with there wine pours being half a small plastic glass , no offered alcohol drink at meal service, meals through ""Book the Cook"" were not good at all but oh offered plenty of glasses of water throughout trip. Come on SA what has happened to your past extraordinary service that was legendary.  Folks if you choose to have a little more comfort and service, choose another airline as Singapore Air has chosen to be a just another mediocre airline.",negative
3798,"Training on the go! SQ655 My first encounter was the cabin crew at the tail end, I witness for the first time requesting my violin placed in a safe storage from a young stewardess. The 
Chief Steward Mr Alex Lee took this opportunity to ask her a few question if she knew what’s the procedures to the passenger and she did and also answered well. Good training and guidances from a senior!

Unlike the last trip where there’s a team of leading stewards and chief seniors, this was like a group of apprentice and new crew learning and they’re doing an excellent job!

Good improvement in the cabin spaces and seat comfort. Legroom increased and I can even cross my leg easily while seated down. Recliner is slightly lower for the 787 and it lowered smoothly unlike its predecessors. However the Side panel control still gets triggered if passenger is too plump eg. reading light and calling steward assistance by accident!

As for extra leg room the touch screen is where it’s a slight pain to one who has short arms. It’s mounted on the wall unlike the former fittings where it is housed inside the armrest therefore you may need to stretch a little to reach the touch screen...",positive

260,"Tedious Manual Process for Redemption Ticket I needed to use all my accrued points that were about to expire from not being able to travel during the last 2 +years of Covid.

The process of trying to get a flight was 100% manual, i.e. calling in to speak with an associate, and relying on the associates to verbally relay to you what flight is available.  The website and app do not work.  I have been playing with it for a long time. I consider myself to be a tech. savvy user.  

I had to call 4 times, and finally actually got the mileage redemption ticket via United associates who were able to identify the mileage redemption class ticket on Eva Air for me.  Shame on KrisFlyer team!

Singapore airline is totally overrated.  Having a good in-flight service is only one component of customer experience.  But having an outdated system that does not bring convenience needs to be highlighted when considering being a long-term value member.",negative

The staff on-board were very pleasant & helpful.  Our seats were roomy & the screens on the back of the seats were very good & they have a lot of variety of things to watch.

We pre-booked our seats & it was seamless.  the only thing is you now have to pay to pre-book your allocated seats.",positive
769,"Best Economy Class Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class, spacious sets with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid, (same excuse to save money and weight_ a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was ice-cream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first.  IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work.",positive

We looked forward to the flight as it was a new A350-900 - The aircraft was great but the airline economists (bean counters) went for lightweight seats that were not comfortable for a long flight. Seats with an additional 1-2 cm of padding would help with comfort over long distances.,neutral
9725,"A classy flying experience The Singapore Airlines flight to Manchester has been operating for a couple of years now - and it's certainly one of the best routes to the UK from Houston, although the price is beginning to get up there with the likes of BA and United now. However, the flight crew are SO attentive and really want to make the flight an enjoyable and thoroughly pleasant experience. For a cocktail, the Singapore Sling is a must! The food is always good and snacks, drinks and food plentiful. The A-350 is a good workhorse for this route - spacious and quiet. My only criticism is that the carry on baggage allowance weight is strictly enforced - meaning that very often, even if only a kilo over the carry on allowance, your hand luggage has to be checked. I really don't see the point in this as the overhead bins are usually half empty. Altogether though, a great flight, reminiscent of how flights used to be.",positive

With my latest trip, I just found out that after confirming my seat, that was cancelled and I now have to book another seat that is in a worse location. Yet the airline can't offer any satisfactory explanation. For an airline that is charging a serious premium over its peers, this is unacceptable.

5433,"Easily sets the bar for Business Class Airline travel I try to review Business Class travel as well as hotels, because i like noting the comparisons and approaches in style of different airlines. If i were an airline executive trying to consider my Business Class experience one of the first things i would do is to go on this flight between LAX and Singapore with Singapore Airlines. If only to see what the current benchmark in business class travel is.

Now i am sure that you can buy your own first class apartment on a plane with a Gulf based carrier these days and i am sure you could argue that there is a level above this in commercial air travel and i am sure you are right but this is regular business class.

Apart from the nice lounge and delightful service when boarding the plane you essentially get your own entire private capsule, looking away from everyone else you get this tremendous feeling of space. Whereas Virgin and Delta point you inwards, Singapore point you outwards. It gives a tremendous sense of space, you dotn really feel like you are with a lot of other people.

And then there is the space they actually give you - it is a gigantic personal area you have, not only the seat - which i remember being massive on Singapore - but the lying space, the space at the side of you to put things, the charging space for your devices, all of it, there is just a really lovely sense of space. Clean, bright, private space, and that is above everything else is what you want.

But then add to that the proper lie flat bed (this is a 16 hour flight you are bound to need to sleep during some of it), which isnt a seat that goes flat but rather the kind that folds forward to create a proper flat bed, and in this case it cant be too much smaller than a normal single bed. Comfortable bedding and nice toiletries.

Couple that with the legendary Singapore service, the attentive staff, good food, plenty of water and it is a very very well put together offering.

But not perfect - here are two things i would call out, one is physical, one is a question of timing. So in the physical space, it is not quite long enough. When you have the bed out its just an inch or two too short, so you find yourself having to curl your knees which is a bit frustrating and i can imagine for someone taller than i am (Im 6ft) would be an issue. The other thing is the way they time the flight, i couldnt figure it out, they serve dinner after about 7 hours which means that they expect you to sleep before dinner - which is weird because you are leaving LA at 1130 in the morning and so bedding down for a nights sleep is weird. They told me it was because they were working on Singapore time but that sounded like a strange answer when youve just left LA. So i think there is some work they could do on their flight plan to get the timing and inter-sections of when things happen more logically defined. I guess that is flight specific though and shouldnt detract from the great effort they have made to continue to define the bar in Business Class travel.",positive
5491,"One of the better airlines. I have flown with them many times and they are consistently very good. 

The one BIG negative to me is that they provide the front seats to people with infants to utilise bassinet clips. One previous flight I was in Premium Economy and had a screaming infant directly behind me on the bulkhead, hence I won't pay the extra any more. It is also a dangerous practice as they rows with extra room are those to be utilised in an emergency, for example one exit side is blocked these rows would be the crossover point.

The staff are always friendly and efficient and food better than average.

With the exception of their bassinet policy one of my favourite airlines.",positive
9580,"Viaggio in Indonesia It was the first time I was traveling with this Asian company, I made two legs in the first leg (12 hours + 3 hours) and two legs on the way back (3 hours + 12 hours)
The planes were A350-900 aibus, so a very recent model and very clean inside.
The distance between the rows of seats was sufficient even for a robust adult and each station was equipped with a touch monitor with joystick, free there are available to the traveler numerous films (recently produced) in multiple languages and also several games with which my son was entertained for hours.
The trip was comfortable and the on-board staff was really courteous and helpful.
The ground staff was always very courteous and even in the first leg, although there had been a problem with the stroller that had remained in Singapore, they solved it in a few hours making it arrive immediately with the next flight.
In the future, I will definitely try to travel with this company again",positive

Only saving grace was the ground staff and flight attendants were wonderful.",negative
5660,A wonderful flight with Singapore as usual. We fly reasonably regularly to London Heathrow and we just love Singapore business. My wife now needs wheelchair assistance at big international airports like Changi and Heathrow and this is organised seamlessly. The lounges are comfortable well stocked and have very helpful staff. Seating in business is spacious and very comfortable with seemingly endless adjustments. The flat bed allows a pretty good sleep although I can never work out how to get it in sleeping mode although there is always cabin crew there to help me. The food is very good and beautifully presented. There is a huge entertainment library and the system is easy to use. Deservedly Singapore is always at the very top of best long haul airlines. We would always prefer to use SIA business.,positive
3999,"Singapore Airlines A350 Regional to Perth Singapore Airlines regional A350 has all the advantages of a modern wide body airplane. The high ceilings, wide aisles and extra large windows give an airy feel. The pressurisation to a lower equivalent altitude makes one feel refreshed at the end of the flight. SQs inflight entertainment system remains one of the best in the business. I like the position of the earphone connector which takes it away from the tray table and passenger- this avoids entangling of the cord with your food and clothing. Inflight service was spot on- even with ""special requests"" for green tea or White Russians. My one complaint with this plane and the 787-10 is the thin seat cushion( I am told it is an elastic sling like a hammock)- this causes buttock aches on longer flights. My suggestion is to ask for an extra blanket or pillow for extra padding. Perhaps SQ should avoid fitting this seat in the future.",positive

Our flights and lounge visits exceeded our expectations and we have again booked Singapore Airlines for May 2020. We received the most amazing customer service from every staff member but the highest credit must go to Patricia of the Singapore Airlines Business Class Lounge in Singapore.  Patricia observed that my husband was unwell and a little concerned about the distance from lounge to gate.

6675,"Used to care about customers--not anymore I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly to India from SFO. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers.
I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight (like Emirates, or even China airlines, offers) and I have more than 50,000 pts. No offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business.

Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C.  

While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my over 50000 points, Singapore airlines charge me for a whole piece. So watch out, even if you are just 3- 4 kgs over the limit, they will charge the cost of a whole suitcase. This is another example of not caring for customers. They can charge per Kg weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines do--no, they are special because they go the tag of 'World's best airlines' :(. Not allowing me to pay extra baggage with my points, no consideration if you are Kris flyer member with 1000s of points, they just don't care about you but want to make you pay for everything. 
Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore)  and the bathroom cleanliness while going and coming was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course.

I am not sure I will  be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for reasonable price, cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with more than 50,000 points though.",negative

Flew back with a three hour lay-over  in Singapore which was manageable as we had free access to the Singapore Airlines Lounge to shower eat and rest. All the way in one day is however a challenge and what I would say is that paying to upgrade for that flight might have been worth the money as we were economy for all flights. Economy is still a good experience with this airline with excellent in-flight service and very modern aircraft - however for the 14 hours for Singapore to London flying West ... economy plus or even business class would be money well spent and easier all round.Overall Singapore Airlines are nice to fly with, staff and service excellent and worth the money.",positive

Had no idea until near the end of a 13 hour flight that you could request snacks and alcohol (as none offered) from back of plane but pretty poor selection. IFE system very poor, irritating to navigate and poor selection. Games didn't work on any of the 4 legs we had. Again, much better selection on the cheap charter airlines. Only positives were the short legs from Singapore to siem reap and back. Much better service, same size seats! 737 cleaner and newer than the a380 or 777.

9315,"Genuinely Caring Our daughter suffers badly from air sickness, after our initial trip to England where she was sick the whole way on Qantas, understandably she was worried and upset about the long flight ahead going home, shortly after we took our seats, and as all would be aware how hectic it is during the boarding,  one of the fantastic flight attendants noticed her and asked if all was OK, to which we advised her concerns, he said he would keep checking on her to make sure she was OK, he was back in no time with water, cold flannel etc etc, and continued to keep on checking and paying extra attention to her during our flight, a breath of fresh air compared to our fight on Qantas. It was so assuring to see genuine concern and care, surprisingly she made it all the way without being or feeling sick! coincidence or not?",positive
7941,Comfortable flight I fly with this airline often and although I have had one issue with them earlier in the year I find them to be Fair with there prices and the flights to be comfortable. The food is ok and the staff on board are welcoming.. inflight entertainment is of good selection. On a scale of 1-10 I would give them a 8 there is always room for improvement and if I was to choose where that is I would say the price even though they are fair but could be fairer when it comes to holiday period,positive
2141,Very efficient operation Singapore Airlines was extremely efficient at getting over 200 people & all of their luggage to transfer from one airplane coming into Singapore to another going to Bali in less than 30 minutes!,positive
2498,"Truly A Great Way to Fly Always a very pleasant flight with Singapore Airlines. Premium economy was definitely a worth while splurge. Seat was comfy with super fluffy pillow. Champagne was nice, food was ok. Entertainment selection was good. Luggage service was quick.
All and all, highly recommended.",positive
3909,"Very good when everything works, but if not... Because the direct flight to Singapore was fully booked when I needed to travel I had to transfer in Milano. Because of the fact that I could not check in until Jakarta in Frankfurt (I booked it as a connecting flight) my luggage got lost in Milano. In Milano there is no transfer desk for Singapore airlines.
I finally got my luggage 2 days later. I asked for compensation and after 5 weeks (!) they responded that I'm not eligible for that. Basically they are hiding behind hotlines and e-mail and only reply with the standard Q&A. 
Their level of service is not even dependent on your status of the class of travel (I got Krisflyer Gold).
So, if everything works well its a nice airline, but beware if they make a mistake...",neutral
4828,"Excellent Service Flew to Brisbane on SQ265 last month and was really impressed with their new Airbus A350-900.  The seats in economy were very comfortable and they have simplified their TV system by going only touch screen.  The awkward remote is gone and doesn't complicate the seat armrests any further.  There is a USB port located under the TV screen as well as an earphone port, making it all fuss free.  The service was really good but having flown a few different airlines over the last few years, nothing beats Singapore air.",positive
701,"NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE I have flown many times on Singapore Airlines over the past 15 years except during Covid 2020-2021.
I was looking forward to my flights booking again, but how the level of service has changed for the worst.
Cebu - Singapore was on budget airline Scoot, the low-cost carrier of the Singapore Airlines Group.
Nice meal served chicken and vegetables - up to standard for a budget airline. I paid $4 for a cup of tea. I was ready for the usual very good meal on the 2nd leg Singapore to Sydney. It used to be entre fruits with beautiful main meal, This time is was one meal - 6 chunks of chicken on a huge bed of noodles. And that's it. No veges - very plain cheap meal. I had a cup of tea and later an ice cream. Guess what - the meal on the Scoot the budget airline was far better than what was served on the main Singapore Airlines flight. No chance of a second cup of tea - the crew zoomed down the aisles with trolleys so fast, call out and they don.t stop. No drinks later in the flight except just before landing and water only. used to be regular service of juices AND a snack meal 60-90 minutes before landing in Sydney.
It appears this airline is making up for lost income during covid by giving less food and beverages during flights. Well on a nearly 8 hour flight on a top reputation international airline you do expect a meal of reasonable quality not at a standard below budget airlines. 
Best they jack up the price by say $25 and give passengers the food and beverage service they are used to. I also might add I greatly miss the Chess game that was always in the Games in In-flight Entertainment. Chess should be a standard inclusion but they have taken it out. A budget decision?",negative
9442,"In style When we decided to travel to Singapore and Hongkong we chose Singapore airlines as they had a good name the price was good and also being their home area, we were not disappointed although we were in enonomy class we were treated first class from the time we boarded until we left the plane the staff always with a smile doing everything to make your journey enjoyable. The meals are first rate hot tasty and plentiful plus a good drink selection, inflight entertainment consists of a great range of movies music enough to cover every ones needs seats are comfortable, plane was presented spotless and kept that way throughout the flight by the crew we have been back twice now and are looking for our third trip and would not fly with anyone else.",positive
3082,"Still the best This flight from Manchester employs the Airbus A350-900 whereas the Heathrow option is on the larger A380. I much prefer the benefits of higher pressurisation and humidity with the A350 which do make a difference.
Manchester Airport is very busy but efficient and less of a hassle than Heathrow.
I have travelled with Qatar and Emirates but still prefer Singapore Airlines for consistency and connections at Changi.",positive
7922,"Pleasant red eye flight Wonderful to be flying in SQ, this time to Christchurch. We were the first to board the Boeing 777-200ER. Seats were in 1-2-1 configuration with aisle access to every passenger in business class.

The food, as expected, was amazing; keeping in mind that we are in a pressurised cabin 30,000ft up in the air and our taste buds go nuts.

Seats were comfortable; better than the 2007 business class version. Lots of thoughtful storage spaces. Managed to get 5 hours of sleep in the flat ""bed"".",positive
2175,"The best by a long way Numerous round trips Manchester - Houston  in economy all consistently as good as it will ever get. Two full meals and a mid flight snack better than the journey’s end fare supplied by other airlines. The roast turkey on Christmas Eve was worthy of a good restaurant as was the later meal. The cheapest and best every time.  Good service from checking in to getting off. Brand new planes, better seats, excellent service. I doubt the authenticity of some of the “reviews” I’ve been reading. I cross the Atlantic frequently with a cross section of airlines flying into various hubs. Singapore Airlines economy is better then premium economy in any of the competitors I’ve tried.",positive
941,"Shoutout to leading steward Mr Cheong Paid premium price for SQ (most expensive as compared to other international carriers) only to receive basic service. I think this is the only airline that does not allow us to choose our preferred seats in advance, well unless you wanna fork out extra money. *roll eyes* Got stuck in the middle seat of a full flight on the way back home, with the SAME TYPE of meat for our halal food option which is lamb. Whats worst is both of us do not eat lamb and we cant even specify this down when we were selecting our halal food requirement. Luckily the leading flight steward, Mr Cheong, was empathetic towards us and help us change to a seafood meal instead. He also came checking up on us every now and then to see if we were doing fine and accommodating to our every needs. Its nice to come back home to this kind of impeccable service... With that said, SQ has still so much to improve in terms of food quality (fish has some kind of smell, lamb was not cooked properly, pudding was not nice at all - better stick to ice creams) Only delicious thing was the Turkish baklava.

On another flight to Heathrow, my sister asked for seafood instant noodles but was also not provided. One of my friend did not get her Halal food even though she has already requested for this way in advance, reason because they had ""overlooked"" it and they do not have any extra to cater for her. Next time we will just stick with Emirates... well at least we have the option to choose a window seat without paying extra.",neutral

Staff are really good and attentive and the service is very good.
Lots of food and drink even on the short legs of our trip. The choice and quality was really good. 
I didn’t think the entertainment choice was that good to be honest, not many films I would of wanted to watch. 
The amenity kit is rubbish compared to the likes of Qatar and virgin. yes we got a pillow and a blanket and could get a set of headphones on the way onto the aircraft. But only a toothbrush, toothpaste and a pair of socks. No earbuds or eye mask but not the end of the world.

5562,"Surprisingly Bad Service For long haul flights (especially going to Europe), my husband and I usually fly with Qatar Airways but this year because QR""s rates were higher than expected, we explored other airlines. Though other airlines like Saudia and Etihad were substantially lower than QR, SQ and EK, we decided to go with Singapore Airlines (SQ) because we previously experienced good service over all. Unfortunately, not for the SG-ZRH leg of our trip. 

We were seated near the galley and we found out that wasn't a good place to be assigned. We were always served last and by the time the attendants reach us, there were no more choices of food. Also, they always rush past you in and out, hence, if you have a request you have to wait a while to be served or noticed.

Also, for some reason, SQ provides amenity kits only when you ask to be given one when the attendants with big plastic carrier pass by. If you're not paying attention or is asleep, you won't be given one. 

Disappointing because our previous experiences with SQ were good. The premium cost we paid to fly with them was not worth it. 

We'll be going back to QR next time.",neutral

2037,"Huge payment glitch at booking - Poor recognition of frequent flyers This happened when booking a ticket for a trip in June 2020. Singapore airlines website has a timeout bug at the payment level and I had to book several times the same ticket. After my card got rejected on the fourth attempt I realized that they have been charging my card each time. I had to increase my card limit and top up big time to book a fourth time over the phone with an agent. What follows is a nightmare. Extremely difficult to get the failed bookings payments removed from my card. Took very long (still not over) with all the impacts you can imagine on using my card for any other expenses
Singapore airlines proposed to give me 2000 miles for the inconvenience which I refused. This was an amazingly cheap offer for the tens of hours spent over the phone with them, with my bank, organizing conference calls, managing my credit card failed payments and all the emotional impacts this all triggers.
Singapore airlines, you are too greedy. Now I understand why in 15 years being with you as a PPS and gold member I have never been upgraded. I will try other airlines.",negative

Last Flew on SQ was almost 10yrs ago, which I remembered the flight was cold and cozy.
But this flight has been a very terrible experience,  seat was not comfortable,  front seats is too closed , very difficult to view the screen on the seat in front of u.

Worst part is the air control,  its not cold but very warm and stuffy!  There wasn't any air vent hole for u to control the cold air blowing at you. But seems to come from the top. It's more like a dehumidifier setting rather than aircon . I saw ppl around me all fanning themselves! 

Yes ppl have to fan themselves like in the 80s where buses have no aircon , hot stuffy and soaking with perspiration atvthe end of the 5-6hr flight!!!

Most aspects were very good: entertainment, food, service. However, the seating was well below expectations. Not only was the seat uncomfortable, but the row spacing was also very tight. I am below average height but I could barely move my legs. Moreover, the entertainment screen on the seat in from was very close to my face, even when that seat was not reclined. This might be tolerable on a short flight but for 8 hours it was very hard to take. Are Singapore Airlines resting on their laurels?

6600,"Great service but.... We flew from Adelaide to Rome, Paris to Adelaide and felt that the service was great. For some reason, Singapore Airlines don't have Premium Economy on the Adelaide-Singapore (and return) leg of our journey so that remains a disappointment. The Premium Economy legs were so much more comfortable and have spoilt us for travelling Economy for the long hauls, if we can ever afford the extra expense again. The food, drinks and service were great, as in a previous trip, but the IT side of the airline really needs some serious work as we had a ridiculous amount of trouble with the website time and again. So much so, that both times we've travelled to Europe we had to spend ages on the phone while we were overseas trying to sort out an issue.
We really enjoyed the service and personnel, but both times we travelled the website was painful and resulted in phone calls instead. The difficulty we've experienced with the website for checking in, securing seats, payments etc, would be the only thing that would cause us to look at another carrier.",positive

Movies on flight entertainment system was also new and has an USB charger. In-flight food was also delicious, can choose from Chinese or Singaporean style dishes. Plane from Singapore-Istanbul was not so new, no USB charger, but seats were also comfortable. During the 10 hour flight, the crew provided good service, always asked if passengers needed anything.

The planes feel so much better; they are cleaner, more comfortable, the seats feel more spacious, and the entertainment is fantastic. Unlike US airlines, all drinks are included in the price.  And also unlike US airlines, the staff are pleasant, helpful and don't make you feel like you are ruining their day simply by being on their plane.

Has anyone else ever experienced this before?  By going overdrawn on that account, it has given me no end of problems, least of which was being left stranded at a petrol station with no way of paying for the fuel.

Courteous, smiling crew welcomes you into the flight. The seats were comfortable, legroom was sufficient, temperature controls were good, and in-flight entertainment provides the passenger with a lot of options to choose from.The food served was delicious(All of the other airlines I have traveled so far in have not yet managed to do this!), lot of options are available for alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages. But, unfortunately, in the flight I was in, the in-flight entertainment stopped working the moment cabin crew started with the safety instructions.

9122,"SINGAPORE AIRLINES NEW PREMIUM ECONOMY CABIN A350-900 The past 10 months Singapore Airlines has centered a lot of focus around their new A350-900 planes and the newly improved Premium Economy class product so we decided to hop on the direct service at 11.55pm on SQ246 from Brisbane to Singapore to see for ourselves. 

Premium economy was spacious and head height was great for all those tall people.  

The plane flight in itself was superb, it was so smooth it didn’t even feel like you were flying.  Plane was very clean and well maintained. 

New comfortable leather seats with reading lights extended from the seat but the big plus the extra recline, more legroom, extendable footrest and larger windows.  

If you’re aren't able to splash out on business class as the average traveler can’t I say spend that little extra on Premium Economy for the extra comfort on a long haul flight. 

Menu was good but presentation needs a little bit of tweaking, it’s not economy food and certainly not at the business level neither and don’t be offended by drinking champagne out of a plastic glass. 

Cabin crew for the flight were very polite as always but felt both meal services were very rushed and the service level is not what Singapore Airlines was well known in the early days.

They’ve upgraded the headphones with noise cancellation including a superior quality pillow and blanket. 

You receive an amenities pouch but don’t expect to much you get a pair of socks with a miniature toothbrush and toothpaste. 

Configuration is 2-4-2 with a total of 24 seats in the class. Our tip, choose Row 31 even more legroom (as per photo) our choice was 31A-B on the window and aisle. 

Paying for Premium Economy does not give you privilege to the Silver Kris Lounge however if you are a Gold Kris Flyer or a Gold Velocity Frequent flyer and above you receive that access where you can sit upstairs for e.g. Brisbane International airport lounge and watch over gate 81 where you will embarking for your journey as it prepares for it’s departure.  

When in Singapore you have access to Kris Flyer Gold Lounge which is great to refresh and recharge for your connecting flight.  Safe travels and happy flying ✈️

Firat leg on 380 to Singapore was good.  Small P.E. area with its own washroom facilities and dedicted stewards.  Whole area was spotless and new.  The calf rest is useless if the seat in front reclines which also means leaving your seat requires a limbo manouvre. We had book the cook but the food was not good.  Regular food lookd better.  1.5 hr change in Singapore is a long, long, long walk.  Shall have assistance on return.  Singapore to Sydney was very old, very worn Boeing 777.  Had to go through  Economy to washrooms which was a long walk through narrow aisles on a very bumpy flight.  So many people using washrooms meant they became untidy.  The seats were not comfortable, calf rests useless as on earlier flight.  Seat pockets in front were broken and exposing sharp metal fixings.  Stewards on both legs were helpful and very pleasant.

I last flew two years ago and was so impressed by the space of the seat and leg room I was happy to be going with them again, even if they were the more expensive choice. What a shock. They have reduced the seat and pitch size. 
We did depart on time and in row order. The teenager in front of me reclined as soon as we were airborne for the whole 7.1/2 hour daytime flight and my entertainment screen was a hands-length away from my face!  Ran out of everything but beef by the time they got to us (seat 47).  We arrived safe and sound however, but the whole experience was disappointing. 
Returning on A380 was better. We were on the upper deck economy which was roomier than the 777 plus has the added storage next to the window, plus there was just 2 not 3 in the row by the window (YAY).  The food was dire though and almost inedible but at least we had the bread rolls and cheese/crackers were okay. 
So ultimately it is okay BUT it is still economy and you will have the squeezed in experience with no real bells and whistles. Is it worth paying hundreds more than other carriers?  I won't go out of my way to book with them again unless it really suits or they have a deal going.",positive

Have traveled Business Class before but value for money it is worth the change to Premium Economy. 
Will definitely fly this class again.",positive
550,"Flight on SQ 712 The flight was pleasant and the meal was tasty. The crew was friendly. This was only a short flight.

Luckily a wheelchair was available on arrival in Bangkok and a long walk was made easy for my wife. The wheelchair attendant even took her out to the taxi, great service.",positive
2802,Great airline with excellent staff! From check-in to disembarking Singapore Airlines were wonderful. The check-in agent at ORT airport was so friendly. With my Dad making use of a wheelchair the cabin crew were great. On board service was efficient and seamless. Nothing was to much for them. We experienced the same outstanding service at Changi airport all the way back home to Johannesburg.,positive
3316,"Baggage claim I’m very disappointed about my flight last night SQ 968 SIN-CGK 06 october 2019, because my baggage still at SG. After i’m arrived at CGK arround 11 PM and still process my complaint to Jakarta Airport Service. Can you imagine how tired i am... FYI all SQ ground staff is already go home.. big applause for your service.. is this your services to passengers who choosing SQ  as full services airlines?? Definitely i’m not choosing your airlines for my next holiday... big surprise for me with your service but still have been rewarded by skytrax. Please improved this service if you want to be best airlines in world..",negative
8892,"Good airline Great service, free food and drinks. Average legroom. Plane was a bit older and there were a few issues with the seatback entertainment system, plug for earphones did not work well. Overall would recommend this airline.",positive
8705,"Shocking, Nightmare & Worst service I've experience, worse than budget airlines Nightmare transfer followed by god damn aweful customer service on the flight. 

Experience began from leaving the aircraft. Despite the flight being later arriving and knowing I had a tight connection, I say this to everyone now. There is no assistance for business class customers transferring. 

You'd think the airline's operations team would pick up business class customers coming in late and on tight transfer windows. Nope nothing at the gate. 

I got a bus to terminal 2, then got lost nearly went through immigration. Asked for help and directions and got to the gate as the flight was boarding. 

On board, well again, the food was average and service was shocking. Having run to catch this connection, when dinner was being served, asked for a beer and wine to go with my dinner. The beer to quench the thirst and wine because I love my vino. Was told will bring to you shortly sir. Nothing. Asked again. Nothing. Asked again nothing. 

3 times and 20mins later. All too late. 

Sat there thinking should I travel Singapore airlines as this is some of the worst service I've had, similar to one of the budget airlines. but not they are actually better. 

Singapore Airlines will fail as a business if this is the level of service offered to premium customers.",negative

I think a bit of room for improvement when it comes to cleanliness of the plane. I know I was travelling in economy but some of the seats looks a little bit worse for wear. I'm sure they'll get upgraded soon enough",positive

Great long haul flight. The crew were fantastic. So welcoming and professional. They are always ready to serve and constantly looking out for our needs. Indeed best airline. The flight was smooth despite some bumpy times but the seats were so comfortable that you can just sleep over the turbulence. Put down the back rest and sleep with the bed. The biz class is so spacious. 

Well done Singapore Airlines.. and thank you.

Looking forward to our return flight.",positive

Flew over in August and came back in September and no updates on the movies so entertaiment was limited as had watched all the best movies on way over.

Singapore Airlines also offer stopover breaks of varying lengths in Singapore which are excellent value for money, had a six night break on last trip, absolutely first class experience.",positive
3327,"First time and was very impressed  Flew from Phuket to Japan transiting Singapore. This was my first time flying SQ and I was impressed. The inflight entertainment, the Cain crew, the food. I will definitely rate them a top airline and perhaps even my newest favourite airline! Changi is a great airport",positive
6516,"Very good - only too little legroom We are flying since many years with SQ. There are some changes which must be attributed to austerity measures - but it is still a great service. The only disadvantage is the small legroom - it is barely possible to leave the seat without bending the whole body and making artistic exercises to get out from the window or middle seat. 
Moreover, it is very unpleasant that there is now an additional fee for the seat of my choice - even if it is a very normal one (not, e.g., a seat with only two on the row or in front of the service room wall)..",positive
5426,"Pleasant flight - Comfortable We were boarded efficiently onto the Airbus. However, the seats that we paid extra for, were not as we saw in the original seat map. The flight was not full. We brought the seat issue to a member of the cabin crew. She took our boarding cards and then a male cabin crew approached us. He offered us seats at the very back of the plane. Totally unsuitable and worse than our current seats. However, another female member smartly diffused the situation with a move to bulkhead seats. I think her name was Audrey (I think). She was professional and efficient. No don't get me wrong. We were not being awkward. We had ten flights to take over a three weeks with a four year old child and our seats were chosen with that in mind.

Anyway, the plane got away five minutes early and arrived 11 minutes early in Shanghai. The flight was comfortable. The cabin crew were courteous and the food was good.",positive
1619,"Confort The seat is not comfortable. You have to stand up to lay down your seat. When you are in the bed position you have to be in diagonal with your legs. The service is very good , people are very kind. But even in the 380 airbus the seats are in the same way...",negative
4842,"Consistently good It has been a number of years since I last flew Singapore and the standard is still there. On a A380 so it was quiet as you would expect. The key elements of the flights were:
1. Staff were friendly and helpful
2. Seats were comfortable and a good size - slightly larger with more leg space. 
3. Food was enjoyable and catered for both Asians and western. 
4. Beverage - the wine list left a bit to be desired, they could improve here. Others such as Bloody Mary's etc were good.
5. Movies - there was an extensive list to chose from, however I felt they could have been better with a few more up to-date one. Also the TV shows were limited.
6. Comfort and safety - cabin was good temperature and the flight was good plus on time.

Overall I was happy with the service of Singapore and will fly again with them.",positive

5498,Makes you feel welcome From check in to departure was hassle free. Friendly air crew & ground staff. Great choice of in flight entertainment.,positive
1235,"Disgraceful service I paid an overinflated £1299 for an economy return to Singapore. Singapore Airlines is currently monopolising the market and overcharging customers brutally. 

Services were abysmal from stepping into the plane. Had to ask for BLANKETS  and PILLOWS for a long haul flight. Commencing the 12.5 hours journey, we were offered 1 meal within the first hour after take off then absolutely nothing, not even a beverage for the next 9 hours. Despite being a day flight, they switched off the cabin lights 3 hours after departure trying to get everyone to sleep so they don't have to work. I went to the galley to ask for food and was only offered a fun pack size chips and a glass of coke with ice, not the 330ml can. Never felt so dehydrated boarding a flight. We were then served a small breakfast meal just before landing. Only positive is the inflight entertainment with a wide selection of Western movies.

This is the worse Singapore Airlines flight I have been on with all the cost cutting measures yet overinflated flights. They do not deserve the 5 star skytrax rating. It feels more like a budget low cost airline. Absolute shambles.",negative
6752,"Service Good But Baggage Damage I recently use Singapore Airline instead of Budget Airline, because I believe that they would take care of my baggage/asset more than budget airline or low cost airline. 
Eventually they treat me like I fly Low cost airline. Is this The Best Airline in the World? I just found out that my parts of my luggage are damage. I believe that it because of your baggage handler throw my bag. 
First I didn’t find out because every time I fly I will put my Luggage cover on so, I didn’t find out until I ‘m going to fly another flight. 
Let me tell you why I didn’t raise up this issue sooner it because when I unpack my back I didn’t see it. (It’s also my false that I didn’t check the whole bag. I just check front, back and handle). If there are just scratches to my baggage cover, it’s fine. I can accept that.
So, I just want to know how Singapore airline handle with baggage handling system for their customer.",neutral
8768,"All good but not great After several years avoiding SQ (old worn interiors, poor service) I decided to give it another try. It was the best route on offer (MEL-BKK-SIN-PEN-SIN-MEL) for this trip.

Overall, the flight between MEL-BKK-MEL (via Singapore) was fine. The A380 and Boeing 777 interiors were vastly improved but the air was unbearably dry and uncomfortable compared to Dreamliners. Seats were tight and snug.
The food was over salted (yes I know they do that to make the food palatable) to the point it’s inedible.
Service crew were more friendly and pleasant than several previous trips. 
Terrible in flight entertainment.
I was offered the opportunity to bid for PE but I declined as there is no seat guarantee. I had already seat select during ticket purchase and wasn’t going to risk a middle seat at extra cost!",neutral

4016,"Business Class Singapore to Perth Booked a J Class flight back from Singapore to Perth using United Airlines MileagePlus points.  Didn't need to check in as had done it at  Penang.  Spent a few hours at The Jewel after especially coming back through Immigration.  Went through to the BC Lounge and had a snack.  Lounge was quite comfortable although somewhat crowded.  
As the flight was to Australia, final security was at the Departure Gate which gave me a bit of a scare as the Duty Free Lady was late (probably because the gate was changed). She arrived just as final boarding calls were being made.
Flight to Perth was uneventful and reasonably enjoyable.  
Unfortunately the A330 had one of the old seating arrangements and was not a true lie flat but angled so that you continually feel as if you are sliding down to your feet.  At times I found I got better comfort by propping my feet up against the back of the shell of the seat in front (being a shell it is independent of the seat so you don't annoy the passenger in front).  About time that SQ finished their upgrade of the seats or retired the aircraft.  It certainly isn't up to scratch and detracts from the reputation of the airline for quality.",positive

5510,SQ22 Service was very limited despite being 18 hours long. They rushed through the first service since the flight left at 11:30 pm. Then there was no service for another 11 hours.

We had a friends on the flight to Singapore and they also did not place their luggage on the connecting flight to Thailand. Travelled the same route many times before and never had any luggage problems then.",positive

When we are travelling to the far east and Australasia again we will be booking Singapore Airlines again",positive
2973,"Deteriorating airline Singapore Airlines used to rightfully be a favourite when it came to travel. However in recent years it's economy cabin is no competition to other incredible airlines such as Emirates and Qatar. It is easily the most expensive airline in the world while it has been evident through the years that their service and aircraft designs are strongly lacking. Although we flew on a newer aircraft this time, leg room was extremely tight - I couldn't put my chair back in fear that the parent and child in the seat behind would not be able to move or even eat. I just feel their services continue to downgrade, for example, the change of ear pieces for entertainment. SEVERAL years ago they used to offer a decent headset for in-flight entertainment, however now all that you are provided with is cheap earphones that do not even stay in the ear cavity due to poor design. A few years ago we changed our go-to airline to Emirates and within the first flight itself, you will be able to notice immediate upgrades in terms of comfort and overall services.",neutral

“Horror service in Istanbul and Singapore from sg 
Manila, Philippines
To make it short, had a flight with them going from istanbul to manila. On the way back i was denied to enter turkey due to corona virus( foreign passport holder restriction).
I went to the singapore airlines customer service, i was told that I either fly with them back to singapore or get my own ticket departing istanbul. I choosed the option to fly to singapore, booked therefore a connecting flight going to bali.
Short before departure I was handed out my boarding pass, showing that my final destination is manila, not singapore. 
Following this I had an argument with the staff, I was treated very arrogant, felt like I did a violation.
I was told then by another ground staff that she will email her collegues in Singapore so that I possibly can entry. 
Once arrived in Singapore I asked the the sg staff if they received and email or call- none.
The person in charge was even more arrogant denied any effort to help me or at least refund my travel ticket from sg to bali.
Following this I was forwarded to a deportation room, felt like a prisoner there. Was allowed to use my cellphone only for a limited time in a demarqued area. Wasnt allowed to sit during talking even I was deadly tired. 
The story went on until I reached Manila.
In short terms- desastrous communication, arrogant behaviour, chaotic
terrible airline& service, never again!",negative
4576,"CTN VIA JHB TO CHANGI INT Airport, SINGAPORE The flight was on time, and all expectations were met. From inflight entertainment to inflight service. Food choices was okay. Friendly staff. Bathrooms/Toilets are okay, not the greatest.

So tired... one stop in Singapore, another one in Sydney (apparently its not a direct one as SQ advertise!) spending 15 hrs door to door.... 😫 avoid. Get other alternative airlines/different route.",neutral
8689,"Disappointing Service I travelled on SIA flight to Santiago via Sydney on my birthday  and apparently my husband called the SIA office before our flight to ask if he can arrange for the crew to present me a cake as a surprise. He was told it can be done. However, the event did not materialise. Instead, when we had our connecting flight on Latam where he did not inform them of my birthday, the crew surprised her by wishing her happy birthday. I am really disappointed as if it cannot be done, the office should not have promised my husband.",negative

Singapore Airlines has always been a great airlines, but it is even better today.
The flight back was equally as good and I didn't sleep at all.  Too many new movie releases to see.",positive
1392,"The worst first class experience We flew Singapore to London in first class on 24 March We fully appreciate the cv9 impact however the cabin crew were great and did their best. It was however a very disappointing experience in comparison to other major airlines. Given their reputation we were expecting a fantastic flight and some real pampering. The cutbacks in terms of the extras that make the high cost of first class worth while was very evident. No pre take off drinks, food choice was limited and tasted abysmal, no pyjamas or amenity kit etc. This was put down to Cv9 however the cabin crew when pressed as I could not get the reasoning for this did say that it was now the company standard.  As a side note our outbound flight with Singapore airlines was ok however don’t expect champagne or any alcohol as a pre take off drink the crew told us that because of the tax at Heathrow they were no longer offering this....... Our advice don't waste your money choose another airline they cost less and offer a lot more.",negative

2636,"Excellent Airline ! Excellent Service ! Excellent Food on the Flight ! Excellent Airline ! Excellent Service ! Excellent Food on the Flight !

We flew LAX-NRT ( Tokyo Narita ), NRT-SIN & SIN-HYD, w/ a Break of Journey of 5 days at Tokyo, for a Vacation.

The Air Hostesses worked VERY HARD & Tirelessly to keep everyone Satisfied ! Even after working 3-4 hrs on their Shift, they Looked Fresh still !
Couldn't be Happier about everything :-) :-)

MINUS : As we did NOT want Paid Seats, we were Forced to Book our Seat Numbers 48 hrs BEFORE Each Flight. That was DIFFICULT in Tokyo, as we stayed there 5 Days.

MINUS : On the Return, The HYD-SIN Flight was 2.5 Hrs LATE, & would miss the Onward Connection from SIN-LAX. So, they Re-booked Us onto Cathay Pacific at HYD itself. LOTS of DELAY getting that done, at HYD Airport.",positive

The flights were on time, the service was really good right from checking in to the in flight service, no room to complain. The food served was good too, being vegetarian causes problems on some flights but not with Singapore Airlines.The seats were comfortable and the in flight entertainment was decent. Will definitely recommend travelling by Singapore Airlines. Additionally, they had an offer running and we received 20 SGD vouchers to shop at Changi Airport, it was a cherry on the cake.",positive
255,"Lack of customer support and organisation. Originally booked a flight through Singapore airlines for my mother in law to fly from Melbourne to Frankfurt, several hours before her departure the Singapore to Frankfurt flight got cancelled. I spent a couple of hours on the phone talking to both Lufthansa and Singapore airlines to organise the re-booking of her flight, i was bounced back and forth between the two trying to organise it before she had to check in from Melbourne.

The calls took so long i made it to Melbourne airport and instead talked to the service desk and asked about the cancellation and they said it will sorted by the time she arrived in Singapore. Her direct flight got switched out for a Singapore -> Delhi -> Amsterdam -> Frankfurt.

After receiving the email of the change only half an hour before her landing at Singapore i tried to talk to Singapore airlines to her a replacement direct flight as due to medical and language barriers she would not be able to navigate the multiple stopovers.

Two hours on the phone got me nowhere and apparently every flight was booked for the destinations from Singapore to either Munich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, London or even back to Melbourne at which point a family member would be able to her get to her original destination without the insane amount of stopovers.

The staff just kept insisting there is no available flights even for the day after her arrival in Singapore.",negative
7796,Singapore Premium Economy Our first flight in Premium Economy. It was an excellent experience. The seats were comfortable and commodious and the service was excellent. Highly recommend the experience.,positive
3661,"Disappointing quality of aeroplane We flew back from Singapore on a night flight. We were in premium economy and were expecting a good quality plane, however the plane was horrible. The aisles were very narrow, which made it very difficult to move around to the toilet. The seats did not recline at all (3 of our 4 seats didn't recline). When we pointed this out to the air stewardess she tried to push it back by putting all her body weight on it and the person behind pulled it and it moved about 1 inch, and then she gave up and said it's quite tricky. The handset for the TV was broken and my son's laptray was broken. It made us wonder what else on the plane was broken.  There were only 4 toilets for everyone in economy and premium economy to use. At one point we had to wait 20 minutes to use a toilet, which for someone with medical issues is unacceptable. (& Made me very distressed)
Some of the flight staff were very polite, however others seemed brusque and irritable. We were looking forward to the flight as the plane on the way to Singapore felt luxurious, but this plane was awful and should only be used if people are told it's an old plane and the seats are much cheaper. We were very disappointed. I would not fly with Singapore airlines again if they continue to use broken and old planes.
The only reason I gave 3 stars and not just one is because the flight to Singapore was on a bigger newer plane and so was much better.",neutral

622,"The bucket list way to travel As an expat living in Australia for this last 30 years, my wife and I have travelled this route a number of times (as well as many other destinations on business and pleasure). However, we treated ourselves to business class this time, and must say that we were made to feel like royalty.

Aside from all the usual trimmings of business class flights (lounge access, express security and boarding), the check-in staff and airline crew were absolutely marvellous and constantly looked after us. Our comfort and wellbeing was clearly their priority. The preselected three-course meals were on par with a first-rate restaurant, and they had a great choice of top shelf spirits and cocktails (which needless to say we sampled a great many).

Furthermore, I left my iPad on the final return leg (I blame the 16yo single malt scotch 😊) and was contacted by their cleaning contractor (dnata) on the day of my return to say it was found. Excellent service all round. The only major drawback, is that it is now going to be very difficult to ever do that trip again on economy (as we usually do), now that we’ve tasted this 😁

Highly recommended!",positive
8651,"Tiring trip to Tokyo I have mostly had good experiences with Singapore Airlines. 
But recently I had to make a trip from Singapore to Tokyo
on Singapore Airlines, which was really bad.
The flight left Singapore Changi airport at midnight. 
Normally they serve one round of beverages, followed by a meal,
followed by another round of beverages.
This time, they served around half an ounce of Ginger Ale in a glass, which was around all that they served during the entire flight! 
(I looked around me and found that other passengers were being served
similar minuscule quantities too.) Maybe the cabin crew were in a bad mood that day...
I don't know....
Instead of ""Dinner"" they had a ""Refreshment"" which was a freezing cold
Kati Roll type thing which was around the size of a Mars Bar!
(I was being Polite by writing  ""Mars Bar""  since it would be rude to write
what it Actually resembled, in a public forum like this.) 
Most of us would have preferred to have just gone to sleep, with the lights off,
rather than be kept awake for around two hours, just to eat this unpalatable dish.
The flight lasted seven hours and they started to serve breakfast, which wasn't
great either, when turbulence started and they didn't serve coffee or tea at all.
I had heard of some flight where the passengers seated  in economy and the ones 
in business class get the Same meal....but the difference would be, that the people in economy would have to eat whenever the cabin crew served the food, while those in business class could choose when to have their meal!  During this flight, I really wondered what would be the fare served in business class.
On another note, the facilities at Singapore's Changi airport are Fantastic!
When we scan our passport, the machine prints out our boarding pass, after which we just drop our suitcase on a conveyor belt at the check in counter and the suitcase is just whisked away!
The food options at Changi are really nice too.
My experience with The Coffee Bean And Tea Leaf in India has been mostly not all that great. But All their outlets that I have been to in Singapore have been Fantastic, including the one at Changi aiport. Be it their pizza, hot chocolate or cheesecake, the standards maintained are uniformly high.
Thanks to this joint and a really nice Sushi place at Changi, my Singapore/Tokyo flight became significantly less unpleasant. Thank you, Changi.",neutral
5357,"Great service and comfortable flight We flew out of Brisbane on the 11.50pm flight landing in Singapore in the early hours of the morning with a 5 hour layover before our connecting Scoot flight to krabi. 
The flight was full but fairly comfortable although there isn’t a lot of legroom! We had an aisle and middle seat in the middle row which works for me as I like to get up and move around without disturbing or having to climb over people. The seats did have foot rests which was a bonus. The food was ok but not memorable. The flight attendants were polite and efficient and the entertainment selection was ok but I do prefer Emirates/Qantas inflight entertainment. The short connecting flight to Krabi was pretty good considering...the meal provided was very very average and in my case inedible although we did enjoy the Cornflake chocolate!",positive

485,"Last flight home of the holidays. Excellent service. This was our last leg of our flights home to Brisbane. 
We had a 12hr layover in Singapore Changai due to the connecting flight out JFK NY being 3hrs late and Singapore airlines rebooking us due to this. 
They emailed us the morning before the flight to let us know. Noy good having a 12hr layover but they did there best to get us a connecting flight which is good.
The flight left a few minutes late as they didn't open the lounge / gate until 40mins before the flight and everyone had to be screened to get through to the gate. We got off about ten minutes late but this was made up in the flight so we landed on time.
We were allocated seats 58A&B and were one of the last groups to board. It was a full flight but we still had some space for our bags above us in the overhead luggage bins. We had someone next to us so we couldn't spread out.
The crew were excellent and served the meal after taking off. After the meal, the lights were dimmed and I then accessed the excellent inflight entertainment system and watched some movies on it.
The staff were on the ball and were constantly bring water and juice around for the whole flight.
The only downside to the flight were some inconsiderate people sitting in front of us and putting seats back when you were trying to eat. The crew were excellent and pulled them up on this. Some people just need to be more aware of what they are doing and respect other passengers. 
Overall, the flight was good with little turbulence only.
I love flying Singapore airlines as the planes are clean and well serviced, the crew is fantastic, always polite and courteous and ensure the comfort of there guests.
this was highlighted by the flight stewardesses cuddling a baby when the mum was trying to get ready to get off the plane. The genuine care you could see from the staff was excellent. I cant recommend Singapore Airlines enough.",positive

It's hard to complain when seated in business class, however the small foot well is awkward when trying to sleep.

439,"Excellent, Except for the Scoot Leg of the Trip Imagine paying for a fine meal at a 5-star restaurant: A perfectly cooked Rib-eye steak and fine wine as a 5-piece string band quietly plays classical music.  Then, for dessert, pastry from a vending machine.  That's how we felt.

Six of the seven legs of our round-trip to Philippines were on SIA aircraft.  Nice meals/snacks/beverages, in-seat entertainment--even on their smaller planes. One leg was on their low-cost partner, Scoot (the Spirit Airlines of Asia).  It's OK for what it is--The staff was extremely friendly, and we felt safe on their aircraft.,, But we paid for SAI.

The Scoot leg aside, we had a wonderful experience. The meals, even in Economy, are top-notch. The seats were comfortable, in-flight entertainment was excellent and we can't say enough good things about the flight attendants and gate staff.  SIA will be our 1st choice on future trips to Asia, provided there is no Scoot-operated leg.",positive
1237,Don’t choose extra legroom if you would to stretch out and sleep I was mislead on my choice of seat in economy using SeatGuru because I chose a seat immediately behind one of the bulkheads in Economy (A41) which was described as a preferential seat because of the extra legroom. However this was not the most comfortable row in which to travel. On the 13-hour Singapore airlines flight I was on in August 2021 there were only about 16 travellers in economy so every traveller had three seats. This meant that all the other travellers could lift up the movable armrests and stretch out and sleep on three seats; however I could not do that because the armrests on the seats immediately behind the bulkheads are fixed and do not lift up. Those ones with the so-called extra legroom are no longer preferential.,positive

2135,"Great Service but Average Business Class Offering My wife and I travelled to Phuket Thailand via Singapore in November 2019 in business class on Singapore Airlines. The check in process was seamless and our bags were checked all the way to Phuket. Upon check-in we were advised we can use the Singapore Airlines Lounge in Sydney International Airport. The Lounge has is located on the Eastern Part of the Terminal and has a great view of the long runway, the service in the Lounge was good but my wife had to wait at the buffet for staff to replenish the scrambled eggs. The staff were very professional and cleaned the tables frequently.

We travelled on the B777-300 Aircraft and the business class seats are bit tired on this aircraft and also the seat when it is in flat position you have lay on an angle, if you like to watch TV. It did gave me a sore back and I had to get up an go for a walk every hour, which is not a bad thing on a long flight. The crew were very courteous and had attention to details. The service was faultless and the crew met every need in flight. When it came to make the bed, the crew had to help us as this is different to the seats on Qantas or Emirates, where you can make the bed by push of a button, where the Singapore Airline seats is manual click and the back folds into a bed. Which was new to us. 

Once we arrived in Singapore we changed the Terminal and our next flight on Silk Air was also good experience. We used the Lounge in Singapore and it was nice, the food was good and service was good, Lounge was clean and plenty of seating and the atmosphere was really great.  Our flight was at dinner time and I had dinner on Silk Air and their meal service was exceptional. 

On our way back, we travelled on A380 and the seats are newer but it is the same uncomfortable seats when in a bed position, I think Singapore Airlines should really listen to the customers and do something about the seats. As Business class is a major reason why we travelled in Business class, so we can rest and get some sleep on the long flights. I would definitely will travel with Singapore Airlines again but maybe not in Business Class.

Positive: Service, Lounges, Food
Negative: Angle seat when it is in a bed position, uncomfortable",positive
1210,"My 16 year old son was stranded at LAX I always used to think that Singapore Airlines was a good airline until today. Even after submitting proof that one of their agents clearly stated that they would accept a PCR test 72 hours prior to Mt son's flight time, when my son checked in at LAX, the staff refused to let him board. 

They gave him a map and told him he had to get a new PCR test which meant he had to jump on a shuttle alone and find the testing station. He was charged $199 for a PCR test with a 45 minute guarantee. This is an insane amount of money! 

He then rushed back to LAX only to be told he was too late to catch the flight. They refused to issue him a boarding pass even though there was still 35 minutes to spare and he had no bags to check in. 

They did offer to rebook him on snap alternative flight which meant he would have to spend 14+ hours in the airport. Then he was told that he had to get a guardian to sign a permission form because he was under 18 and traveling alone. 

There was no humanity in the way staff dealt with this situation. Sll they cared about was following insane rules which ultimately made no sense since my son was only going to transit through Singapore en route to Jakarta. 

The fact that he submitted a voice memo of a staff member clearly stating he could definitely transit through Singapore with a PCR test taken 72 hours pretty flight made absolutely no difference to Singapore Airlines' staff. We believed that this woman had told us the truth, but ultimately my son paid the price as did I. The incredible stress and anxiety caused by Singapore Airlines policies and unwillingness to acknowledge this staff's recording as clear proof, has not only cost me financially, but emotionally and mentally. My son had to go through an ordeal which was incredibly stressful and challenging on all levels. 

Afterwards, I contacted Singapore Airlines asking for compensation. Several staff promised to get back to me but they never did. 3 phone calls later, I was told by Lloyd, a supervisor based in the Philippines, that Singapore Airlines would not compensate me. There was no accountability from SIA for their egregious mistake.

It's for these reasons and more, that my family nor I will never fly on Singapore airlines again.",negative
6226,"Stingy Rich Asians-lah We booked award travel tickets using Kris Flyer miles. Afterward we realized there was another flight available for award travel which would be a better fit for our schedule. Within an hour of original booking, we called Singapore Airlines to request that we change the booking to the more convenient flight. Even though only a short time had elapsed, the airline demanded $50 per person change fee. We asked for a supervisor to reconsider, but the supervisor also refused to waive the change fee.
This  airline offers a good in-flight product, on par with regional rivals EVA and Cathay Pacific. However, when it comes t extracting fees from travelers, they are just as smarmy as any other carrier. Be careful here, if you make a mistake you will pay for it. Lah!",negative

Well that was easily done but the only problem was that they would charge me for business and not refund any of the money that I had already paid for the cattle class seat. It wasn't like it was a couple of days before the flight but quite some time. The flights were very good and the new aircraft were fantastic. One thing that I did notice on investigation that all the flights were full, meaning that they had been paid for one seat twice. Not a bad scam. 
A couple of weeks before, I had flown business on Philllipine Airlines. The service was just as good and the food was just a bit better. You know that when they bring the food trolley around on Singapore the smell is always the same and turns you off.

Boarding was right on time but once in the plane it took a  very long time before take off, didn’t get food or drinks in te meantime. Thats where it went wrong.  Although we did have a very good lunch my husband got problems with his diabetes. We managed to get some  coca cola to get his sugar level   very quickly right again. During the rest of the  flight they kept asking if he was OK or needed more foor or drinks. After he had the coca cola he was fine again. Although we always carry grape-sugar tablets, coca cola is the fastest thing to give to a diabetic in trouble. Staff was very thoughtfull after that incident.",positive

1304,"Dreadful customer service. My husband and I were to fly home from Houston on March 24 2020. The flights were ancelled because of Corona virus. We were notified 3 times of replacement flights only to have ach one cancelled literally at the last minute. We appreciate the problems at that time but when we tried to contact the airline we got a standard letter about how busy they were etc and would reply within 3 days. Of four or five emails we sent to them, we still have not had a reply to any one of them. Eventually we booked with American Airlines Houston to Dallas, Dallas to Heathrow, Heathrow to Manchester on May 10. The day before we were to fly the Heathrow to Manchester flight was cancelled so we got a train from Manchester.Trying to get a refund from Singapore Airlines for not using the return half of our tickets has been an example of dreadful customer service. We were obviously naive in thinking we should get half the return fare back each which would have been £240 each. The airline is giving us about half of that each, saying they have charged us for Manchester Airport taxes for landing and leaving and for other ""taxes"". We did not fly home with Singapore Airlines and we did not fly Heathrow to Manchester as the flight was cancelled. Trying to get an explanation of this has been impossible. We have not yet received any refund. We had also booked and paid for the same return trip to fly in September, these flights have now been cancelled but the promised e-mails to inform us of our options re moving the booking to next year or getting a refund have not yet turned up. Despite a flurry of emails from us to the airline to try and get this resolved we have been unsuccessful and have yet to see any refund. This is very sad as the planes, cabin staff, facilities such as comfort, food and entertainment are excellent and the route is very convenient for the UK to the USA.

During the flight, the man in front of us was very aggressive for some reason and kept on reclining his chair and rocking it to annoy my wife who was sitting behind him. As my wife preferred an aisle seat, we asked if they flight attendants could speak to the man or switch my wife's seat with someone. They attendants said that because the man was so aggressive, there was nothing they could do. So I gave my wife the middle seat instead and which made her feel claustrophobic. I asked the attendants again if they could switch her seat but because it was a fully booked flight, there was nothing that they could do. I am quite disappointed with Singapore Air because we had heard such great reviews about their service.

I accept that UK time was 8 hours behind so we left at equivalent of 02:00hrs but the lights were still dimmed 30 mins before we landed at 15:30hrs. Within an hour of landing it was dark again!  We had over 24 hours without daylight. Surely they should have raised the lights when UK time reached noon.

Because there is 12 hours between flights you can have a decent sleep in the Transit Hotel in Terminal 3 without leaving the airport.

9930,"New SQ Boeing 787-10 SQ started using their new Boeing 787-10 for one of their flights between Manila and Singapore and I was lucky enough to be on that flight which is the early morning flight to Singapore. I find it great how SQ has boarding sequence, makes boarding the plane less chaotic. On boarding the plane you are greeted nicely by the FA's and shown your seat (if they are not helping another passenger already). Before taking off they provide hot towels, it's a nice touch! 

The plane is new and beautiful outside and inside. I like the electronic window darkening. I'm a tall guy and I find the legroom to be good enough (Economy). The plane has a 3-3-3 configuration, but all the way at the back of the plane at row 74 and 75 there's 2 lovely seats for couples, so no third person in that row. I was not lucky enough to get it for me and my girlfriend (on return to Manila I managed to reserve it). 

This was an early morning flight. I had fish for breakfast and it was good, but I felt like something was missing from the meal, maybe yogurt would have been nice. The IFE is great, the new displays are bigger. I managed to watch a film before the plane landed in Singapore.

7036,"Attentive Cabin Crew My wife and I were on our way home from a 6 week cruising vacation to Indonesia and Australia.  We now find that we need to have Mobility Assistance when we travel and we were looked after very well from check in to the lounge.  Whilst the food was not particularly to our liking in the lounge it did not bother us too much.  At an appropriate time we were collected and wheeled to the A380 aircraft departure gate and onto the aircraft; all this went very smoothly and we were welcomed aboard and looked after.
The seat arrangements vary so much on different airlines, especially when the seats are converted to beds and this is where I had a problem.  The 'cubby hole' where my feet would reside when laying down was too small for me so was a little uncomfortable but suited my wife very well.  It is a long flight and food and entertainment was very acceptable, but that is what I have come to expect from this airline.

Firstly the Changi airport experience is very good. Other airports could learn a lot from them.

Boarding is easy.

My first complaint is that they have removed footrests?? On a long flight they are necessary, and because they were there on last flight I didn’t take my portable one.

This was a full flight in the a380. In March this exact same flight was a pleasure, the reason we paid the SIA, price.
So why the changes? 

Lights out for most of the flight?
Only two meals in 141/2 hours!

Crew little in evidence.

8750,"Singapore Airlines-definitely a cut above mediocre flight experience. My son and I flew to Nepal and back with Singapore Airlines. They are definitely set highly apart and a cut above the mediocre flight experiences that are now rife in this industry. I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this day and age there was still an airline carrier that gave so much baggage allowance at no extra cost. I was even more delighted with the efficiency of of their services from checking in -with no need to arrive ridiculously early at the airport, to prompt departures and early arrivals.
In flight we were well fed with plenty of snacks and meals that seemed to keep coming so much so I even opted out from having some and not to mention how generously they attended to with us with refreshments, all for no extra costs!!! This generous free service surely defines the true meaning of hospitality and it took me back to my younger days, to the positive experiences I enjoyed about flying. We also got nicely bagged packs with not just socks but toiletries as well and there was plenty more extra individually packed supplies in their bathrooms. Impressively the cleanliness of their bathrooms was meticulously maintained throughout the entire flight, that was pleasant indeed and made me relax when my son went to the toilet, knowing it was hygenically safe. 
Though I was in economy I seemed to have plenty leg room to relax and had a foot rest to angle myself comfortably. The inflight information and entertainment was vast and I enjoyed so many movies and so did my son. He even had games to play also.

So we decided to keep to our 6pm flight and to our dismay when we wanted to board at 5pm ; our 6pm flight was delayed for one hour.

Our luggage was booked through from Zadar but Singapore airlines could not locate it when we finally got our boarding passes.  We were told to check before boarding.  Staff still could not locate our luggage and told us to check with ground staff in Singapore.  No toiletry bags were given on the flight and normally this would not be a concern however had we not received our bags some toiletries would have been helpful.  Our bags were located  once we landed.  The food was as bad as you would get in economy.  Had two mouthfuls,  that was enough.  Just slapped on a plate instead of a tray. Pretty poor.",neutral

9684,"Never again I had 2 Business Class flights with Singapore over the past month.  Both were unsatisfactory.  Firstly I could not operate lay flat seats.  I had to get out of the seat, ask the flight attendant to lay the seat flat then get back flat into it.  In order to get legs strait had to lay at an angle of 45 degrees as could not get them under seat in front.  When I wanted to sit up had to again get out of the seat and ask attendant to manage it.  The entertainment system was primitive.  Operated was by a handset attached by a wire.  No touch screen.  Had to ask attendant to operate it.  She said other passengers also had trouble operating it!  No late release movies and very limited and unsatisfactory selection of music. Meals were of a poor standard and badly timed. I was offered either French or Australian white wine without knowing what winery.  The crews were lazy.  I have travelled Business Class on a variety of other airlines in the last few years and this one is easily the worst.",negative

8650,"I expected more In general, SQ's service has always been good. Trusted by my family since the 80s. As much as I would like to support local, I would only take SQ if the price is right. There was a deal for this trip to HK that made flying with SQ more desirable than taking budget.

The seats felt awkward for me. I am 1.58m but I felt that that the table was too low for me. 

There was only noodles left by the time the service staff came to me & unfortunately part of the noddles was hard. So I only ate half of it. To my surprise, the coffee cup that came with my tray of food was broken. 

I was still eating the hot dish when the air stewardess was came around with ice cream. So I told her, ""Maybe later."" Without prompting, she came back after my meal to ask if wanted my ice cream now.

2767,"She just needs to behave herself “Well, she just needs to behave herself” are words that should never be uttered to a parent concerned with their child’s safety. 

l’m usually very happy with SQ, on particular trip however, I was up to a boiling point. I was traveling with my 2 year old, we’ve had no issues traveling on business class with them in past on this route and are familiar with the type of aircraft they use as well as the type of seats. 

On this flight, they decided to change to an aircraft meant for longer haul (I usually get this aircraft when I fly to Tokyo, for example).This means that we have the cubicle type seats and I would not be able to reach or help my child should the situation arise. Every parent’s nightmare.

On ANA, the cabin crew will usually ask me to keep her on my lap on take off and landing, for safety reasons. What 2 year old can be expected to sit still for that amount of time. So, I thought to ask if I can do the same on SQ and the answer was no. Look, I understand that this is airline safety policy but what the crew said really angered me.
He said, “well, she just has to behave herself”. This just rude and unacceptable hospitality. 

I never write reviews like this, but this event was too upsetting not to share.",negative
1360,"Excellent service, especially good for the disabled We’d flown to Singapore on Thai Airways, but decided to use Singapore Airline for the return, to avoid a long wait in Bangkok (Thai cancelled a good connecting flight).  We were much happier with the precautions against Covid-19 in Singapore compared to Thailand.
The flight was very comfortable, and we had adequate space in our seats.  There was plenty of TV entertainment, but the earphones were cheap and nasty (not as good as on Thai).  There were adequate toilets, and we didn’t have to queue for more than a minute or two.  I do wish airlines would state the number of passengers per toilet.  I’m disabled and this is very important for me.  When I checked the seating plan, I thought there were inadequate toilets, but there were more toilets than the seating plan showed!
Toilets and the whole plane were very clean throughout the trip.  It was a night flight, and we were offered drinks when we were awake on many occasions.  The food was tasty, with a choice of Western or Eastern meals.  The plane was modern.
After using Thai Airways, I was very impressed with the standard of care I received as a disabled person.  We were greeted when we entered the plane, and escorted to our seats, the stewardess carried our cabin baggage for us, and stowed it in the overhead locker.
Before landing, she came to our seats and explained the procedure (we stay seated until other passengers have left the plane).  She then came when the plane had emptied, collected our baggage and escorted us to the exit.
We’ve flown with Singapore Airlines repeatedly, and once again felt we had an excellent flight.",positive
6614,"Why SIA is Rated #1 Beginning in 1977, we have traveled extensively with SIA. Our experience is always superb but on this recent flight, we must relay our utmost delight in the services of our cabin crew. While all flights have offered impeccable food and beverage service, this group of attendants were most courteous and friendly. We realize that it is a difficult task to serve many disparate needs over the course of many hours while maintaining a demeanor of grace, elegance and charm along with comfort and understanding. Our cabin crew completely fulfilled this role and deserve, in our opinion, to be individually recognized for their excellent performance.

We are in Rome organising to return shortly to Australia. 
We have 2 choices - to spend the remaining 2 of weeks in Rome or go to Germany for 2 weeks.
So I did some research on airfares. 
Checked online with Singapore Airlines:
Rome - Frankfurt - Singapore 945.00 Euro
Frankfurt - Singapore 2700 Euro.
That cannot be right!! 3 times more for less??!! 
The Frankfurt - Singapore was the same flight on the same day in both examples - 26 March flight SQ325, so I rang Singapore Airlines. 
After much discussion with the operator without a suitable explanation, other than ""that is what is in the system"", I asked to speak to a supervisor as it didn't make sense.
The supervisor said the pricing was correct as they have different pricing schedules for different markets. Italians wont pay as much as the Germans.
I said ""Can I buy a Rome - Frankfurt - Singapore ticket and only use the Frankfurt - Singapore leg?""
No! the ticket is void if I don't get on in Rome.
Checked with Lufthansa (Germany's own airline) and the same result. 
Talk about ripping off your customers!!

1507,"Disappointed with our Experience We have just returned from our first flights with Singapore. We were very much looking forward to flying with them in view of their recent number 1 rating. However, the service did not meet our expectations. The food was very good, and the cabin crew were really nice, but on both flights we found them to be very disorganised. On our way from UK to Singapore, the first meal came around, and we were asked what we wanted to drink, and both nominated G&T, and the reply was ""That will take some time"", and she explained they only carried wine with the food and we could have a G&T after all the meals were served. To be fair, we didn't wait long as we were the last to be served. On the way back, the crew were really confused, we had two trolleys serving , and both missed us, they were withdrawing when I pointed out we had no meals. Then they got the drinks wrong, and then the other crew delivered some more, which were different, it was a bit shambolic.
However, that was all a bit of human error, and as I said, they were very nice, but the real issue is the entertainment.  They were THE most rubbish selection of films we have ever experienced. They had what I would describe as two or three quality films, and the rest were awful. When we fly with Virgin, I watch good film after good film, but on this 14 hour flight, I watched one new film, and another B or C list  unknown, and that was it, the rest were unwatchable.",neutral

Since it was a late flight, the lights went out and we hardly saw a crew member for another 10 hours. They set up a snack area in the galley if you geot hungry.

2174,"Boeing 777-300ER Old Aircraft! In our recent trip to Tokyo, we were flying with Singapore Airlines again and it was an old Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft (I will discuss that shortly).

While check-in was smooth in Changi Airport, the flight was delayed due to the ""late arrival of the aircraft"". It was delayed by 30mins. But somehow we managed to touch down in Haneda Airport just with a mere 5 mins delay, and the pilots did a great job. Both taking off and landing were perfect and so smooth and you won't actually feel anything. Kudos to the team!

Next, the aircraft was old though it was supposed to be a retrofitted version. Seat was generally ok as we sat in the ""forward section"". 

The in-flight system was old, slow and kept hanging from time to time. Remote was also insensitive and the flight path display was ""2D"" and look dated. The contents were somehow quite limited too.

As for the food, it was average but not hot when served.

The crew were friendly, attentive and did a great job, walking around constantly to serve drinks and clear the used cups etc.

Overall, the flight was satisfactory though can be better.

Return flight:

On our return flight to Singapore, it was an airbus A330-300, it was a better and newer aircraft as compared to the boeing 777. Seat and legroom were fine and inflight was better than the boeing 777 though can be better. The flight left on time from Haneda.

And again the pilots did a marvelous job, smooth took off and landing and in fact arrived at Changi about 20mins ahead of schedule!

As for the food, there was no choice as the more popular item ""Japanese set"" were all given out and many had to accept the other only option. I noticed some passengers didn't take but requested for instant noodles (either they didn't eat spicy food or pork). Food was average but the ice cream was yummy!

Cabin crew was overall friendly and attentive and polite (especially the Japanese crew who kept apologizing and thanking to accept the only other set meal). But the leading stewardess was not too friendly and when we asked about the collection of our purchased item (we did the order online) when announcement that Krisshop was available, she seemed impatient somehow and responded ""wait for my colleagues to finish their work first"" and walked off. Perhaps she had a bad day or being frustrated with some other passengers?

Hmm, is that the ""right"" or ""political correct"" answer? She could be more tactful and told us that her colleagues would follow up in a while after they had finished with whatever they were doing.

But the crew who later brought us the item was friendly and smileful though.

In both of these flights, there were ""hits and misses"" in the inflight system, seat, food and cabin crew service. But as for the pilots, they were doing a great job for these 2 flights and credit and compliments must be given to them!

I hope SIA will seek to improve and not being complacent and taking their passengers for granted, and if not, they will soon be overtaken again by other leading airlines!",neutral

4119,"Poor check-in and boarding logistics and service My trip had the following legs: OSL-CPH-SIN-AKL

In OSL there was a long struggle getting around the mandatory visa requirement in the system, which is incorrect, as Norwegians do not require visa to NZ. After some phone calls problem was seemingly resolved, and I was checked-in.

In CPH I was called at the gate where a long and tedious processing and questioning ensued as there was an issue with visa - again. They were unwilling to disclose what the problem was, but asked and acted like they tried to solve a new type of problem. After much tos-and-fros I was allowed onboard the SIN flight.

In SIN there was not much time between flights, but I made it just in time for boarding only to be denied entry as I did not have a visa. Again - not required. After some discussion the visa track was directed to flight/PNR out of NZ. This flight was never brought up in OSL or in CPH, if it had I would have been able to sort that out well before SIN boarding, and that is also the requirement of Singapore airlines to ensure all requirments of a traveller are met at the beginning of the PNR, meaning that boarding at first flight meets all requirements throught to the end destination. Instead my boarding processes were halted with a system malfuntion requiring a NZ visa.

As my NZ flight was booked separately by my travel partner, I had to get that from him. Problem was that he was on a different flight. There was no help from any of the staff in any manner whatsoever, and they did not accept responsibility for this requirement not being communicated to me in OSL or CPH. The only thing that was communicated to me throughout was the errouneous visa requirement.
Fortunately my partner had just landed in AKL and thus I got my out-of-NZ PNR and was allowed boarding as one of the last passengers..

He could also inform me that he was not asked for a return ticket out of NZ anywhere on his trip and entered AKL without having showed it to anyone - so this is quite disturbing. No best practices, no adherence to regulations, simply very random.

That said the CPH-SIN flight was excellent. Excellent food. Excellent staff. Wide flatbed seat, but it would be nice with a mattress.",positive

Over the last decade we have regularly flown with Singapore Airlines (SA) and have found them to be really good. Well, it seems things  have really changed and not for the better.  SA are now running Airbus 350s on the SQ241 route which have very reduced leg room in economy ( 18"").

Firstly, the seats were not as comfortable as Emirates. Secondly, the plane was a bit grubby. The toilets from the beginning heavily smelt or urine, which wasn't nice. Staff were fairly welcoming, but not massively. We both ordered a non fish meal. Our flight from Heathrow to Singapore meal was OK, but because special meals are served first it means you have to wait a long while for your drink. Our meal for our flight from Singapore to Bali was not good. The roll was not edible, and the rest of the meal was not very nice. We felt penalised for ordering a special meal, as other passengers received a Magnum, when we asked we were told we didn't have one as had a special meal. In fairness the air stewardess did give us a Magnum, although slightly begrudgingly! I have raised a complaint with SA, to which they have replied and are investigating. We're hoping our flight home is better. I wonder whether glowing reviews are from those that travel Business or First.

7789,"Brisbane to Singapore and return Have recently flown to Singapore and then on to Hong Kong to join a cruise back to Singapore,usually when flying to Europe I fly economy to Singapore then on to Europe Buisness . this time as was only to Singapore then on to Hong Kong and back by Ship I chose to do Premium Economy both ways and was not disappointed in any way .
The seats are comfortable and sufficient leg room and only having 3 rows in the cabin made it feel like your own private plane .and the in flight service could not be faulted including noise reduction head sets . 
Will definitely do Singapore Airlines Premium Economy from now on.",positive
2530,"Hassle free travelling making long haul no problem! I cannot praise the flight attendants enough working for this airline. Despite the length of flight, at no time was anything too much trouble. 

They ensured that refreshments arrived at regular intervals and the service was speedy, efficient and polite.

The standard of food served was pleasing and hot, and the range of drinks included was very much appreciated.

The only downside to my review is that I managed to get the last seat on this plane and was charged double the price which I found to be very unfair.",positive
9095,"Best short break ever I have reviewed my hotel separately but the whole trip was enhanced tremendously by the service given by the staff of Singapore airways.  Automatic check in was straight forward and help was in any case available. Boarding was well organised and speedy. The cabin crew were terrific  (and the ladies beautiful). We were definately not treated as second class flyers despite being in economy. The meals were excellent and where appropriate, very hot. Drinks of all kinds were readily available. The entertainment was wide ranging and up to date.  On our outward journey I watched 3 films and listened to two albums. The two journies passed very quickly and relatively comfortably. 
A great experience and probably the best airline I have ever flown with. If able, I shall fly with them again as soon as possible.",positive
1584,Great flight and service We now know why Singapore airlines were voted the best long haul carrier. The certainly live up to their accolade. every thing was perfect from start to finish!,positive
5465,"Travelled with a 2.5 year old for the first time Actually quite comfortable and having own tv was a plus. He didn’t wear his earphones but was able to watch the picture. We had wifi which we could purchase on the flight so he could watch his iPad. They provide a pillow and blanket so no need to bring those extra items to lug around. Drinks and meals obviously provided. Loved the wine :) 
Service is great always smiling and the A380 is a smooth ride. Will definitely fly Singapore again.",positive
632,"Lost baggage Flying home after 3 years to australia to visit family for Christmas and Singapore airlines loose my luggage and leave me with nothing for days.

I’m so appalled and I’m DREADING my flight back to london with them",negative
3829,"Great service friendly staff 😀 First time traveling on Singapore airlines & we very impressed with how professional hard working and friendly they were.

1266,"No quibble refund after we booked direct with airline I have seen so many bad reviews on major airlines as a result of COVID flight cancellations. I can only say that I have nothing but good things to say about Singapore Airlines from our own experience. We spoke with one of their representatives on the phone after they rang us and she was as pleasant and helpful as anyone we have ever spoken too. She processed the return of our ticket costs after they had cancelled 2 of the flights without any fuss whatsoever. We were told that the refunds could take from 2 to 6 weeks before they would be in our bank account, 4 days later we had the full amount refunded. When all this horrible situation is sorted there will only be one airline we will use to make our trip to see the daughter and grandchildren. Good service earns its own rewards.",positive
3581,"Flying SIA We travelled on the A380 to Singapore. The flight was comfortable as it has a bit more leg room than budget airlines. The return flight was not as comfortable as the seat cannot be reclined properly. I provided feedback after my trip but to SIA credit, they responded to me. Their on flight food was ok, not great. I travelled on many airlines before and most do not have good food in economy class unless you are in first class. You get what you pay for which is fair enough",positive

Overall a very good flight with great service from the cabin crew and the pilot got us home back 30 mins earlier than expected 😊. There were no delays at all. 
Good legroom in economy class and a fantastic selection of entertainment on board. Toilets were always clean and they offer complimentary toothbrushwith toothpaste, comb, socks, earphones etc. 
Only disappointment was the food - tasteless in flight meals and not so fresh bread rolls.",positive

6775,"Business trip to Australia Poor/low skilled attendance at the gate. Efficiency during boarding is not optimal and always a struggling between airport crew and early boarding passengers, due too late announcement of the boarding procedure. It's already multiple times I experienced the chaotic scene and that passengers sent back again, due to wrong groupage.
Please repare the gate prior to arrival of the passengers in the hall and show your boarding procedure on a screen or signs! And keeep Priority Class passengers really separated, so people don't think the boarding actual is free entry again. Maybe by announcing in more languages",positive

Great service Singapore Airlines. I look forward to flying with you again.",positive
4786,"Was SO disappointing Robotic cabin crew. REALLY uncomfortable seats for those who have bad necks, head Corder forward so got a headache within hours. Inedible food (Special chef orders just as bad too). Lights off at 3pm, yes 3pm so for 2 flights totalling approx 1 day of flying time, supposed to sleep .. Ummah, hideous for those who don't need hours and hours of sleep. Told to switch my 'night' light off so couldn't read and didn't want to watch any more movies. Return flight packed (This time in ECO as no room in PREM ECO), hot cabin, service stretched ... If you could call it service. I asked to borrow a pen to complete landing card and waited 30+ minutes. Had to ask again. Only thing I asked for in the 4 flights I took. I will NEVER fly this airline again mainly because the crew have zero empathy and the seats are SO UNCOMFORTABLE. If only I'd flown Virgin Atlantic ...",negative

8439,"Amazing.... Four flights with Singapore Air in a month and what can I say...all amazing. 
Flew Economy but everything great and service second to none. 
Changi Airport is amazing...had a layover for just under 4 hours on the way out from London to Melbourne and all shops great. Duty free is delivered to your boarding gate so no need  to carry liquor around whilst there. Picked up my free Changi Airport Dollar Vouchers courtesy of the airline whilst there...Two of us so  $40 SGD worth which we spent on our return trip....valid at most retailers except food and drink outlets.
Only one bar but managed a couple of local Tiger Beers...all good.
Return journey check in fantastic...self check in and all self bag drop...even printed a heavy label for our cases and off they went.
Never crowded  as such a large terminal (Terminal 3)...
Be careful to check boarding gate as can be a long walk. Only one minor thing....you cannot buy water to take on plane as you need to go through security prior to boarding at gate. You can take a water bottle through empty and fill at fountain in waiting area.
My father is elderly and walks with a stick....at all times we were ushered through early even though we were Economy passengers...never waited more than a couple of minutes queuing.
Very attentive at all levels...would highly recommend.
Looking forward to saving for my next trip Down Under and will definitely fly with this airline.",positive
9271,"Flying back home with Singapore airlines the best flying experience with Singapore Airlines 

during the holiday break I bought a 1 way ticket from singapore airlines at their sales office in orchard and had to pay a 50 USD fee/person for the service but it was worth of flying and buying it. I was in luck because the ticket cause 1/2 price from Garuda and I got to fly on a B 777 - 300. and when the day come, we sat on the plane and it was so huge compared to Garuda because its a B 777 - 300. when it took of from the ground the plane went through a strong turbulence when it fly over between the batam and singapore straight.",positive
6003,"Best airline I have ever flown with! I've been on more planes than I can count for both domestic and international flights and I can say this Singapore Airlines trip was without a doubt the best and most comfortable trip I have had.

The most comfortable economy seats with pillows and blankets the entire way.

Friendly staff who will go the extra mile for you make this trip an unforgettable one. I will ALWAYS fly Singapore Airlines when I can from now on!

I felt like I had been dropped into a cheap toy plane.  I'm only 5'7"" and 57kgs but I found the seating very cramped and very uncomfortable. The only good news is that your carry on luggage won't be as miserable as you are because the overhead luggage compartments are huge.  
The flight crew were fabulous but unfortunately, they couldn't make up for the horrible plane.",negative
5122,"Premium Economy? Don't bother.... Saved hard to treat myself to all that Singapore Airlines promised for the Premium Evonomy experience and what did I get - more leg room, yes but I'm short so it wasn't the reason to book this. I was looking for all the extra service they promised and did not experience any difference from economy. The seat was hard, the headrest was broken, the blanket was scratchy and the toilets were not kept clean. Drinks service was invisible and the food was ordinary. Not happy. My advice - save your money!",negative

After flying to the UK earlier in the year with Emirates I have to say Singapore is my favourite airline.",positive
3952,"Smooth experience, on par with Cathay This was my first time flying SG airlines and I thought the service was superb. The seat was huge widthwise and cushy too, and I loved that there was so much space for me to stretch out. However the old seat buttons are hard to manoeuvre and were slow to respond.

I think the food on Cathay tasted better though, and there was definitely a stronger air of luxury & modernity there than the SG airlines plane I was on. Would still recommend the biz class for flyers!",positive
8720,"Perfect flight!!! The best flight I ever had.. steady and calm. Amazing staff, friendly and very helpful all the way through. Good food and beverages, not only at meals but all the way throughout the flight there was water and snacks passing through.

Enjoyed seating by the window. Enjoyed Singapore sling and lamb chops. Mee Siam is ok but needs improvement. Was hoping to book the cook - hainesese chicken rice but heard from friends that it's just average.  I wish to let you all at Singapore airlines know what can be improved for hainesese chicken rice - apparently more flavour?  🙏😃🇸🇬. The SIA lounge at terminal 3 was very good and got a lot of food choices to choose from. 

I would definitely recommend to anyone to try Singapore airlines as it's unique air experience. I have been flying with SIA quite a lot and will still use this airlines at some point in future.",positive
2988,"Singapore flight The flight was good there were no delays quick check in
Some food and drinks are not always available also the meals on the menu are short and you have to take what they have.
Some flight attendant don’t like people coming in the kitchen to ask for snacks",positive
5520,"Pretty good, all things considered Flew back to AKL from SIN and after the flight up with Air NZ we were looking forward to comparing the service back with Singapore Airlines. We were in a B777-300ER which with Singapore's service has the cattle class seats configured in 3-3-3 meaning you have slight wider seats and better aisle room that some airlines which fly the B777 with the 3-4-3 configuration. 

Seats were comfortable and the in-flight entertainment system excellent. Seat recline was too much - the guy on the aisle seat across from me had a real issue with comfort as he was a big fella and had another big guy in front of him who reclined his seat full back, giving my neighbour virtually no personal space. That's probably as much to do with passenger flying etiquette as anything else, but a more restricted seat recline would certainly have helped.

Staff service couldn't be faulted, Meals were OK - So much nicer they at least have you eating with stainless steel utensils, and not the plastic knives and forks used locally - so much better environmentally,

We had a substantial tail wind coming back which was great given we had a tight transit time in Auckland. Much of this time saving was used up however as it took well over 15 minutes from stopping at the terminal to actually leaving the aircraft, as they let the higher paying passengers off first before the many in the back of the aircraft.

It was pretty good service but I still rate their SilkAir regional brand as a better airline.",positive
2070,"3 hours of luxury  My gf and I decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a business class flight from Singapore to Manila in January 2020.
From the minute we walked into the airplane and graciously guided to our own personal business class booths, we knew this flight was going to be our favorite.
We've been on over a hundred airplanes before with numerous airlines around the world, but never in a business class seat with Singapore Airlines.
The courteousy, respect and professionalism the staff showed us was above and beyond anything I've experienced. We were constantly being checked on, our meals were incredible, we had bottomless drinks of our choice, cozy personal reclining seat /bed to relax in, the latest in entertainment on my own wide screen TV monitor and the bathroom was literally 4 feet away!
If you ever feeling like treating yourself or family and /or friends to luxury in the air, do it with Singapore's business class! It's totally worth it!",positive
4360,"Departure lounge a scene from Benny Hill/ or Fawlty Towers In the departure lounge at Sydney it seems to us and other travellers that there was a problem .
One of the younger attendants seemed to be suffering from OCD. She moved and adjusted the chrome posts and the tapes, time after time after time . 
Then minutes later you’ve guessed it she did it all again. She was very good at no eye contact at all.
If Sydney caught this on CCTV it make a great “how not to reassure your passengers”
Boarding staff at Sydney sorry nil points .
We didn’t get a reply when we asked the guestion as to what was going on .",neutral
8810,top class airline this airline certainly knows how to treat people nothing is a problem if you want something just ask and it delivered with a smile.,positive
3232,"What A Disappointment! I was surprised to see the old large -wide seats & no pod. It took a while for me to feel comfortable. Luckily the cabin crew were eager to assist making the bed although I found it difficult to click the seatbelt on when preparing to sleep.
A couple of short bursts of turbulence had no affect on me.
The meal offerings before arrival were poor & gave very little choice..the frittata was ok.
If I fly with this airline again I'll be sure to check flights with pods",neutral
8358,"2nd flight in three weeks...and same disappointment This was my second flight to Singapore in three weeks. Last time, I reported about my check-in issues and the problem with the bed, where my neighbour kept waking me up by knocking on the separation wall....

This time, my first disappointment came when they did not have the right size (L) of the pyjama....how can an airline not take enough pyjamas of each size? If it is a saving measure this is probably the most client-unfriendly measure you can imagine!

The second came with the meal. I took the meat of the signature dish of George Blanc. Well, the meat was so hard that I could not eat it and had to send it back...

It really gives the impression of an airline trying to save in all directions, and it does not provide a great client experience, especially when you pay this price tag.",neutral

7399,"Great service We use Silk Air airlines to Singapore several times for our holiday and its service is never dissapointing. We love the main food provided during our short flight (around 1.5 hour). We also consider the ticket price is acceptable, considering it is included meals and baggage 30 kg. Compared to other budget airlines, we have to do extra pay for those.",positive
7646,"The best Premium Economy Class I ever tried The leg room is more than enough for a 5 hours flight.  Good food, but I think they have cut a bit of cost in the past 1-2 years.  I like the headphone for entertainment, and the individual reading light when I need to focus and read on board.  The reclining seat is one of the most comfortable seats I have tried, I even tried taking Premium Economy on my last trip to Germany from Singapore, 8-9 hours are still manageable, but definitely not as good as flatbeds you get in Business class.  But given the price you paid for this class and the comfort you get, it's still quite a good deal.",positive

8448,"My favourite Airline! Okay so I may be biased ;) But I love Singapore Airlines! They always look beautiful, I love their uniform and the service is to 90% amazing. I only once had a stewardess that was not quite as attentive but still good. The rest of the time (and I've flown with this Airline from Zurich to Singapore, from Singapore to Perth and Sydney to Singapore - so all long flights). The service was always great! Even in Economy you have space. Their food is always yummy and they have Gingerale! <3 If you need anything the crew is always looking out to see if any guest has a request. And if you do have a request they immediately try and fulfill it. I have never had a bad experience on Singapore Airline! They used to give out free kits with Sleeping Mask and tooth paste, etc. Unfortunately you don't get that anymore (at least not with Economy).",positive
421,"Great service for a short flight We flew on Singapore Airlines B787-10 for this flight. The Economy Class cabin is further segregated into two sections, with 150 seats in the forward cabin and 151 in the aft cabin. Singapore Airlines uses three colours: brown, grey, and turquoise, for its Economy Class seats. In addition, the use of mood lighting for different moments of the flight, such as white lighting during boarding and disembarking and purple/orange lighting during the morning flight time, allows passengers to relax during the flight.

There are several lavatories dotted across the two sections of the Economy Class. The lavatory onboard is not exactly the largest, but it is very functional. The mirrors in the lavatory make the space appears larger than it is. The hardworking cabin crews on Singapore Airlines constantly kept the lavatory very clean for the duration of the fight. I like the touch-free features, such as the sensor-activated tap and the toilet flush to the step-activated trash bin cover, which provided convenience to passengers and were extremely important in this endemic period. Singapore Airlines is one of the few airlines worldwide that still provides toothbrushes in their lavatories other than the standard hand soap.

Economy Class seats on Singapore Airlines B787-10 are arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. Each seat has a 32″ seat pitch and measures 17″ wide with a 5″ recline. Despite the very thin-looking Economy Class seats on Singapore Airlines, which do not seem to provide much cushioning, these seats are very comfortable for the short two-hour flight. In addition, the four-way adjustable headrest contributes to the comfort afforded by these Economy Class seats. The controls for reading light control and call attendant buttons are found under the IFE screen. There is also a sizable tray table on every seat. A standalone cup holder is fitted under the IFE screen, allowing passengers to stow their cups of drinks without needing to deploy the tray table. The seat pockets on Singapore Airlines are designed to allow passengers to maximise the usage of these pockets and also make it easier for passengers to locate the items they placed inside the pockets. 

An 11.1″ touchscreen TV is fitted in every Economy Class seat. There are many entertainment options on Singapore Airlines’ KrisWorld, ranging from the latest Hollywood blockbusters to TV shows. The intuitive menu options on KrisWorld are very well organised, making scrolling through them a breeze. Singapore Airlines provides earplugs for every passenger, though some might not find stuffing things in their ears comfortable. Singapore Airlines also provides complementary wifi for its KrisFlyer members (regardless of status) and passengers flying in Business Class or higher cabins. The wifi onboard is very stable but can only handle chats, email browsing and uploading to social media.

We were given two options for breakfast today – Singapore Fried Carrot Cake with Prawns and Scrambled Eggs with Chicken Sausage. I chose the Fried Carrot Cake for breakfast. I am not a fan of the take-out box design used in regional Economy Class, as it made the portion feel small and was challenging to eat from. Singapore Airlines only served its Economy Class passengers a yoghurt. The meal was delicious and full of flavours. My friend opted for the Scrambled Eggs and found the eggs to be a tad dry and the sausage bland.

Service onboard Singapore Airlines was impeccable, as always. We were greeted by the warm and friendly cabin crews. The cabin crew worked tirelessly to serve all the passengers and attended to their requests despite being a full flight. Despite the clear delineation of the duties of each flight attendant, cabin crews were ready to step in to help their colleagues should one be away from their station (during meal service) to top up food or handle other passenger requests not available on the food cart. The flight attendants’ felt happy in their job, which also translates to caring for their passengers.",positive
5548,"experience I choose Singapore Air coz i know if not the best its 1 of the best. But our flight from Male to singapore is 11pm unfortunately it was delayed. So when we were in the plane we were so hingry coz we didnot have our dinner coz lots of passengers in the dep area & the line is so long. 
When we were flying we wrmere waiting to serve the food but after 3hours they didnot serve when i asked the flight attendant wheres our food theybdaid they already finish serving food & they cannot serve ot anymore. I asjed why we didnot get our food? They said we didnot ask for it! Huh omg... as kuch as i want to get mad... i will rate them 5- average...

4529,"Business Class Supreme I have over a million miles on two US Domestic Carriers. Singapore Business Class is by far the best premium class airline I have flown. The service was superior to anything I have experienced and the comfort of the seats, especially in the ""bed"" mode was very comfortable. Try the ""Book the Chef"" services for creating your own menu on the flight. I had lobster thermidor at 35,000 feet for dinner. If I get a chance to travel to Asia again, I will definitely select Singapore Air. I wish they offered service out of Chicago Ohare.",positive

6810,"A great airline to fly with but the business class bed lets them down. Having had a connection from Madrid we arrived early into terminal two and the Singapore desks were not open but the desks in front were open and we were advised to use these as they could do exactly the same as the Singapore desks and we therefore saved about three hours waiting around for the gates to open, a good tip for anyone.
The lounge at Heathrow was a huge disappointment staff were more concerned about gossiping with each other than doing their jobs. Dirty plates were left on our table for an hour, the bar was often left unattended and when I went to use the showers I was shown initially into two showers that had dirty towels strewn on the floor.
 Checkin was quick and the welcome on board was friendly. The seat when in the seating position was the best I have flown on in business class but when converted into a bed was just too hard to get much sleep, hence the four not the five point rating. A mattress topper would have made the whole journey more enjoyable. I am 1m85cm tall and had no problem with the cubby hole space for your feet in sleep mode and this had been a concern prior to the flight. The meal service was excellent my steak from the book the cook menu was cooked to perfection for me and my partners duck was equally good. Drinks were topped up when needed and water was offered throughout the flight. Arrival in Changi was efficiency at its best. If the bed issue can be sorted out Singapore airways will become my go to airline.",positive
5576,"Great Service as allways I recently flew with Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Denmark through Singapore return trip with my 4-year old.

As it turned out, I got caught in the SAS pilot strike on a connecting flight when I had to return to Melbourne, and if it hadn't been for Singapore Airlines' brilliant customer service, I would have been stuck! Within 6 hours of emailing Singapore Airlines, I had a customer representative calling me offering me an alternative flight home, re-booked at NO EXTRA COST!! I am super impressed and grateful, and this is one of the reasons why I ALWAYS try to book Singapore Airlines before any other airlines!

Service and comfort on board the flights (MEL - SIN, SIN - CPH and AMS - SIN, SIN - MEL) were great with extra attention being paid to my pre-schooler with plenty of chats and making sure he was entertained. The child meals are also great, and I find it fantastic that they are served first, about 20-30 min before the normal meal service, giving a parent the chance to help feed the kid first and be able to eat my own meal while warm :-)",positive
1099,"FLIGHT FINE BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT CALL CENTRE The Flight was fine but I had a query before flight and wanted to speak to a person at the Airline. I hung on the phone for ages and never did manage to speak to anyway, so never got an answer to address my concern - so was very stressed ahead of the flight  in case I'd encounter a problem at the check in desk and be refused boarding (fortunately it was OK in the end but stress would have been reduced if I could have spoken to someone).",positive

8488,"Comfortable flight, plenty of entertainment and friendly staff! We'd flown with Singapore Airlines before Sydney to Thailand and were happy with the comfort and service so chose it for our long haul flights to London via Singapore. We were not disappointed. It was one of the cheapest flights with the shortest duration with transfers. We were very pleased that we could do International Check-in via our domestic airport in Newcastle NSW - only Singapore Airlines offers this so far. The flight was obviously long but comfortable with plenty of entertainment, food and refreshments to distract. Would definitely choose again!",positive
807,"Premium Economy not worth the money Seat 33D. The extra room over an economy seat was marginal in terms of leg room. The meal service is economy class and the service was poor by Singapore Airlines normal service standards. I had to ask for coffee and extra wine was not offered. After experiencing Air New Zealand's service on the previous leg, SA offering was simply poor. It is not worth upgrading from economy.",positive
3781,"Excellent in every way Singappre airlines is definitely a firm favourite of mine.
When you sit in economy class you are still treated as business class.
Friendly and attentive flight crew make the trip a pleasure. I have yet to have a trip with SQ that failed to live up to the high standards set.
I am 2m tall so, unfortunately, let room will always be an issue for me.",positive
4826,"Surprisingly Disappointing The seat was only ok since it only reclines up to about 40 degrees. The leg room when the legrest was raised is rather small, and I'm not even very big (175cm 72kg).
When the seat was folded down into a bed, you end up lying diagonal to the screen and into an even smaller footwell. In the entire ~36 hours of flight time, I don't think I ever found a comfortable position to fall asleep in. Everything just felt very un-ergonomic and just wrong in general.
The only positive feedback about the seats would be the many compartments available to store your belongings.

I ordered the Halal meal, which ended up being tasteless Indian food (i.e. Tasteless briyani with Tasteless unrecognisable Indian bread and something they try to pass as Curry) for ALL the services. I am sorely disappointed that SQ is not capable of providing decent halal meals like Emirates, Qatar or Malaysian airlines. Heck, even KLM does better. I would think they would be better off just serving me Vegan food instead. Both the ""halal"" dessert and normal service dessert were very underwhelming.

The inflight entertainment was good and I liked that you're able to sync it to your account to resume on other SQ flights. However, both my seat and neighbouring seat had to have our systems reset TWICE on the flight, which takes about 10-15 minutes. Which left me uninterested to resume watching and just carried on with entertainment on my iPad.

Overall, for the price I paid for a Business Class ticket, I feel like SQ did not deliver as compared to my other experiences with other Business Class seats in other airlines including KLM, Turkish Air, Malaysia Airlines, Emirates and Qatar Airways.

Honestly, this will not be a flight I will ever be taking again. I'd rather have a transit anywhere else and enjoy my flight, rather than take a direct flight from Singapore and just be uncomfortable the whole way.

I did enjoy the Virgin Atlantic lounge in EWR but the lounges in KLIA and Changi T3 were a HUGE disappointment in terms of lousy food selection.

On a more positive note, the flight crew were attentive and pleasant. They were also very apologetic when we complained about the rather insulting ""Muslim Meal"".",negative

BUT this is my first SQ premium economy and quite frankly, it was disappointing. the seats look better than they feel plus the trays are in the armrest reducing them further.  the food service is essentially economy plus bubbly.  the crew seemed lethargic and disinterested (thought i was on United for a moment) very unusal for SQ in my experience.  based solely on this flight, the added cost of premium economy was not close to worth it.",positive
3622,"Smooth flight All flights are much the same, but with a slightly different flavour. In flight meals ok and film choice pretty mundane. The crew were beautiful and charming. Connection in  Singapore was a bit too tight and meant running through the terminal as well as a monorail ride.

Not only were the people who originally had pre-booked meals (which by the way their website did not allow me to do) were serviced almost immediately while the rest of us had to wait more than an hour for our meals. My wife's meal was already opened - and cold! The air hostesses also seem to spent more time with clients with babies than on the rest of us. Breakfast on the morning was also a disaster - the choices we were given were obviously not for a breakfast!,negative
514,"Unpleasant uncomfortable new long haul planes What happened to Singapore  Airline? My flight out from  London to Christchurch was fine - very good for an economy class flight, as was the flight from Christchurch to Singapore, where I changed planes.  Then came the 14 hour flight to London. It was 14 hours of torture and discomfort punctuated with very poor food. ( Dry and overcooked pasta and chicken breast, no sauce, and veal sausages for breakfast.  No vegetarian options, and they ran out of white wine}. The seats in the new airbus  are tiny and the legroom is very limited, jammed up against the seat in front.  I’m 174 cm tall and not overly large. It was comparable to  China Southern, which is a lot cheaper and does not pretend to be a premium airline. I’ve done this trip several times on Singapore, but I think I have to reconsider using them. I’ve  had severe back pain all week, since this flight.  And when we got to Heathrow, there was a long wait for baggage as the airline didn’t have the resources to unload the baggage, so a 40 plus minute wait for most passengers, without explanation or assistance from the airline, and I had to pay an hours wait time to the car service I booked.",neutral

For self and my wife, two seats were allotted in the middle row. Since my wife was not doing well and it was a long flight, I wanted to have at least one window seat. Hence I immediately cancelled my check-in. 
When I went to airport with the luggage for check in, I requested for a window seat. I was denied saying that the flight was full. Since that flight hops at Hongkong, I requested whether I could get one window seat beyond Hongkong. She said that no passenger was alighting at Hongkong and hence window seat couldn't be allotted. I accepted and travelled.
But inside the aircraft, I found at least one window seat was vacant. Further lot of passengers alighted at Hongkong and new passengers boarded. It shows that the staff at the counter had lied us.
With much difficulty, after traveling about 17 hours, we landed in San Francisco.
We booked Hindu meals for both of us for our entire journey. However, I only was given Hindu meals and my wife was denied. As our tickets were booked under one PNR, then I don't understand why Hindu meal was denied for her. When my wife didn't accept the other meal, another staff offered Hindu meal.

We were not given the option, nor eceived an email at all about the return flights, which is their loss but I guess flights back to Oz do not have trouble being filled, so we plebs in economy don't get the offer. Anyway, the seats were still fine, those from Taipei back to Singapore (we cruised Singapore to there before having a week back in Singapore) and home, eventually were fine all round and they also organised transfers, although in shuttles. I'd pay for a car next time, as the shuttle driver was a bad-tempered jerk the night we got there from the cruise and ran us all over Singapore to get back at me for answering back when he was cross and nasty picking us up. Such is life. Food was as expected. Hosties are lovely and were kindly but firm when needed. Who would want their job, cleaning toilets?

Our flights one late afternoon from Phuket to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne.   The first is about 1 and half hours so barely time to reach our flight level before we were coming down but they offered a meal and drinks in that time, staff were attentive and efficient as expected.    The flight to Melbourne from Singapore, again everything you expect from this airline.   At least two meals offered during our flight both more than adequate.    As ours was late evening to early morning into Tullamarine, I was hoping that the lights would be turned off or lower than they were, so I could sleep a bit better, but apart from that my biggest issue is leg room being 180 cm, little hard to completely stretch out comfortably.

We did investigate the options of cancelling our trip and at the time SAL were only offering cacellations for flights to China and South Korea where the epidemic was taking off.

Great amenities, complete entertainment systems, and incredibly friendly attendants. The one mistake I made was not knowing that a ""stopover"" in Seoul, South Korea was actually a layover even though it did not show up on the itinerary as such. 

Stopping in Seoul requires going through security while exiting the plane and another security check before reboarding.

2106,"Standard dropped so much! Took from trf/cph/sin&return. It has been years since i flew with SQ (since the early 2000s) so I tot ok give them a chance although their prices are pretty high compared to other airlines like KLM or Finnair or BA cos as a citizen we always support our national carrier. Back then the services were very good but now it's really dropped so so much! See below..

-Preflight-
The booking online did not confirm meals for children upon booking only that we will have to arrange it again come 2 weeks prior to departure. (WELL KLM on the other hand automatically register a child seat =a child meal) Then a month or 2 before I fly i received an email saying they hv changed the departure time and that is not good as we had to make arrangements again to ensure our connecting trip timings fits etc. And they said in the mail that we will need to click to agree with the changes as otherwise we will be kicked off the flight and no refunds will be entertained! Well left us with no choice right??!

-1st leg of flight(oslo/cph)-
Bear in mind cos it's code share, they partner with SAS or wideroe from the leg trf/cph. Sas do not serve snacks nor drinks but on wideroe they serve just beverage. And wideroe&sas planes have smaller overhead compartments so your hand luggage need to comply with their measurements instead of SQ's. But as compared to klm, klm's plames can accommodate bigger hand luggages as their overhead compartments are bigger and they do serve a sandwich/snack+beverage. And SQ's fare is usually more expensive than klm's.

-2nd leg of flight (cph-sin)
Actual flight was just normal. I like it that they hv 'milo' on request on board. But my husband noticed that the stewardess mostly didn't really know their products on hand and have to always go ask her seniors back in the gallery whenever. So this was some wasted time waiting for a simple question. Example I asked if I can have a silver sling drink but she was unsure and had to ask her senior and had to walk to and fro many times again when my husband asked if he can hv some certain hard liquor. And the amount of hard liquor they offer in the cup is much lesser than what klm offers. And they will take a note (really writing down) of that which seat passenger has already got their liquor. And comes mealtime my children were offered just adult meals and when i enquired they said i had to book a child meal in advanced. I was dumpfolded..klm or either finnair do let u choose when u book the tickets online. But the stewardess was nice though.

-sin/cph-
Return flight was almost the same service again but this time I encountered a rude steward who is very grumpy. As my children got their meals first than adults, they have finished eating (as it's a night flight they didn't eat much) while he was serving me my meals and I requested him to remove my children's meal tray away and he said he is serving still. But I insisted that he remove it else I do not have the space to eat and settle down my children at the same time. He relented but very apparently annoyed as he just took the tray from me and walked all the way back to the gallery. Is this service?? 

-others-
The children activity kit that SQ gives out now is pathetic. Just some random not good quality colouring set with very very thin tracing paper..
Klm on the other hand gave out a comprehensive children activity set which included child eye shade, klm colouring pencils/cardboard print, tic tac toe games, card game set, amongst other things I forgotten in a felt bag.",negative

If you are only 2 travelling together, then the 2 only seats on either side of plane are perfect. In the middle is a 4 seat configuration. A much smaller secluded seating area with seats more like recliners. Large Entertainment screens, wider seats with more leg room. The best is the Noise cancelling headphones (not the earbud type you get in Economy). Even left it on when having a snooze as it amazingly cuts out all other noise. Needed to take them off when speaking with flying companion as couldn't hear a word spoken. Also have the choice of selecting your own meals by booking on line before flight (Book the Cook). A lot less expensive than upgrading to Business. If you choose to risk it and book Economy, you may receive an email a week before the 1st SIA flight, inviting you to make an upgrade bid. You won't know if your successful until 48hrs before flight. Did that the 1st time (2017) and were succesful.  2019 trip didn't want to risk it so paid for Premium Economy up front.

926,"Good as long as nothing goes wrong - they don't care at all We were migrating to Singapore permanently work work. I was travelling with my whole family. Typically we fly business with Singapore, which is an amazing experience. In this case I was given my marching orders and I had to get on the first available flight. Given our pleasant past experiences with Singapore Air the decision was a no brainer. We arrived at the airport on time but Virgin Australia simply did not process us on time. We spent nearly an hour in the queue and the lady that was checking us in was new and needed support, to which none was forthcoming from the virgin team. Needless to say we missed our flight. Virgin were absolutely dreadful, lost our baggage, blamed us for being late even though we were waiting in their queue, then sold us it was not their problem, call Singapore Air, so we did. To make a long story short Singapore did nothing to resolve the issue, left our whole family stranded when I had a deadline to meet, charged us over $6000 and wanted to charge us more for missing the flight, and have not responded to our lost baggage claim or complaint. Put simply you are running a risk if you fly with Singapore because THEY DO NOT CARE AT ALL about their customers. I travel regularly, needless to say it will be with other cariers moving forward. It's a shame because I have nearly 200,000 kris flyer points with Singapore that will now be discarded. BE WARNED, IF THINGS GO WELL YOU MIGHT BE OK, THEY DON'T SINGAPORE AIR WILL NOT HELP YOU AND FIND REASONS TO CHARGE YOU ADDITONAL FEES. THERE ARE NO PEOPLE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS TO ASSIST YOU. FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!",negative
3808,"Great service and friendly cabin crew Return from Bangkok yesterday evening .No complains about our  friendly and helpful cabin crews on board the flight. Excellent service. The only problem about this flight was the air-con doesn't seems to be working well. Initially, I thought it was me but the others (70A. 71 A, 72A) who was seated behind me and a few others on other rows also complained about the aircraft air-con. Hope Singapore airlines will look into it and do something about it. 
Thanks.",positive
566,"A nice and great flight Although I have written several reviews of Singapore Airlines (SIA) before, this review is the first in 3 years since the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic as world travel had been limited and restricted since then.

As the pandemic has more or less stabilised and traveling has been resumed, I also have restarted my ""walk around the world"". And all the while, I have been flying with SIA, unless for domestic flights.

So I am sharing this recent flight where I flew in the business class of the A350-900 aircraft.

First, the ambience was great and cosy and seat was very comfortable. I always prefer the Airbus over Boeing as the seat seemed ""larger and more comfortable"". And indeed it was!

Food and drink wise, very good. I had made my order online and so the crew did not have to ask and served the food to us. They were tasty and nice and during our entire flight, crew kept on coming and asking if we required any more drinks or snacks and making sure we were ""well fed"". Kudos to the crew team, and of course they were very friendly and polite, not to mention efficient and smiles were always on their faces. 

Although the check-in and bording process were a little slow (not to blame on the airline itself but the local staff working attitudes and procedures), the service inflight was totally another story, it was outstanding!

It's a comfortable flight, and also a stable one too! Even my 80+ mum was very satisfied with the entire flight experience as she didn't like to fly.

It's good to be able to fly again and of course great to be back at the Business Class. Moving forward, in 2023, I have plans to travel more with the airlines and ""it's a great way to fly, and whose service even other airlines talk about""!",positive
3153,"from first to last minute it was a 5-star experience There is nothing negativ I could say about the flight. The crew was extremely friendly and helpful, also during the night flight there where 2 stewardess taking care of every whish, and this not only because it was their job, but with empathy.
Comfort and cleanlyness gave no reason for a complaint.",positive
4034,"Excellent in every way Everyone from check-in counter to crews is very friendly and genuine. The service is excellent and food tastes great compared to other airlines' I have flown. I can feel the airline really work hard to set themselves apart from competitors. They gave passengers warm towels in economy and premium economy class as well. Even though, we didn't order kids' meal on one of our flight, the crew came to offer us to serve the kids first. Little things like this goes a long way when it come to airline experience. I love Singapore Airlines.",positive

842,"Singapore Airlines Strikes Again! Well well well… Singapore Airlines strikes again! 

After yet again another usual delayed flight with Singapore Airlines (FR208), from Heathrow to Singapore, the drinks service was non-existent, the only regular service was for business and premium economy classes. After almost dying of thirst, economy class passengers decided to start collecting their own drinks! Absolutely no effort was made by the captain to make up for lost time in the air, even though there was a tail wind for more than two thirds of the journey! 
This followed with a lack of communication between the Captain and the ground crew as a parking space for the aircraft had not been allocated on arrival,
causing further delays for passengers trying to disembark the aircraft for any further connection flights. Many passengers (about 45) had a connecting flight to bali from Singapore with the narrowest time window possible and yes of course the connection terminal was an early morning marathon as we all had to run from one side of the airport terminal  to get to the other side of a different terminal within Singapore airport. All 45 of us managed to board the connection flight but guess what…yes you guessed it…the baggage was not transferred to the flight ! Another outstanding stunt and lack of incompetence from Singapore Airlines. 
All 45 of us who were on the connecting flight are now on the other side of the world, after a 17 hour flight, with no luggage, having to buy clothes, shoes and toiletries out of our own pockets. Cheers Singapore Airlines, thank you so much for your lack of care, attention, support and customer service. You have ruined our holiday and cost us a lot of money. None of the 45  passengers with missing luggage are any wiser as to where our bags are, as you have washed your hands of speaking to any of us and have passed the blame onto someone else as usual. You do not care care for your passengers once you have had our money! 
PLEASE DO NOT FLY with SINGAPORE AIRLINES , unless you want to be treated like dirt. 
If there are any Singapore Airlines social media representatives out there who wish to manage their reputation by responding to this review with fake apologies, then please do not bother, instead, find our bags, compensate us for our expenses, ruined holiday and lost time. Do the right thing for a change and look after your passengers!",negative
9810,"Premium Economy 13 hour flight First time I used the Premium Economy class on Singapore Airlines, chosen due to the long flight and me being not well suited to the small economy class seats for such a long flight.
The seats are a luxury compared to the economy class seats but still far from business class. As the trays are not mounted to the seat in front you could remain reclined whilst food is served and could remain asleep in requested.
Good leg room and the seats reclined back more than economy. 
Bigger tv screen and you get your own arm rests so no need to struggle with your neighbours. 
I upgraded to premium economy from economy class. My employer allows me to claim back economy flight tickets so I only personally paid the cost of the upgrade. For short flights of less than 6 hours I personally wouldn't bother to upgrade but the long flight made a world of difference.
It's by no means anywhere near a business class flight experience but better than economy.
Just depends if you feel you can justify the extra approximatley 30% higher price.",positive

 The service received from the cabin crew in the upper deck was exemplary.  The team members Karrine Yap , Iver Tan and Alvin Tan were excellent and courteous. The service provided them is of a very high standard and should be an example for other crew members in any airlines. We would like to thank them for their fantastic hospitality and looking forward to similar services and experience.

6785,"Excellent Airline I flew Singapore Airline for the first time a week ago and I must tell you I was impressed with the service.  I purchased a premium economy seat at the bulkhead window.  The seat was large and the recline was amazing.  When you couple that with a great foot rest, big pillow and blanket you can’t go wrong.  
They supplied noise cancelling headphones.  The movie, TV, game and podcast selections were fabulous.  They had a few of my favorites like Bohemian Rhapsody and Boston legal, not to mention Pac-Man.  This was a 17 hour flight from LAX to Singapore.  They served two large meals and passed through the cabin too many times to count with snacks (sandwich’s, fresh fruit, chips, candy bars).  They also supplied socks, a toothbrush and eye shades.  The bathrooms had mouthwash.  
Short of a first class bed, this is top notch.",positive
7428,"Nice! I flew to Singapore with my family in 1964! We departed LHR from the Queens building and flew in a British Eagle Britannia turbo prop. It was my first ever flight and I still remember it to this day ... took almost 3 days and two stops. Roll on  almost 54 years...

Singapore Airlines A380 to Changi - departing T2 (Queens Building), completely new and have to say clean and efficient. SQ allows you to choose your seats at time of booking and there is no charge. I normally fly BA to Asia (2 or 3 times a year), but this time chose SQ because I got a bit of a bargin. PE seats there and back for a few quid more then Economy seats on BA.

From start to go the experience was an eye opener. Great seat, excellant service, meals very good. The cabin crew were round almost every hour with drinks and snacks. The difference with BA was night and day. They did thier best to keep everyone happy. I will definately fly SQ again. They deserve thier Best Airline rating.",positive
4254,"Food not the greatest We have flown many airlines around the world and was looking forward to revisiting Singapore airlines as they had a new plane now in service from Adelaide.

The staff are lovely, there is no fault there.  As we were placed down the back (if you didn't pay extra to pick your seat on this already overpriced fare, being school holidays, the back is where you get placed) by the time the food got to us the best choice had already been taken and the only option was a fishy pasta with the most chewy, rubbery prawns I have ever had, which was disgusting.  I know airline food is not always the best but for the past 3 years of flying Qatar, Qantas, British Airways, American Airlines and more, this would have to be the worst.  My son was ordered a kids meal but was given an adults meal, which we didn't realise and then had to ask for his meal.

There is not too much leg room as with most planes, but the seats and entertainment were good.

On the flight coming home, it was supposed to leave Singapore at 11:10pm but was slightly delayed leaving.  They don't serve you anything, you have to press service to get drinks throughout the flight.  About 4:30am in the morning they wake everyone to eat an average meal.

The last time we flew with them (13 years ago) we were given a toothbrush, socks etc but nothing but a blanket and pillow this time.

If I was going to Europe again, it wouldn't be with Singapore Airlines.",neutral
338,"Staff went over and above to help me During this 12-hour flight, I got my period, the toilets do have an amenities draw so I was able to utilise this. There was blood on my olive-green jeans that was very obvious. The staff of the flight gave me a dress to put on and then proceeded to clean the blood off my jeans. They did and then gave them back just as it was time to start preparing for landing. Who on earth would do this? The flight attendants were just so lovely and discreet. i cannot commend them enough for this as I had another 5-hour flight to go in my journey. Thank you ever so much Singapore Airlines, I highly recommend this airline for travel, economy was still very comfortable and we did no go hungry.",positive

6827,"Additional Singapore Airlines Premium Economy Review Posted a review 2 weeks ago from SFO to HKG. This is the return flight from HKG to SFO. The previous flight didn't give me a pleasure experience. One of the reason is the flight is fulled, somehow it affected the service quality. This time, the flight is only half fulled so it's quite a different. 

I can occupied the whole row with 4 seats. Much more room for me, and I can slept across 3 seats that get me have 6 hours + sleep.

The book the chef meal quality is about same as before. Foods taste so-so, the snacks offer seemed better, also the flight attendants are much more friendly and helpful during the flight.

Otherwise, the priority boarding and baggage handling are good as before.

In addition so glad to see that the air mileage added to my account quickly within few days.

Overall, I will be glad to flight with Singapore Airlines again but better choose a good timing that have a better pleasure flight.",positive
6817,"Overnight flight My wife, 2 year old son and I flew to Cape Town from Singapore, with a stop over in Johannesburg for an hour.

We were disappointingly underwhelmed by the experience. We were expecting so much more for the premium economy experience considering the level of quality they deliver in Business Class.

It was essentially flying economy class with a different seat. The food and beverage were average with small servings and served in cardboard boxes and plastic cups.

The seat, even though having one of the smallest pitch for that class in the industry, was quite comfortable, and we are able to get a reasonable sleep.

The inflight entertainment was suitable, but was turned on quite late, and unavailable for the hour we were on the aircraft in Johannesburg.

We would consider other options before flying premium economy with Singapore again.",negative

9852,"Deserves its reputation as one of World’s Best Airlines Flying on an Airbus 380 with Singapore Airlines in Business Class is what I imagine travel with airlines was like 50 years ago in their golden age- only better. Legendary Singapore Air flight attendants live up to their reputation - beautiful people, men and women, who display great poise and are wonderful hosts. Seating in business class is st least a step or two above that of most other airlines. B-class seats are almost 2x the width of Delta One or United business class. And they turn into true lay flat beds, more than just fully reclining seats. And yes, the food. It’s really good, truly gourmet. In summary, it you have the choice to fly business class on Singapore air, and if the prices are even close to the same class of travel on other airlines, go for it- you won’t be disappointed.",positive

In spite of that, the entire travel experience was still memorable because of the incredible service and luxury. The crew was most understanding and apologetic and upon re-boarding, they had everything prepared for me to rest as soon as possible, then have a great meal before landing. Needless to say, the suite was fantastic, even if it was the older version. I felt as if I was traveling on my own jet. Helped a lot too, that there was only one other suite class passenger in the cabin.

3164,"Best Airline 2018 I flew round trip from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Zurich, Switzerland because I got a good promo deal. I was so impressed that this year I decided to fly to Italy again on SIA.

I flew to Milan first, then went to Florence and Venice by trains. Embarked on a cruise from Venice which ended in Rome. Flew out of Italy from Rome. 
Even though I flew economy class, the seats were wide enough and spacious leg room. Service was good. There is an ""in between meals"" snack menu so I was never hungry. Anytime throughout the flight, you can ask for sandwiches, biscuits, nuts, chips, apples or instant noodles.",positive

5143,"How did they get Best Airline?? We flew Singapore Airlines flight SQ236 Brisbane to Singapore return, in business class. Honestly we have had better service on Jetstar economy.
The Singapore lounge in Brisbane was nice , small but modern and clean with great staff and that’s about the only good thing I could say regarding staff, once we hit the air it was downhill . 
The A350 is a nice plane, seats are wide and comfortable , but for $6000 a return ticket you would expect some service. We booked the cook pre flights , the meal was served mine and my husbands meals 45 mins apart. No drinks were offered during the meal service. 
I requested water and waited for 25 mins until I had to flag down an attendant and wait again.
The return flight service was just as bad , the staff look annoyed to be there.
Breakfast was not served flying into Brisbane and it seemed a bother to ask for a coffee.
If you could have the plane and swap the staff over with any budget carrier it might be ok.
Seriously rude staff, no amenities kits in business , wi fi didn’t work , dirty toilets.
Save your money and fly a budget carrier you will get the same service . 
Singapore is going downhill , charging for a presumed level of service you won’t get .",negative

I think his attitude rubbed off on some of the other crew as there was no smile on this flight, most unusual for Singapore Airline.

The crew is extremely friendly, smiling and helpful. Even in the final hours of a stressful 12 hour flight. There is enough food and drinks. Also the crew was not tight on giving alcoholic drinks (this is what you want in vacation haha). Also a full and delicious meal on a 2 hour flight from/to DPS is just awesome compared to European carriers.Regarding cleanliness, I have never seen a cleaner long haul plane than this. The crew cleaned the restrooms all the time and refilled papers. Also, the crew kept an eye on cleanliness of the galley and aisle and removed papers or whatever trash was on the floor. I have not seen this before.
The IFE is basically perfect. The selection of movie, TV shows and music outstanding, also the program is up to date and the touch screen is very responsive.

3899,Great airline  We flew to and from Bali with Singapore airlines flying from Tokyo/Japan! It was so nice getting the hot towels to freshen up and the meals were delicious and very filling! On our way to Bali the flight from Singapore to Bali was short and sharp the flight attendant was rushing we felt sorry for her! Then on our way home we got the partner airline silk air to Singapore this was a little disappointing as there wasn’t any entertainment but it was a short flight so that was okay. The flight was delayed I think due to Bali airport but the airline gave us a little food voucher to use in the airport at Singapore while we waited for our new flight that was rescheduled (3 hours was all we were behind so not bad)  and then from Singapore to Tokyo was amazing the best plane we had been on! It had nice TVs with very recent movies and it was a great experience to finish our holiday on! The options of food were amazing again and the flight attendant was so kind he gave us a few fizzy drinks and topped us up rather then just 1 cup like some airlines! Would definitely recommend Singapore airlines to people! Thanks so much for the great experience!,positive
732,"Be happy if you never have to talk to a Singapore Airlines Customer Service representative Had to rebook my Business class flight and called Customer Service 5 times - and received 5 different answers. After call2, I asked for a summary of agreed actions of the call, which I was refund. Calling back, as Singapore was still not able to rebook me, I received completely different information about rebooking opportunities. Flying Singapore Airlines is joy, having to discuss any issues with a customer service representative a clear disaster!!!! Never again!",negative
3243,"The way flying used to feel I enjoyed my 24+ hour (per leg) flight with Singapore Airlines. From the pleasant hospitality, to the helpful crew, this flight was no problem even though it spanned so many hours with 2 layovers and 3 countries. From the hot towel at the beginning of the flight, to the continual beverage service, to the mid-flight snacks and meals, Singapore Airlines is definitely the way to fly on such long-haul trips. Thank you Singapore Airlines!",positive
1518,"Singapore airlines luxury! This was an upgrade we considered for a long flight from Amsterdam to Brisbane for some time before committing, and I am pleased to say this was a great choice, it was the most enjoyable long haul flight either of us had ever experienced. 
The seating is one plus one, no pesky middles with elbow wars... all very comfortable, and quite easy to sleep (if you feel the need).  The entertainment system allows time to drift away, and without doubt this is helped along significantly by the noise cancelling headphones supplied.  The A350 is a little louder than an A380 - not too bad though, and the majority of the flight I had headphones glued to my scone.  Definitely did not feel any noise issues, with or without the headset.  
In flight food was very good without quite being up to the Emirates gold standard.
Our final leg of the trip involved a switch to the front seats in this premium block, while still very comfortable, the screens are a little more distant, so what you gain in legroom you lose in entertainment standard, this worked in well anyway as I needed some beauty sleep, I am after all only here as eye candy.  
On the whole, an excellent trip, and well worth the upgrade.",positive
1842,"Ok, but overrated this time Started at airport when the ground staff tried to scammed me with overweight, i said im allowed to bring 40 kilo in business,the wieght scale desk counter was totaly wrong calibrated,and i told them when i showed my hand weight scale and they said i was wrong, and i told to check in another desk and there it was i told them 40 kilo exactly,pls how hard can it be to calibrate the weight scale, and wonder how many they scammed,the flight from Bangkok to Singapore was also a plane change with no flat bed, from Singapore to Copenhagen i felt the staff was stressed to give the food as quickly as they could so they could go sleep, no fill up red wine and no whisky to the dessert,, so nope it fails to be one of the best aircomp in the world will not book again,the wifi didnt work so No No",negative

5248,"Singapore Airlines - Adelaide to Singapore (Changi) Business Class On arrival at Adelaide Airport, the check-in staff we helpful and as a business class traveler received priority express check-in at the airport. Once clearing the security checkpoint at Adelaide airport i was able to quickly approach the immigration area. There was a priority express immigration lane for business travelers and i was the first traveler through immigration and into the secure international departures. Once you clear immigration you have access to a duty-free shop. The Singapore airport lounge at Adelaide Airport is small but has everything you need. There are drinks and a small selection of food. Access to the lounge is via a set of escalators down to the lower level. At the bottom of the escalators turn left and the lounge is right in front of you. When it was time to board, i left the lounge and headed straight to the gate and again received priority boarding past all the other travelers waiting in line to board the plane. Once on board it was a very comfortable flight. The flight was aboard A350-900 (9v-shd) which only entered service at the end of January 2019 so was all of 4 months old. The air crew were all very hosptiable and the food and drink service was very good. This new plane had a large touch screen with a very good selection of movies and tv shows. This is connected to a touch screen remote so you can access your media selections while reclined. There was a single mains outlet for any power you may need (laptop) and 2 x USB charging ports too, which i found very helpful. There was also on-board wi-fi for business travelers which was great. There is a complimentary 30MB of data which lasted me about half of the 7 hour journey. There is the option to buy more data for a small fee, but i opted not to use this. The aircraft had approximately 40 business class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration and only about 50% of the seats were occupied. I purchased my return ticket on sale in March 2019 for approximately $3000 AUD. Baggage allowance permits 40kg checked bag and 2 x cabin bags of 7kg each. Check-in staff did way the cabin baggage at check-in, which i thought was a little surprising, but although one bag was over the 7kg, the other was not and they were happy for me to leave items as they were and just suggested i remove my lap-top from the heavier bag when boarding. 

On arrival in Singapore the disembarking process was excellent. Within 30 minutes of touch-down, we had taxied to the gate, disembarked, cleared customs, collected bags and checked into my airport hotel (Crowne Plaza). Such a quick and painless process. Highly recommend.",positive
2229,"Still one of the better economy class seats People often expect to be provided the best service on Singapore Airlines, but feel that its service standards are not met in economy class. Definitely you cannot expect business class service while paying only 20% of the price. Product-wise it is still one of the best economy seats on the Boeing B777 are comfortable, but is smaller than the Airbus A380 on the alternate schedule. When the person in front of you reclines their seat, the back of the seat can get too close for comfort if you are watching a movie. In-flight entertainment is where Singapore Airlines shines, with various genres of movies, TV dramas and variety shows on the menu.",positive

7311,"to fly, to serve OK, I know the above title is BA's tag line but in the case of Singapore Airlines it really feels sincere and authentic, at least at the front of the plane. The welcome, attention and recognition is quite extraordinary compared to Britain's flag carrier. Sure, prices are higher but the difference in customer experience is palpable at all levels - from the priority boarding which really differentiates and works, through the (old fashioned) provision of newspapers and periodicals on board and the outstanding service, to the quality of the offering in terms of seating space/equipment and the quality of the products (Dom Perignon for example - BA used to have Krug, now it's Perrier-Jouet). Is everything perfect ? No, for instance in the take-off/landing position I found the seats rather uncomfortable even if they're roomy but overall SQ is a class apart and it starts with the crew who come across as really caring about the passengers by comparison to the hit and miss standards of some BA flight staff nowadays.",positive
4928,"Very disappointed with the new A350 and premium ecconomy Last time I reviewed Singapore Airlines I gave them a excellent for their service and business class product. This time I tried their premium economy and what a huge disappointment. I can't for the life of me see where they can justify twice the price of economy for very little extra. Leg room is no better than the exit row in economy, seat room is slightly more than economy, service no better than economy and unlike other airlines there's no pre-takeoff drink. You do get noise cancelling headphones, (At that price though I'd rather use my own). You walk back through economy to use their toilet's, (what few there are), You aren't separated from economy as you are from Business. I experienced the same on the onward leg from Singapore to London on their A380. Use Air New Zealand for premium economy as they set the standard by being rated the best in that class. Honestly, never again. I'll avoid Singapore Air until it matches or betters Airlines like Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific, Quantas, (Yes even Quantas).",neutral
3854,"Rude ground handling, especially for my kids. This was the most traumatizing experiences with an airline for my family, especially for my two kids. 

On that day, it was our last day in Netherland after I finished my study there and we will leave for good. I already counted my luggages (many luggages) both checked in and cabin. All based on our past experiences with different major airlines i.e. Etihad, KLM, Emirates, Garuda, ANA Air, Qatar Airline, etc. That we will be okay.

So, at the airport as per our calculation all the checked baggages went it without problem. The rest is the cabin baggage, which were 1 cabin suitcase and 1 handcarry for each person (with additional kids backpack, for each of my kid). So, all went well until we were at the boarding gate. The ground officer there (male officer) said rudely that: ""what are you thinking? Bringing that many luggages to the cabin?"" And then he try weighing all my luggages based on his ""instinct"" and said that we overweight 30 kilos and must pay 856 Euro. I start panicked, my wife crying, my kids crying. So I choose to throw away all those luggages ans board the plane. But then, after almost entering the plane, they came chased us and yelled I cannot throw my luggages like that. So how I am supposed to do?!?!?! Then, I choose to pay. I had 400 euro in my saving and the rest by cash, so it should be enough. But then, they said they cannot accept debit and/or cash, only credit card! At that time my credit card was not enough to cover that amount. So ultimately, we were kicked out and all of our checked baggages were dropped off. Our flight then re-scheduled to the next day (thanks to the nice lady).

So, we sorted everything and throw away many important goods, memento from our life in Netherlands, etc. We wnet again to check in and met again with the male ground handling officer. All the baggages checked in and now they wanted to see our cabin carry on, we were treated like a criminal, my kids were scared to death. After long check, the male officer was pointing at my kids backpack, said that those too already too much for a cabin carry on, I mean...its just a 5 and 8 years kids backpack for god sakes! And, so I told the kids that we must throw their backpacks away. So we did that. Then we went through the boarding process all over again. We were separated from the rest of customer by the same male officer, again, like we were a criminal. He test each of our cabin baggage again with his instinct, after long tiring process, we can board the plain.

Interesting fact was, when we transit in Changi, we saw several person that brought three items to the plane, cabin suitcase, backpack and carry on bag (one of them I manage to took the picture). So where is the absolute strictness of 1 person 1 cabin baggage gone? Is it only applied to specific country, or what? So, I just told my children that I will get them a new bag, better than the bags they forced to threw away and also promised them that we will not fly with Singapore airlines again, ever.",negative

2230,"No longer the best in the World My wife and I have recently returned from a trip to Cairns, QLD via Singapore with Singapore Airlines:

12/11/19 - LHR - SIN - SQ317
20/11/19 - SIN - CNS - SQ5339 (MIxxx) Operated by Silk Air
18/12/18 - CNS - SIN - SQ5340 (MI814) Operated by Silk Air
19/12/19 - SIN - LHR - SQ 306

Once upon a time Singapore Airlines had no competition in quality of service and in particular their inflight service. Having flown with them twice previously in the early 90's I have first hand knowledge of this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case, they are middle of the road at best and their Silk Air affiliate is at best a budget airline, and that’s saying something. 
I must point out that the aircraft and cabin/flight crew were excellent, one would expect nothing less from and international carrier. The problem lies with their inflight service, McDonalds would have been better, and I’m a vegetarian and there lies their problem. 
My wife and I are both Vegetarian (for health and NOT moral reasons) yet Singapore Air do not offer a Vegetarian in flight meal, they off a Vegan option - THIS IS NOT VEGETARIAN - I give the following example, on the Silk Air flight both to and from Cairns QLD whilst everyone one around us was being offered a Muffin and Small Cake we were give a dry, slightly stale bread roll, hmmmm.
So come on Singapore Air, get your act together, review your inflight service and offer some decent Vegetarian Food.
My final point relates to Silk Air inflight Audio/Video, if you don’t have a tablet or smart phone you just sit there for 6+ hours.",neutral

9043,"Nice flight from HKG to CHC We recently flew to Christchurch, New Zealand with Singapore Airline with a layover in Singapore. The flights were good across the board. 

Flights were booked online at the Singapore Airline website, email confirmations were received in a timely manner. Check-in at HKG was quick and easy. 

Our first flight between HKG and SIN departed and arrived on time and was comfortable. In-flight meal was ok, movies and other entertainment fine for a 3 hour flight. 

Layover at Changi Airport was as good as it gets. This is a great airport when it comes departure area and in-transit experiences. Orchard gardens, butterfly gardens, koi ponds, Osim chairs and other comfortable seating throughout the various terminals makes for a relaxing place to await outbound flights leaving Changi Airport. 

Our second flight from SIN to CHC was really good. Departure and arrivals were on time. Seats comfortable with plenty of leg space, allowing decent rest during the long flight. We slept surprisingly well during the flight. Meals served were decent, in-flight entertainment was sufficient with a good mix of movies and TV shows. 

Immigration processing was quick in Christchurch, luggage was received no longer then 20-25 minutes after we had disembarked, customs were cleared and we were picking up our rental vehicle in no longer than 40-45 minutes after arriving. 

Overall, this was a seamless and good overall flight experience with Singapore Airline.",positive

I do understand that there are definitely new steward/stewardess every year. I believe there would be ample training for them before they started to fly. But I don't know if they are the new stewardess or have been there for some time. There are about 2 main meal serving and 1 teabreak serving. I can understand if you make mistakes for the 1st meal serving. However, each serving was either short of some cutlery or the food was taken wrongly, or the stewardess were busy entertaining themselves while serving. It just makes my whole journey unpleasant. I also do understand that the walkway is a bit small and these stewardess can bump here and there. I don't see it in any other flight, at least. Everyone said it's the best, and I thought I should give a chance again. But, each flight in SQ just make me regret more.",neutral

7117,"Makes Jetstar look like a1st class Airline Airbus 350-900 the latest cattle truck employed by Singapore Airlines. The economy section has the most uncomfortable cramped cabin of any plane in their fleet. SA has gone from one of the best airlines to a standard of a budget airline. Leg space has been reduced dramatically, seat width cut drastically, armrests... the next air rage front as one battles to share  the 25 mm wide armrest with your neighbouring passenger. The seats are the most uncomfortable I have experienced....like sitting on wooden bench....something that a Monk might  be forced to sit on as a penance. Over the course of a 13 hour flight I got an extremely sore bottom.
If you want an exit row seat then you have to pay up to US$120 per leg
To travel from Italy to Australia SQ245/246/355/356 return cost us an extra US$600 as I am 6ft 3in and in a normal seat my knees hit against the seat in front. In a flight the year before I had my knees gashed as the passenger in the seat in front slammed their seat fully back. I yelled in extreme pain called the cabin staff  and attendant said that the person in front was fully entitled to put their seat all the way back and I should have booked an exit row seat....what an attitude! I had a deep gash and severe bruising for over the next 10 days. The aisles are so narrow that if you dare to have your elbow on the outer armrest then it will be hit by the food trolley. The fit down the aisles is barely minimal. My wife had her elbow hit on all the legs we flew. In the exit rows 47  seats B and J have a stupid entertainment screen set up where the stem has a right angled bend that intrudes into the seat leg space. Why they chose this configuration is beyond me as the adjacent seat has a straight stem. 
Food.....or should I say ""slops"". Once noted for great food in economy class this has deteriorated to some of the most foul food I have ever tasted. Ordered seafood meals for all legs and did not eat all of the main meals as three of them consisted of a piece of  disgusting smelling fish in a sloppy gravy. The fish didn't even taste like fish.. The only saving grace was a breakfast that consisted of a smoked salmon omelette. 
We like to split our trips into sectors with an overnight stop over. I might try going with Emirates again but Dubai is not the best stopover destination if you have been there once.....Las Vegas on steroids! Unfortunately flying to Australia the choice of airlines is limited with a majority having hubs in either Asia or the Middle East. All in all I fail to see how this airline can be voted No1 in the world. If it were to  be rated on purely the economy cabin then if would be well down the list. It is interesting that first and business class which only make up 25% of the seating dictates the thinking of the groups that rate the airlines.

The staff member then chose our seats for us for both the outward and return journey. The cabin crew were very attentive and courteous.

7363,"Big Mistake By Airline Having used a free upgrade from Business to Suites, I find it unbelievable that SQ can make such a big mistake in their new cabin. Nothing is aligned, very little storage, could fit my laptop case in the wardrobe. Seat positions dont work for comfort.

539,"Not so World Class! No so 6 Star Hospatility! I recently flew on flight SQ241 from Singapore to Sydney.

Being Thailand based, I fly very often on this route and the carrier I use are mainly Thai Airways or Singapore Airlines. On my several occasions flying on Singapore Airlines, I experience the same reoccurring nightmare on my inflight experience in economy class that I question their sequence of service in this cabin.

I am not a fussy nor needy traveler, but I have year of travel experience to give an opinion. This nightmare has become unbearable for me and want to share my experience.

We all know that crew members attend briefing, and all crew knows the flight profile of the flight. SQ241 & SQ211 flights, has lots of connecting passengers from India. Lots of special meals, babies & bassinet requests, and wheelchairs etc.

Flight often delayed due to connecting passengers. Understandable.

First meal service begins from the front of economy class cabin. Continental breakfast (no big deal) easy on the crew, drop food trays on tray tables, coffee/tea/juice etc. Special drinks request is still manageable as crew often don’t stock various soft drinks in their trolleys. The crew must run up and down the aisle to get stock for passengers. Yes, I get it when stock runs down during service but not every time a passenger ask for soda water and the crew keep running back and forth. This part I don’t get it. 

I have seen in other airlines that I have travelled with has one dedicated crew doing drinks cart (including mixers and cocktails) and one dedicated to doing meal trays. The crew that does the meal services cart than come back to help with drinks services once all the meals trays are on tray tables. 

Some airlines have some form of liquid to offer you with your meal tray i.e., sealed cup or bottle of water or a terra pack of juice (something small) to tie the pax for the moment until the drinks trolley comes to their section for more drinks or special drinks.

For the main meal before landing, the crew took a long time to sort out special meals. Seem like there was lots of confusion and missed meals for passengers. The plane was full of passengers from India. They are around me and I can hear their request/demands to why their meals are not served yet and are wrong meals. As confirmed by a crew member when we asked.

I was served my meal 40mins before landing. Being at the front of the cabin, you are being served last because the meal service begins from the back of the cabin this time. We could have been served in a timely manner if your senior crew is organized with their special meals request.

10 mins into my meal, the captain announces to crew to prepare cabin for landing. I had to rush thru my meal and finish quickly. My request for a soda water could not be fulfilled (can you guess why…. crew were trying to feed passengers and clear trays at the same time, plus they do not stock sufficient soft drinks in their trolley.) so I settle for an apple juice. No big deal.

It was in the last 20mins before landing that I saw 3 crew members from business class came to economy class to help the crew to prepare the cabin for landing. Stowing away passenger’s luggage/bags, bassinets, taking food trays away etc. Wonder where the co-operations amongst crews went in the earlier part of the crisis. We understand crews has specific duties to perform but it was a crisis in economy class but no sign of any camaraderie on that flight amongst crew.

So, with that said, we asked to speak with a senior member of the crew in charge of the cabin (red kabeya) but she did not turn up. It took a second request that she finally came to have a word with us. 

She knew everything that we had to tell her. She even said that we know more than her and the crew members.

Crew members attend pre-flight briefing, if you know that you have over demands for special meals request what would you do?

Crisis management, getting help from other cabin crew when there is a crunch in Economy class. Is the senior crew in red kabeya afraid that her integrity be questioned or will she loose face because she did not plan her workflow properly? Or that’s our (SQ) procedure and policy, we are adhering to it! (Heard that excuse from a crew member before on other SQ flights to Sydney)

So, in conclusion, Singapore Airlines over the years have hyped up travelers’ expectations when flying on Singapore Airlines. Even more now with this “world class” thing that we see advertised all over the world.

It is very difficult to be reasonable and forgiving even in the smallest glitch that may occur, be it the service or the hardware. It’s supposed to be “world class” and that is everything you do; it’s supposed to be perfection. It’s supposed to be 6-star hospitality.

With no help from social media, lots of good and bad comments are floating out there, some are legit, and some are just pure unreasonable. I am sure you have a team to look at those to decipher and respond.

Personally, I will refrain from flying this route on Singapore Airlines. One less passenger/s will not make a difference to your company’s profitability. One less passenger/s will not make any difference to how “world class” you want to be. It has been an experience/s over time that is unforgettable.",negative

6438,"Singapore Airlines “UNIQUE TOUCH” Today I have decided to give my airline review a little twist of different.

We all rave about the caviar, champagne, recline of a seat, lighting, storage space, personal minibars and the whole sort. However, if we look a little closer what matters in creating a memorable experience and a loyal customer is to penetrate our hippocampus which forms a long term memory.

To stimulate that part of the brain we need unique “passager engagement.”  One avenue that could be explored is creating an amenity kit that is actually of value and strategically filled with products that enhance that experience. I will post the highlights (photographs) that In which I experienced throughout my journey but I will focus more on people engagement (crew) more so than the aspects of flying a given carrier.

 Upon arriving at Changi Airport for my “Suite Class” to check-in for my flight to Zurich, I approached the SQ counter and was directed to check-in at the First Class private room which I was given directions to.

 Upon walking around the airport with no First Classroom in site, I approached another SQ staff, and again a pointed finger directed me to a specific direction. { Customer engagement failure } twice already.

While in the SQ check-in I patiently waited for 10 minutes in front of 4 check-in desks that were empty while employees played with their phones { lack of customer engagement }.

 
With my luggage and handbag dropped in front of desks I walked outside of the terminal and asked the curbside agent if someone can assist in checking me in.
The agent did apologize, but at this point an apology was meaningless.

I was told that I “cannot"" check my bags all the way to my final destination and only when I argued with him did he turn to ask the supervisor which she replies “of course.”

 From that point on I have to say the Singapore Airlines customer engagement which they are so fabled for in the industry started to flourish…

I was escorted through the private immigration formalities and on to the “Private Room Lounge“ where a whole army of staff was on hand to assist in every way possible.

 A lite bite was welcomed in the A la carte dining room while enjoying a few glasses of Krug.
 

Walking around another 10 minutes, I walked up to Qatar Airways counter, and that individual walked me over to the SQ First Class private check-in room.{excellent example of customer engagement }.

Upon stepping on board and handing the flight attendant my boarding pass, I was addressed by my surname and from this point on the SQ service shined.

 The bottles of Krug were popped and free-flowing throughout the flight.

Flight attendants were empathetic, engaging and most courteous. The inflight supervisor introduced himself and explanations from dinning, flight time, turbulence if expected, preference for sleeping everything and anything was so meticulously explained.
Inflight catering was orchestrated like a beautiful ballet but with an open script that can be manipulated ( or rewritten )to a passengers profile. Customer engagement was personalized, heartwarming and sincere.

No question or concern was ever too much of a task or a burden.
Passenger privacy was respected but at the same time engaging.
The crew was professional, and every passenger was treated according to their needs.

Ten hours passed gracefully - Flight attendants were never congregating in the galley, and when you did approach for any reason you were always greeted with a smile and sense of caring.
All crew was groomed as if they were on a runway fashion show, never did they let jet lag and long hours of duty affect their professionalism.

Customer engagement on this particular flight was exceptional, with many unique memories embedded in my brain.

 This is an excellent example of securing a loyal customer.

 Life is a journey, enjoy the adventure.

Though we did have a little issue with the food as there was a little confusion in the food that we had ordered and which was served..but it was promptly solved by the crew on board.

5806,"Do not live up to Star Alliance Partnership spirit A family of 6 travelling, 2 biz (paid), 4 economy (2 paid, 2 redemption). 
SQ doesn't offer LAX or SFO connection to ORD for 1 stop, hence we have to book separately on UA and upon check in, they failed to link up the final destination for our baggage and we have to re-checking through the counter again (instead of dropping off on domestic)

SQ web recommended 2 stop SIN-FRA-JFK connection with a non Star Alliance  JetBlue Airways, this is totally, this outrages that waste our time and our membership privileges were compromised. All your hard earned Gold Status are not put in good use.

Why could not they do a better SIN-SFO-ORD (1 stop) connection with UA? after all ORD is UA hub?  SQ do away with its own Kris Lounge in SFO.

4602,"Competition catching up with Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines is still at the top of the game for Business Class. However the competition is catching up fast. For example, Qatar Air's new business-class privacy shutter doors are a first in the class segment. And Emirates have their bar-lounge area in their 380 business class too. 

I would strongly recommend SQ to reconsider down-sizing and standardizing their business-class seats to the industry norm during their progressive ""upgrading."" Their current business class seats are the widest and most comfortable I have experienced, and should preferably be retained for long-haul flights on wide-bodied planes. Suggest to feature the narrower-width business class seats just for their narrow-bodied, single aisle planes covering short-haul regional flights.",positive

7402,"Los Angeles- Singapore by Sq35 Premier Economy Recently i traveled to Singapore on its new direct 17 hour flight. I have traveled quite a bit  on AA, SAS & Turkish Airlines Premier Economy class in the past to Asia & Europe, always had a good experience. I thought SA new direct service should be on par with other carriers if not better.  I was wrong!  I used its ""Book the Cook"" online since there was  mixed review about in flight meals. On this long flight, SQ served two meals and a snack. I was a bit taken back and in fact shocked when they brought out the first meal. It was in a small plastic tray, with shrimp entree covered in a twisted foil paper, a salad and a desert.( It seems that it missing something like appetizer, since there is empty space on the small tray). It just looked unappetizing and entree portion is very small.  The second meal was served the same fashion. In between, they serve  donuts and small finger sandwich. I have not touched donuts for years ! But i was starving and had to grab a super sweet donut! Service lacks throughout the flight, though flight attendant seemed to work hard ( i think the flight was understaffed!). No napkin paper provided when serving a drink and nuts. Had to constantly ask for napkins,spoon(for that solid ice cream). Approached the flight attendant at galley for a hot tea, and assured that it would be brought to my seat. The tea never came!   The only saving grace is that i was able to grab one of the 6 solo seats at the back of cabin. My seat was comfortable and the plane is brand new.  On this same trip, i took a much shorter 3 hour flight from Bangkok to Taipei on China Airlines economy class, i was served one meal in much more respectable way (in terms of presentation, quality and portion).

572,Poor service Me and my partner have  been flying with Singapore Airlines for the last 10 years. Initially they were absolutely fantastic and faultless. Since flying after Covid the standard of the service including cleanliness of toilets and quality of the food served was poor. The vegan options were poor with no choice and all the other meals served were absolutely of the lowest quality. We were delayed 2 hours whilst sat on the plane and not  even offered refreshments. I had to pay an additional £500.00 to change my partners flight to fly back home with me due to her poor health. There was no reason in my opinion as the plane had plenty of spare seats. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines as they only care about Business class clients and those who buy there fancy Suites.

6652,"Good but has serious competition I had been looking forward to SIA's business class for some time and, overall, was not disappointed.  Whether it was the high expectation or the lack of delivery but it was not the greatest of experiences.
Istanbul - check-in 3 hours before the flight was excellent and we were directed to the Express Path for Customs/Immigration and into the Turkish Airlines Lounge within minutes.
Boarding was good - SIA only has the one flight from Istanbul daily so gets punted to a   very remote gate for a very long drive to the aircraft - premium cabin passengers do get priority and a separate bus but in adverse weather it would be an ordeal.
On-board - greeting and seating was excellent and I had no initial issues with the seat or cabin.  Travelling with my wife and she ended up with a Flight Attendant who was not having a good day and who then was quite curt/brusque with passengers - none of the Singapore Girl's charms on display here.
Dining - excellent - food and drink was really good and the Book The Cook option was a good one to explore.
Seat/Entertainment - very good but longer-term, the seat was uncomfortable.  SIA is often lauded for having a very wide seat but it is necessary as, when reclined, your feet are directed into quite a small cubby-hole towards the centre of the aircraft and you have to lie across you seat to get your feet in.  If the seat were any narrower I would not think that you would be at all comfortable.  The seat back flips forward to expose the mattress/bedding which is very good and overall the seating/sleeping is good but not great.  Etihad offer a more comfortable seat and sleeping experience.
To sum up - the best thing about SIA's business class was access to their excellent SilverKris Lounge in Changi Airport - so much better that the very tawdry and very ordinary Gold Kris Lounge.
Would I fly Business Class with SIA again? probably, but there are so many other (better) options now available for the sort of $$ that SIA expects - think Etihad, Qatar and the like.",positive

Getting each of these was like pulling a tooth. Information desk at Changi airport had no information when we arrived. UOB bank was charged with dispensing SIM which they ran out of.

1225,"Ridiculous Customer Service ""Enjoy complimentary rebooking for ALL TICKETS issued up to 31. December 2021"" . This is what Singapore Airlines advertises on their website. Well, it is not true !  When we changed (online not possible! ) our return flights (same flights, only 2 weeks earlier! )  and originally booked online with Singapore Airlines, we were charged extra. Asking why, they explained it with a different booking class..., on a flight to Singapore that was after all only about 10 % occupied, connecting flight from Singapore about 30 % occupied. After extra payment, new tickets were issued with a lower baggage allowance. Had to call them again, but you must know: The customer service is, if at all, almost not reachable by phone. On top of it, one suitcase did not arrive on time with our connecting flight.
Overall: Quite unprofessional service and defenitely one way to loose customers for the future.
Bye Bye Singapore Airlines.",negative
6154,If the world was run by Singapore airlines it would be near perfect We have travelled with low cost airlines in the past in the belief we were saving money however on this trip is did a quick cost comparison and found I wasn’t saving very much at all so I returned to Singapore airlines. What a relief!checking in is a breeze and almost a pleasure. All the staff whether ground or cabin are courteous and knowledgeable. But get this - we had a late departure from Hong Kong due to weather which gave us less than 20 minutes to make the connection in Singapore which was achieved by us running flat out through the terminal. We made it just as the gate was closing and as we sat on the plane we decided our luggage would arrive some time next week as there was no way they could have loaded it from one aircraft to the other in such a short time. On arriving in Melbourne there was our luggage on the carousel ready for collection - effortless efficiency in every way. Thank you and well done.,positive
6957,"Pleasant flight Seat 17A left hand window single on a Boeing 777-300ER.   Singapore staff are professional, use paper lists to write down passenger's orders.  On this leg I got the feeling those who were pushy got served first.  Again, I gave entertainment a miss - no idea how to operate it and staff seemed to think that pointing at a button was the total answer - not!  Food, cocktail and wine choices wonderful and I slept well on this long haul flight.",positive
1958,"Felt like the old days, friendly, relaxed, great service This flight was like a balst from the past. The cabin crew seemed to be really enjoying their job; the drinks trolley came by shortly after we left Tokyo and was quick and efficient. The real highlight was the Japanese dinner option, probably the best aeroplane meal we have had. And new release films.",positive
5149,"Great trip! Excellent business class service - unobtrusive, helpful & polite.  Great seating arrangement on the A380 with single seating in a type of cube arrangement along the window side of the plane, which made it quite private.. Ample room to stretch out flat & sleep.  Very quiet for an overnight flight.  The usual high level Singapore Air service",positive

8362,"Welcome to Business-Class  -  MA Spoiled it for me! I was actually underwhelmed; the Araliya lounge was small and a bit crowded, on there way out, and on the way in, the Silver Kris lounge was a bit less special than roaming outside, outside where there where massage chairs. And so much more to do. The last Business Class lounge we were in even had rooms that we could have cat-naps in. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I would have expected more from SQ which is a very, very good airline - especially since we were at its home base!",positive
9322,"Improved food and flight comfort on SQ31 San Francisco to Singapore Having flown this route a few times this year, can say it has improved food wise and comfort wise. Seated at 48K which has extra leg room but seat width restricted due to entertainment console in seat arm. Aisle access was supposed to be available but the passenger in front just blocked that off!. 
Flight time was 16.5 hours departing at 11a.m. local time in SFO. Lounge access for Star Alliance Gold is only United Club-the saddest and worse lounge for Star Alliance. Food choices limited, beverage limited, seating limited. 
Late lunch/early dinner served 2 hours into flight--which is tough if you planned on sleeping (to adjust to Singapore time which is exactly 12 hours ahead). There is ZERO chance of sleep in economy as service is LOUD. Managed to upgrade to business class for SG-Perth leg which was quiet and heavenly.
As noted over the past 9 months-cabin temperature is very warm. This can be good or bad-good as bones unfrozen, bad as not only are you bathed in old man's farts but also sweaty. Gross.
Food was so much better compared to last 18 months of flying Singapore Airlines ( I only fly Singapore Airlines for long distance). Make sure you order ahead of time vegetarian/muslim/kosher meals. You will be served about 30 minutes ahead of everyone else. It will be better and you won't be out of luck when they run out of your preferred option.
Amenities are good- even the blanket and socks for economy are comfy. Can't beat the weighted blankets in business though. 
Head on back fro snacks and water- the cabin crew are really good for that and will even make up pot noodles.
This was much better than my Premium Economy Singapore to London flight in June. for economy Singapore is 2nd best, the best would be Emirates. It is still a good flight. If you can, get business. It is way comfier.",positive

18,"Nothing special. I'd heard many good things about Singapore Airlines so was looking forward to travelling with them but was sadly disappointed. We flew economy in a 777 and although we paid for extra leg room it still felt very cramped. The seat was so uncomfortable, the noisyest flight I can recall ment there was no chance of being able to grab a couple of hours sleep but the worst thing for me was the entertainment screen was not working despite 2 resets I was left staring at the bulkhead for 13 and a half hours. The lead stewardess took my E mail address and promised compensation for the broken screen but a week on an I've heard nothing from them. Hardly one of the world's best airlines I'm afraid.",neutral

Lived up to expectations in terms of service and staff which was great and up there with the other good airlines we have used.  Had Airbus A380-800 on the Sydney - Singapore legs and Boeing 777-300ER on the Singapore-London segments.  The Airbus is far superior, larger and newer with better legroom for us.  Do not understand why we have the smaller plane on the longer segment.  Disappointing but would definitely use again.",positive

1116,"Very terrible check in personal and costumer service!!!! Singapore airlines refused my boarding today.

I was at Singapur airline check in desk around 40 minutes today and my check in was still not complete. 

I asked the check in lady two times ... do we need to hurry up because the flight is soon leaving, right? I did not got any answer from her and trusted she will know. The fact is that 4 ladis where standing behind the desk working on one check in and could not provid proper service so I could board my plain is unbelievable?!?!?!  35 minutes before my plane was leaving they said the boarding is closed. What??? 35 minutes is not enough time to go from the check in to the gate???

Through this inconvenience from Singapor Airlines i missed my connection flights from Jakarta to Singapor, from Singapor to LA, from LA to Mexico City from Mexico City to Huatulco!! 4 flights missed!!! 

After complaining with singapor airlines management today they booked me the same flight 24 h later but only to LA. I am having additional expenses: accomodation in Jakarta, food, I need to pay another plane ticket from LA onward and I am missing out all my meetings in the following day. 

A few hours after this inconvenience I found out from my travel agency that my flight was canceled by Singapor Airlines although the plane was actually leaving from Jakarta - just without me. Very weird, right?!

I am traveling all my life but such bad check in service, costumer service I never experienced before. 

First and last time booked with this Airline. Definitely not recommended to use Singapor Airline Service!!!",negative
6707,"Brilliant experience Booked extra legroom seats (41B and C) as my husband has long legs.
This was our second round trip experience of SA.  The stewards and stewardesses are handsome/beautiful to behold with smiley, welcoming faces.
Our seats were just by the entrance to the plane and next to a galley.
The standard of service was exceptional.  Nothing was too much bother and the food was wonderful and plentiful.
My only criticism was that my husband was served his special meal ( he is diabetic) first and I was served last of that sides service.  Surely it would not be too much to serve a meal to the accompanying passenger at the same time.",positive
2355,"Flew via Melbourne from Wellngton We flew Wellington - Melbourne, Melbourne - Singapore.  Usually from Wellington we have to fly to Auckland or Christchurch for our international leg.  Since I travelled the  Airline has put newer planes on the route which will be an improvement.  Our Wellington to Singapore leg was awful, the plane older and the entertainment system was so poor it wasn't worth watching.  That made for very long flights.
As always the crew were lovely and food pretty good considering.  Our Singapore to London flights were good because we were on a bigger and more modern plane.
We did a stopover on our way to the UK, taking advantage of the stopover holiday benefits which are good.  On the way home we had 13 hours in Signapore, with an early morning arrival.  The stopover would have been better placed on the homeward journey.",positive

The efficiency and service from the airline for a delay which they technically had no control over, is to be applauded.",positive

5666,"Singapore Airlines- Brisbane to Singapore Left on a guided tour to Vietnam with Singapore Airlines on 5-4-19. When it came time to bring around the meals it was discovered that Jill's dietary requirements ( Various allergies ) had not been passed on to the crew. 
After a brief, and cheerful, discussion the Chief Steward apologised. Jill generally carries some appropriate snacks for such occasions and as it was a relatively short flight it was no big deal.
Soon after, the Chief Steward appeared with a fresh omelette. Don't know how he managed it but Jill appreciated it just the same.
The aircraft had reasonable legroom,and the aircraft was clean.

896,"Perfect evening flight from MNL Check-in : At the dedicated Business Class counter. Quick without any waiting involved. Keep in mind the long queues at the entrance though ( Our flight was at 18:30 )

Security / Immigration : No separate queue / Fast-Track. Clearance was quick though.

Lounge : SilverKris Lounge
Well laid out , with excellent views of the tarmac. Great F&B options as well.

Boarding : A separate area reserved for premium passengers , but made no sense , nor was it being followed. Priority boarding was enforced though.

Seat / Layout : Our aircraft was the A350-900. Business Class is divided into 2 cabins ( 1 large , 1 small ) separated by a galley. The layout is 1-2-1 in a staggered sense , with some seats towards the aisle , and the others away ( more private ). The seats are very comfortable , and thankfully the footrest is straight , not angulated as seen in the A380.

Service : Very courteous staff , who ensured that the service throughout the flight was incredible , and personalized.

Food & Beverages : 'Book the Cook' was unavailable. Pre-selected meals from the in-flight menu. 'Pan fried mahi mahi' was decent . but the 'Pasta with meat balls' was horrid",positive

Their service and food is and has always been great , the planes are always clean and this time we had the pleasure of flying on the 1st of their new 787s  which was a great experience . The only small downfall was the legroom the seats are very comfortable but myself being rather tall always find this a bit of a problem .",positive
3393,"A great experience We took the flight from Delhi to Singapore and Visa-Versa. Both the time it was a great experience travelling with Singapore Airlines. From ground service till Cabin Service it was simply best. For us, the seats were comfortable. They provide all kind of amenities like a blanket, a pillow, earphones, earbuds etc. Cable staff were friendly and welcoming, and always ready to accede to your requests. Inflight entertainment was also excellent. As it is a Full-Service carrier, they offered complimentary Food and beverage as well. We got the option between Indian and Continental meal. I will suggest, post-booking the tickets, please update your meal preference so that they can arrange the same accordingly and you can enjoy your meal. They have multiple food options.

Few suggestions for Airlines.

1) Please make the TV screens angle adjustable so that any person can adjust the screen as per his/her need. Also, remote buttons are hard to press. Please replace those faulty remotes.
2) Add more collection in the Indian movies sections. 
3) I have booked 4 Indian Non-Veg meals, but both the time received only three as it was finished. Please have sufficient meals at least for those passengers who pre-booked their meals. 

Rest it was very good experience travelling with Singapore Airlines. In future, we would love to fly again with them because of their great hospitality.",positive

2154,"LHR-SIN-MEL-SYD-SIN-LHR One of the main reasons I booked Singapore Airlines was because they operate the new Airbus A380 on London to Singapore & Singapore to Sydney routes. They are supposed to have more leg room, back support, adjustable headrest with foldable wings.  I also paid a premium to fly this airline & booked direct with them. However I was very disappointed to be traveling on very old aged A380’s instead. No touch screen entertainment, old bucket seats not comfortable & to be honest these old aircraft’s need a total refurbishment. Where is the new A380 fleet?  Well out of 4 flights on A380’s we were lucky to experience the last flight on a new aircraft finally Singapore to London. On the positive side Food, service & cabin crew was absolutely fantastic.
Food & Beverage Service takes too long. 
23.45 take off, 01.00 still not a drink or food. Such late flight they should rush the service so the passengers can get some sleep. I also found no salt & pepper in food tray & if you don’t ask they won’t offer tea/coffee even there is a coffee cup on the tray & milk. 

If I have known that I was traveling such long distances in old aircraft’s, my choice of airline would have been different.",neutral
1370,"World class airline I wouldn't usually book Singapore Airlines knowing the fact that it would be expensive traveling with a world class airline. But with a bit of patience awaiting for promotions from Singapore Airlines, I was able to book a flight from Singapore to Manila and vice versa for about S$270. Not quite cheap but considering that this is a world class airline with meals and 30kg checked in baggage on the side, it's well worth the price. But that's not all, this is during the peak period of December holidays. The trip itself was smooth, once you have boarded and settled on your seat, the flight attendants will soon hand over a hot towel for you to freshen up for the trip ahead. The aircraft was a Boeing 787-10, which is quite new and a little bigger that the usual Airbus A320 that goes through this route via budget airlines. I was seated at the very end with only two seats and I was lucky enough the window seat was not occupied though I still choose to sit by the aisle. The good thong about this is you would be near the toilet if you need to go quite frequently which was my case as I had too much water to drink prior to my trip. Another advantage is that you'll be in the first row served with food. Entertainment was good, they have the latest movies in the entertainment console in each seat. All in all the money that I paid for was worth every cent and I would highly recommend if you can accommodate a bit more dollars on top of your usual budget air costs.",positive

486,"Excited about going on an A380-800 but the plane was already delayed. I was excited about going on an A380-800 for the first time as Id never flown in one before, however that was tainted by already receiving an email at 6am that morning to say that they had rebooked our onward connection from Singapore Changai to Brisbane international into a 12 hour layover as the flight out of JFK NY left 3hrs late and we wouldn't be able to connect to our original flight.
We checked in ok and got a 15 euro meal voucher each to spend at the airport for food due to the delay.
The plane came in to Frankfurt on the new scheduled time and was turned around quickly by the ground crew and we were soon boarding for our flight to Singapore. We had booked seats as I wanted to be able to see the engines and the seat was excellent for this. We booked seats 43A&B which were forward economy seats so we were the last group to board.
The seat was a standard economy seat with the only issue being a small metal box cutting into the footwell for seat 43A. Not much but just enough to be a pain.
I really enjoyed take off and landing with the view of the engines.
The service again from the Air Singapore crew was excellent. Very attentive and professional. The inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is excellent and has something for everyone. It was a 12hr flight which is long when flying in economy.
The A380-800 was very clean inside.
One thing I did note on the bottom level window seat was the bulkhead is about 9 inches away from the seat so it makes resting the pillow against the window impossible to sleep on. When on the A350's, the gap is better for this.
Still, an excellent flight and great service from the Singapore team. Although we had a delay, they had rebooked everything and informed us every step of the way and helped everyone make connections when the plane landed in Singapore. Still not a fan of 12 hour layovers though, but they did their best for us. Will definitely fly these guys again.",positive

However, I recently flew their segment with a technical stop in Canberra and I was confused why they needed to have all the passengers leave the plane just to set down or pick up more passengers. They should have explained the reason for the stop. It seemed like it was more than just to pick up passengers. Still, the remaining flight was top quality! Love it 💕",positive
9670,"Save for Business Class if you can. Absolute heaven.
After flying Singapore to Paris in Economy, the sheer luxury of the extra space in Business Class was pronounced.
After spending a few complimentary hours in the Singapore Kris Lounge at Heathrow, we were delivered to our boarding gate by buggy and ushered immediately to our seats (more like mini cabins). Champagne & orange juice were available, with drink order for after takeoff taken.
Just playing with all of the buttons and gadgets was fun, finding noise-cancelling headphones, a pack of slippers, socks, eyeshades and toothbrush, and a larger screen for watching the inflight entertainment.
The best bit, however, is the massive amount of room. No fighting with your neighbour for elbow room, no lack of room for your legs, and of course the whole 'pod' converts to a fully flat bed for a much better chance of sleep. Cushioning in the bed position is rather thin, but better than sitting up for 13 hours.
Dinner was served on real plates with real cutlery and glasses and never seemed to stop coming, with each course served individually, not all at once on one tray as happens in economy.
Service is provided quietly & competently, with ready assistance to set up the bed.
The cabin staff even use your name!
Longhaul flights are not fun, but business class makes the experience more enjoyable.

Only disappointment was the limited choice of up to date movies.",positive
3518,Disappointing! Very disappointed with amount of leg room compared to Air New Zealand who we had flown with from Auckland to Singapore.

3645,"Lapsing sometimes into the ordinary. I can't remember the flight number, but it was the 0720 from Changi.
It didn't start well after the Terminal of departure was changed from 3 to 1. The big problem with this terminal, is the gates have no bathroom facilities once you pass security.
As we are Kriss Flyer Gold members the boarding was fine and we were soon seated in a new kind of economy seat. They don't seem as deep as the previous ones, but in my opinion, were quite comfortable.
An added trial for the crew was the persistent turbulence for the first half of the journey and having to deal with passengers that think the seat belt sign doesn't mean them. This despite the entire crew being strapped in!
The meal was adequate and quite tasty, but due to the conditions, the tray remained on your table for a long time.
The meal on arrival has really deteriorated into basically a pie! Nothing else but a drink to go with it. Looking around the plane, there were an awful lot of them refused or left. I don't think it is adequate to dish up a dry pie in a cardboard box! It smacks more of Air Asia than a Premier Airline.
The crew were courteous and efficient, without being over friendly. Perhaps this is how they are told to behave.
Singapore Airlines is still one of the best, but cracks are beginning to show on some flights.",positive

3138,"Worst airline I traveled with this airline numerous times and I have never had good service. They are expensive, the luggage allowance is less than other airlines and the food is horrible. 

On one flight the staff didn't even serve me food. I was a  breasfeeding mother at that point which also meant my baby had less to drink that day. When I spoke to customer care they played it off as me being fussy over the food and dismissed my email. Hard to be fussy if you arent even served.

The check in staff is rude and don't seem to know what they are doing. 
 When I asked the flight attendant for warm water to feed my baby I waited 15min and she returned with  unwashed bottle and ice cold water. Everything seems to be to much effort for them. 

I am so tired of flying with an airline that treat you like they are doing you a favor. They seem to forget that their customers pay to be on their airplanes.

Had to travel to the Netherlands for a business trip. I have travelled on SQ before but that was a number of years ago.
I was pleasantly surprised by the content provided on the in-flight entertainment . Lots of movies; new and classics . Music content is enormous with a broad genre. There is also a vast selection of different news & documentaries available. Not to mention games for the kids, too...
Food; as with past experiences; is very tasteful & well portioned.

Cons:
- Was charged data roaming on the flight. Not the fault of the airline's; but would definitely appreciate more prominent ""data on board"" signage or even video instructions via the entertainment portal.
- Being an audio engineer, this is a pet peeve.... The quality of the provided ear buds is pathetic.
In the words of Caroline & Don Davies - ""If bad sound is fatal, audio would be the leading cause of death"" - And I certainly wouldn't want that... ;-)",positive
4043,"Very cramped and very hot I expected more. The lounge in Melbourne was pretty tired and needs a refresh. Seating was quite cramped compared to other business offerings. Also the seats need to be folded down which breaks up momentum when ready to sleep. Service was OK, but not over friendly. My colleague and I seated next to each other were served at separate times. No continuity. lounge in Singapore very good. My biggest gripe was the temperature on both flights. Roasting hot which made it very uncomfortable. If given a choice I would use others next time.",neutral

Good Indian vegetarian food available.
Attentive crew members.

1334,"Lovely customer service and quick refund:) I wanted to say thank you to Singapore airlines for a great refund experience. Straight after my flight was cancelled I was emailed with details on how to apply for a full refund. It was a quick and simple process which I wasn't used to for airlines! I called a month later to ask about the refund and a few days later had ALL my money back, a lot quicker than the 4-6 weeks they said it would take. Friendly and efficient. Hoping to fly with you soon!",positive
7962,"Great service and product Flew on the new first product. Service was amazing as usual, seat was good and the bed even better. A good first class product, highly recommended. Cabin is quiet and the new lalique amenities bag is great as are the pyjamas.",positive
4142,Time to Fly Traveled back on Airbus A380- the legroom was great. Both husband and myself are near the 6 foot mark and the seats were not sitting on the knees. The staff were great and the service was fantastic.,positive
2665,Long haul South Nothing was too much bother for the cabin staff and kept me well refreshed on all legs of my journey.Made the connections comfortably and the on board entertainment along with the comfortable seating and clean spacious cabin meant the journey was very pleasant given the distance traveled. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for anyone planning a long haul.,positive
3432,"Just so inconsistent... This was my second trip from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines this year and just like last time, it was a very inconsistent experience. The flights from Sydney - Singapore and back were like flying with an entirely different, budget airline. Old, grubby, cramped planes (seriously, WHEN are they going to retire or at least refurbish these horrible old B777s!? They are such an embarrassment for a supposedly world class airline!), food basically inedible and very minimal. At 170cm I'm of average height, yet spent the whole flights with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me. The European sectors were much better - new, clean A380s, much nicer food, a bit more leg room.

The staff were mostly pleasant, flights on time, boarding efficient, in-flight entertainment average. Either way, I'm going to choose a different airline next time.",neutral
3597,Great service in Singapore Airline I have been flying frequently with Singapore airline. Their flight attendants are always very courteous and friendly. Flight often departs on time. Hope they continue to keep up with the good service on board.,positive

5672,"Comfortable plane, great Service Very comfortable flight, toilets always cleaned and ready for use by the next passenger. Their experienced pilot gave us a good and restful comfortable ride, by respecting our private space and need for maximum rest. Enjoyed their good selection of cheeses. Had Superb spinach frittata for breakfast. And was treated to a Delicious hot chocolate made with milk. And my entire journey was made special by Marcella Stephany, one of the flight stewards who was amazingly wonderful in all ways! She was sensitive to my requirements, most polite, gentle and superb and serving from her heart, in her responses to requests. Truly the embodiment of Singapore Airlines’ philosophy of service excellence!",neutral
5565,Best flight experience Flew to Singapore & Back to New Delhi from Bangkok...most pleasant staff...guess the most comfortable economy seats...the food was very good(Indian)...in flight entertainment is excellent..be sure to take Kris flier membership to explore it to fullest...i booked 3 months in advance & almost saved 50%...truely a 5 star airline,positive

6565,When only the best will do I have only ever flown with Singapore Airlines as I find them to be the best whether it is Business Class or Economy they can never do enough for you.,positive
9383,"Good flights - very attentive and professional service. We recently flew from Sydney to Rome on Singapore Airlines. The first leg on an A380 was probably the best flight I have been on - helped by the fact that we had an empty seat next to us. The flight was so smooth my wife didn’t even realise we had taken off. The staff were excellent throughout the 8 plus hours. The second leg was on a smaller plane and wasn’t quite as good, although again, I couldn’t fault the flight crew. The only downside ( and the reason for the 8 rating) is the food. Like most airline food, it is fairly ordinary. Singapore is still a great way to fly!",positive
5429,"Not what it once was I agree with a previous review. It is still a first class airline but it is not head and shoulders above the rest as it used to be. We flew Sydney - Paris return, a total of four legs.
The food was just average and again we had to wait for trays to be cleared, difficult when you want to use the toilet.
The aircraft didn't appear to be new and one had a lot of rattles and noises. It looked as though the upholstery was parting company with the seat shell on one aircraft.
Generally the cabin staff were very good, but again not really any more special than other first rate airlines in my opinion. The toilets were always clean and tidy when I visited them. I haven't flown SA for a few years and I must say I was a little disappointed really.
I would fly with them again as long as the price is right as I don't believe that I would pay a premium just to fly with Singapore Airlines. It was still a pleasant experience flying with Singapore Airlines, just not the great one I was expecting.",neutral
8847,"Friendly crews  Had an awesome, safe and sound flight with Singapore airlines (SG 452). Clean restroom and cabin helpful friendly crews. Delicious foods. With some entertainment from the cabin. There are iPad that you can listen music,watch whole the time of movies while flying, and etc.  Thank you for bringing us joy in our trip.",positive
2418,"Good experience Check in was fast and friendly. That left us some time to explore the shops at Narita airport. Cabin crew was attentive and polite, and the food quite good. There was a good selection of movies to keep us occupied, and pretty soon, after a six-hour flight we were collecting our luggage and clearing immigration.",positive
4988,Premium economy is worth it The extra room in premium economy was totally worth it for me.  The seats along the windows had even more room than those seats in the middle of the cabin.  I had more room in the seat and leg room area.,positive
7878,Beware  Extra Leg Room Seats We always fly SQ and generally have nothing but praise but on this occasion we payed for extra leg room seats.  The seats were situated adjacent to one of the galleys and it was hectic.  This was a night flight and the lights of the galley were annoying and the constant movement of people meant no rest.  This of course is a case of poor choice on our part but my issue is that you pay extra for these seats and they provide you with overall less comfort then a standard seat.  So this rating applies to the seats and having to pay rather then the overall airline experience.,negative
3151,Comfortable flight Flight was very comfortable. With the Airbus 380 we had enough space for our legs even in the economy class. Also the multimedia was very nice. Service and food was great.,positive
1654,"A great way to fly  From check in to the farewell, the service was fantastic. 
The seats were comfortable and fair leg room. 
The food was great and regular water offered. 
The choice of drinks also good.

9357,"Disappointed I booked Singapore Airlines based on other people’s experiences and reviews.
My flight from Perth TO Japan was excellent but the flight FROM Japan to Perth was a disappointment. Vegan meals going to Japan we’re tasty but the return flights consisted of plain boiled vegetables for both the evening meal and breakfast. Yuk.
We had to change aircraft hubbing through Singapore and the last leg was in an old rattling aircraft. Not what expect from a “full service” first class airline.
Next time I think I’ll travel Cathay Pacific.",neutral
8244,"Still one of the best Our first flight on an A350 and the seating was excellent, both the ‘normal’ seating and the lay flat bed.  The plane was almost brand new so everything on board was immaculate.  

The check in ar Düsseldorf was seamless and the checkin staff were efficent and extremely pleasant.

As always the service on board was all one could ask for and again, as previously the food was excellent with a good wine selection.

Singapore never fail to impress and they are definitely up there as one of the leading aitrlines if not the best.",positive
7139,"Fantastic airline. A return flight from Brisbane to Bangkok for my annual holiday.
Departure and arrival times where good. In flight entertainment was fantastic although the audio on the return flight from Singapore was very loud even at the lowest level, plane looked rather new.
Easy check in at both airports. Check in and cabin staff where great.
Food was a little poor compared to past years, not all bad but the main meals where very below par.
Leg room in economy was ok, tall people might like to pay a little extra for more legroom though.
A solid 9/10 from me, lift your food quality for a perfect score .",positive
4893,"SQ324 Excellent This was our second leg of the flight from Auckland to Singapore and to Amsterdam. The service was excellent, we received priority boarding because we were travelling with kids.

The food was good (the wine was ok). The entertainment system excellent and user friendly. 
Overall, business class is worth the extra cost (comparing to other carriers) our mileage (if you choose to use mileage for an upgrade). I recommend Singapore Airlines highly, especially on long flights.",positive
5642,"Well oiled machine. Singapore Airlines have the customer service aspect down to a fine art. Hot towels for economy passengers are a bit of a rarity as are printed menus.
The plane on this leg was a rather tired 777. Attentive staff constantly offered water and juice through the trip and there was a snack bar to help yourself from down the back of the plane.
I was surprised by the excellent quality of the food. I wasn't expecting much from economy class food but it was really tasty. Very bravely, they served Brocolli as part of a starter and it was perfectly cooked. Even when I cook Broccoli it's tough or mushy.  They also have cracked serving bread that is edible.
Economy travel on 11 hour flights is more of an endurance test that a pleasure but Singapore does its best to make the experience as painless as possible.",positive
2121,"Family trip December Business class to Incheon. It was a morning flight. First time on the new plane. Find that the seat seems to be smaller compared to the ones I took previously. Still, the length and position of the leg room is not meant for people with slightly long legs and the slanted angle somehow is not good for long hours of rest should you have a long flight. But still cleanliness and service deserved a thumbs up.",positive
491,"Really disappointing - go BA Had heard great things but service and quality of seating far inferior to that of BA. Food terrible and don't believe it was any different to economy. Poor and slow service. No flight socks, eyeshades, etc. Would not recommend on the basis of this flight.",negative

334,"Racist staff My family and I flew from Jakarta,Indonesia to Mumbai,India. The plane was predominately full of Indians as we were on a flight to Mumbai. The Singaporean staff were curt to the Indians on the plane, and seemed to think they were superior to the passengers. It was clear racism. As and Indian American I have faced many racist situations ,yet this was one of the worst. As I was heading back from the bathroom, the stewardess was in the middle of the aisle, I politely asked if she could move as I needed to get to my seat since the seatbelt sign was on, she curtly replied, “Wait your turn” as she turned back around. It almost seemed as if I was the staff and she was the paying passenger. The very same lady decided to act in a rude manner towards me the entire flight, from meal service, and even where I got of the flight. The flight itself was 5 hours long, and was hard to endure with an arrogant staff. While the facilities on the plane were alright, I would not recommend Singaporean Airlines to anyone who wants a pleasant racism free journey to their destination.",negative

8457,"Avoid Singapore Airlines giving 0 frequent flyer miles on long-haul economy flights;use another on same route with 100%! I am a frequent flyer with Star Alliance and have purchased as many as 3 round-the-world (RTW) tickets each year in economy.Last year, Air Canada wrote the ticket but one long-haul sector with Singapore Airlines yielded 0 frequent flyer miles. All other airline sectors gave 100%. This year using the Star Alliance online tool, it was Lufthansa who wrote the ticket and I deliberately chose other airlines ... e.g. Air New Zealand for Singapore to Auckland sector. But when I needed to change the date of that flight... one of the flexibilities of RTW tickets...the direct flight on Air New Zealand had no availability and I was booked to fly from Singapore to Brisbane on Singapore Airlines and Brisbane to Auckland on Air New Zealand. On all other sectors of this trip .. about 33,000 miles..I received at least 100% distance miles. Not so on Singapore Airlines which uses a special booking class category that yields 0 points. Twice burned, there is no further incentive for me to fly on Singapore Airlines! Tell your travel agents to beware of the various economy booking classes on Singapore Airlines which award 0 points and take another carrier flying that same route with 100%.",negative

It almost felt like I had come to free buffet and riots could break out at any tine. If you expect premium pre flight experience Singapore airlines has totally lost it. 

Same applied to pre boarding experience (maybe my exp is limited to flights to India) 
The staff is rude and ill manners and security and boarding is like herding cattle in a barn. The holding area is cramped with barely 1 seat for 3 passengers.

I had heard a lot about SIngapore airlines and the experience. This is definitely closer to the worst performing airlines and not best.

We have to fly there, because there are programs and accommodation reservations, what we cannot and don't want to cancel! 
Since then, two weeks have passed, we wrote more emails, but besides the automatic replay and they we asked for the patinece, I didn't get any answer and solution about what happened.
We need this tickets, but the price now much higher, like when we bought it. 
It is becoming a nightmare! We are about to go, on holiday and have no tickets, but we bought it on time....

Japan SIA told my client no need to present the card. I tried to verify with SIA in Singapore but they said cc was needed. Japanese client checked again with SIA in Japan... no card needed. Back @ SIA Singapore & guy in charge writes, I MUST have the card to board. Finally, I'm told the client paid cash. AHH...cannot show cash. 6 years ago with SIA same problem and the cancelled my ticket and I had to buy a new one at 3 times the fee from their ticket counter to get on the plane.

Never had this problem with Emirates, Oman Air, Etihad, American, Delta, Malaysian Air, Garuda, Air France, British Air, Namibian Air, South African Airways, Air Israel or any other airline... just SIA. One problem ON the flight. I paid extra for a bulkhead seat, 41H flying out of SIN and 41C on the return. BAD SEAT! The seat selection map shows the aisles are straight. They are NOT. No TV screen in front of me... it's folded down on the side. The aisle makes a dogleg to the window side. My feet ended up in the aisle and I had to keep moving them because the crew had to pull the cart over my foot area and people leaving the premium economy to use the toilets behind me kept stepping on my feet... both coming and going to the toilets.

The price did not justify the service. The seat was so cramped I couldn’t sit with my knees together. The toilet stank before we even took off (men’s urinal). Pre dinner drinks don’t exist anymore (on any of the recent 6 Singapore flights we took this only happened on the last one) and it seems that the serving of alcohol is being scaled right down - a gin and tonic was almost too much trouble and not readily available. The food was generally terrible and again been scaled right back - terrible white rolls, ice ctreams for dessert or nothing, gluggy tough meat courses, no fresh fruit or eggs for breakfast. I used to look forward to having a relaxing drink and a meal on Singapore - not on these flights. The staff were generally snappy and it seems, over all that the focus has gone to more expensive seats.

Economy flight from Singapore to Melbourne was absolute torture. Incredibly cramped cabin, genuinely felt much worse than a Ryanair type configuration... simply not suitable for an 8 hour flight. Food was atrocious, completely inedible. Absolutely stunned they are charging top prices for this rubbish. Took a couple of budget Jetstar internal flights whilst in Australia and they put Singapore to shame.

I  had actually upgraded the long first leg, Manchester to Singapore to business class...food and service was top class for this and I actually found the seat pretty comfortable for sitting...but as you will read elsewhere, the bizarre angle of the footwell makes achieving a comfortable sleeping position nigh on impossible. If you're going to splash out you might aswell use Emirates or Qatar and get similar service but with a more practical bed.

Truly disappointing overall, cancelled my return flights and travelled back with Qatar. Never again SIA I'm afraid.",negative
2772,"Superb service We flew out at 9.30 am  bang on time. The cabin crew were fantastic extremely polite and ultra efficient. The onboard meals were excellent. As it was my mothers 80th birthday the crew surprised her with a cake with a candle, sang happy birthday and gave her a small gift. How very thoughtful. I would recommend this airline to everyone.",positive

1087,"Cancelled flight without notice Letting other travelers know to avoid Singapore Airlines after they cancelled one leg of my flight without any kind of notification. Now, 48 hrs away from travel date and school holidays starting, I have little chance of organizing an alternative. That's right, after hours on the phone they have no help/replacement and urge me to cancel the whole flight instead. Even though flights are available on their website - it is almost as if they would rather resell my ticket.
I booked the trip early November last year and expected disruptions. Sure enough, two of the six flights were affected by changes which resulted in longer layovers - this is what I am prepared to accept. However, to leave me high and dry just hours away from the trip, no notice and no help is unacceptable.
I have sent three messages to Singapore Airlines via their precious web form: no response; wasted time on the useless chat bot, can't open my booking online as they simply say 'to get in touch with an SA office'. Plus several calls and when I finally got through it became apparent operators are trained to deflect, not help.",negative

7177,"Worst Experience Ever, Unlike The Usual Experience This is the worst experience that I have had with Singapore Airlines or any other Airlines. I have been part of the Travel Trade for over 25 years and have always vouched for Singapore Airlines. I never expected such carelessness & casual attitude from Singapore Airlines.

My bad experience started with the Singapore Airlines office in Ahmedabad. They personally know me as well as our company for over a decade now. We have been giving them business for almost 2 decades. Since, I was traveling myself, I requested for certain good seats, if possible. However sometimes the Airlines sell these seats (emergency row seats with more legroom) and hence I had only requested them to keep a small message in their airline system to allocate these seats to me if they are not taken till last minute. They promised the same but never did anything. In fact they blocked 2 seats for me & my wife on two separate rows !!!

I had selected special meals when I booked the tickets, almost a month in advance. It is also printed in my tickets - AVML meals. However when we boarded the aircraft they had no instructions about our meals ??? We are strict vegetarians and hence we said that we will not eat in this case. Later a junior air hostess came to us and told us that they have some different kind of vegetarian meals for us. She told me that some other guests refused to eat their meals and hence she was obliging us !!! 

I do not understand if the staff is trained to present the matter in better way ? We felt like beggars who were given food because someone else decided ""not to eat"". This could have been simply presented in a better manner 

I also don't know if the staff is trained to identify between veg. and non veg. food ??? They gave us lamb meat and presenting the same as vegetarian food. When I opened the food box, i realized that it was not vegetarian food and hence I asked the air hostess again to re-confirm. She showed the label on the box, which she claimed to mention that it was vegetarian food. However she was not ready to see the actual food.....only looking at the label and insisting that this was vegetarian food. I was still skeptical and hence I requested to call her supervisor. It took quite some time and in the meantime, my wife already started eating the food, trusting her word. The supervisor came and immediately understood the matter. He took both the food packets and confirmed after some time that it was lamb meat. My wife being highly religious and strictly vegetarian felt sick and was deeply hurt emotionally. She could not forgive herself for trusting the airline staff...........they later apologized several times but the damage was already done beyond their imagination.

We later tried to sleep to forget the entire episode. However it seems that blankets given by the airline staff were not properly washed or had some kind of bugs. Both of us 8-10 dark red rashes on our legs. Something bit us or there was something in the blanket which was allergic and we started to itch like crazy in both the legs. My wife was also bleeding in couple of places when we landed at Singapore airport.

These 3 incidents made it the worst experience of our life time. This review is based on my last experience and hence cannot to generalized for all other trips.",negative

The onboard was certainly better with better headsets, choice of meals,= & a whole bottle of water to myself. Plus SQ usually keep to their flight schedule  tightly.

In all flights, I expected a meal or a snack more. My seat from Brisbane to Singapore was quite uncomfortable. 

Wifi on the way back didn't work because apparently krisflyers members don't get complimentary wifi anymore, although their app says they do. When I told the crew, they told me the app was out of date and they didn't really help nor offer alternatives.

At Brisbane airport I waited 1.5 hours to check in, and the app didn't let me check in online.

The app also doesn't really work, it's slow and it's very messy with a lot of hidden pages that are not east to find.

Lastly, Singapore airport is so bad. At 6am only a couple of cafes open (waited 25 minutes in a line to get a cappuccino) and not much space to sit.",negative

Told it would be six weeks for a refund. Received confirmation on email. 

Have chased numerous times since and been told it was a delay with my bank. Having spoken with my credit card company, they've received no funds. 

The credit card company have refunded the original booking fee, but nothing from Singapore whatsoever. They're keeping customer money and not even acknowledging they're doing anything wrong - this is an illegal practice. Book elsewhere!",negative

I flew Prem Eco so certainly harder than flat beds for this long trip - but seat was ok not too much of a problem. Bits of tech didn't work though and some things hard to find. The instructions are online - and you have to register and perhaps pay to get online...its all to much of a fiddle so did not bother.

He could also not access his baggage so literally only had the clothes on his back. Staff were rude and unsympathetic even though it was not his fault.

8793,"Very Caring Cabin Crew and Excellence in Service in Sky Boarded for the 1st time a morning flight from Singapore to Shanghai. Normally I like to take midnight flights so that the day is not waste sitting on flight during working hours.
This A380 aircraft had the new Business Class Seats which are new on this sector. The seats were same Broad seat with lots of space for sitting but for sleeping you still need to sleep at an angle which is awkward and not a very comfortable position to sleep. The layout of the Business Class on Top Deck  was 1-2-1. The Center seats had a divider which can actually be pulled up and down to make it 100% private seat or if you are travelling with someone can be pulled down completely till the seat level giving it a feel of a joint cabin. The idea is nice when you are travelling with companion as this makes the whole cabin very cozy. The seats are all trimmed with Dark Beige/ Brown leather and had every possible thing a traveler would need. Proper storage area, charging points, headphone and lights at appropriate location made the cabin very comfortable for users. 
The Service was as expected by the Cabin Crew who kept their meal services very professional and as per customers request. This being a day flight, the entire time, the crew were busy in Service and from Champagne to Tea was served at a push of a bell.
Overall this cabin is better and more functional then the old designed cabin of A380 which SQ was using when they launched the new Business Class. However the sleeping angle is not very comfortable, even though the duvet, pillows and blankets are top notch quality.",positive

Singapore - Christchurch  17.12.19 SQ 4295

Dear Mr or Madam,

Electronic Check-in at Bangkok:
It didn’t works.

Check-in Bangkok:
The Singapore Airline employee didn’t know that Swiss citizen don’t need a Visa for New Zealand.

Check-in Singapore:
Your employees were only an unreasonable demand. My partner and I had to wait over half an hour until they started with our tickets. Then the 1. employee, a man, gave our tickets further to a lady. I told her our continuation flight to Christchurch would be in 1 hour and she should now print out the boarding passes. She claimed my name is written wrong, even though the names on the tickets and the Travel Itinerary was written correct. She worked very slowly and called very long with an other persons. The same „game“ happened with the visa for my partner, even she could show it. Then we had to run 15 Min to A21 to get the plane.

Flight Singapore to Christchurch:
was good.

I don’t know what kind of education your employees have. In any case we cold this slowdown strike and plainly not the best service.

Yours sincerely

6988,"Return flight cancelled with no notice, no refund, call centre no help First time I've ever left a bad review:  
The email below and the title say it all- still unresolved after 1 month & 5 days, £600 lost- in essence stolen, with the cancellation of a return flight, no notice or valid reason given.

Customer services are very willing to talk, provided you wait for them to call back at an unagreed time.
Really wasn't expecting such hideous service, and theft, from a normally highly rated airline

Numerous proven lies, and excuses- now have the choice of writing this off, or going to a solicitor.  

Transcript form email below- 1 month , and circa 10 calls after flight was cancelled:

I need to discuss please:

1) why the return flight was cancelled without being informed- I found out by accident on December 26th-  this has taken 4 weeks to get nowhere

2) why I was told that by yourselves that the booking agent cancelled the flight, when in fact Singapore airlines cancelled the flight

3) why the first supervisor dealing with this committed to getting back to me by Friday 28th December, and did not.  In fact the commitment was never met- NO MISSED CALLS

4) why I was told there were no longer any spare seats on the plane for the cancelled ticket, even though online, both Singapore airlines and 3rd parties showed plenty of availability

5) on the day of the flight, I flew alone without my partner, and ... there were at least 5 seats unfilled  (I can guess the official answer to this)

6) Why it takes so long for you to get back- I think I am still owed a return call from the 2nd supervisor I spoke to, after the first did not return my call

7) why nobody in your organisation transfers details of this case to the person subsequently calling- the result of this is a large waste of time for all concerned

8) linked with question 7- why nobody in your organisation is able to progress this internally between calls and emails- it's a complete internal comms failure and massive customer disappointment.

9) Why was a return flight offered on 8th January, with a supplement that was never disclsoed,  which I had already said was too late and never agreed to- it would have resultant in circa £1200 in cheap hotel fees and lost income.  AT NO POINT DID I AGREE TO THIS",negative

No a word from the airline re apology etc.
Will never use Singapore Airlines again.  They are apparently in deep economic trouble which is ONLY due to poor customer service/ management and NOT because of Covid, world current economic climate etc.",negative

4319,"Absolutely atrocious customer service experience Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn’t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn’t possible (hello I’m trying to give you my money)! 
Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport and after being flushed by this too and fro at check in I didn’t bother to check the seat allocation on the 2nd leg which didn’t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, and this helpful assistance then was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. If going Aus to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers.

5961,"Service par excellence  Our last flight of our holiday, SQ322 Singapore to London. An organised airport is probably the best way to describe Changi. Just two people ahead of us at check in; extremely efficient and polite staff there to help with the process.
Had already been to the GST refund service, which, if GST refundable items are in your hold luggage and there’s a spot inspection, must be done prior to check in. Security check was slightly different than in Europe, as in the physical body scan and cabin bag search is done at the boarding gate. Once thru passport inspection, it’s into the retail, lounges and dining experience that puts Changi above so many other airports. Singapore Airlines Business lounge was pretty hectic, as usual. Decent variety and quality of food and drinks. Went thru for boarding as soon as flight showed as it’s quite a long trek to the B gates where flights to the UK usually depart. Absolute chaos at the gate; staff seemed over critical and pedantic. Lots of agitated parents, sweating travellers and crying children for the 23.45 departure.
Once onboard, in to the upper deck business class area, it seemed a different world. Calmness and serenity oozed from every smile and gentle word of the cabin team. No sooner were we all seated, hot towels to all to remove the sweaty stress of check in and boarding. As soon as they were cleared away, our pre take off champagne or soft drinks arrived. No delay in takeoff, we were soon airborne. Next came the dinner orders, had we preordered? Oh yes, just to confirm that you still require the lobster Thermidor? White wine with that? Champagne? Red? Soft drinks? Nothing was ever too much effort or a problem for this team. They all worked so hard, so together, so effortlessly. Whilst eating a superb lobster Thermidor, a film from the huge selection was in order, along with a glass or two of bubbles. Meal cleared and following a quick visit to the restroom, I came back to my seating pod to find that my lay flat bed had been prepared for me, complete with duvet and pillows. Plenty of leg room and could lay 100% flat! During our 14 hour flight back to London the cabin team were constantly on the go. Had a good three or four hours solid sleep before being shaken from our slumbers by air turbulence. Shortly afterwards, once back on a level flight path, we (husband and I) were approached by the cabin team, all smiles, despite the hour. ‘We believe it’s your wedding anniversary today’ they said in unison. ‘Sorry we could not upgrade you to first, but as you know (well, I did as I’d tried for the surprise upgrade at check in) all the suites are full, but as it’s been our pleasure to serve you on this flight, we have a bottle of champagne from first, plus a few gifts for yourselves and your grandson who you spoke about earlier.’ We were then given a carrier bag of goodies along with a beautiful card and bottle of champagne. 
Breakfast followed shortly after accompanied by our champagne, then our decent into London. 
An amazing flight and excellent service 
Thank you all!",positive

3423,"Nightmare experience with a flight journey operated by Singapore Airlines/ Silk Air A flight journey of 22 hrs 35 minutes involving a single stop, became a 46 hrs 22 minutes involving 3 stops eventually. 

Our original flight was from Hyderabad to Seattle via Singapore.
* Hyderabad -> Singapore: Silk Air
* 3:15 layover in Singapore 
* Singapore -> Seattle: Singapore Airlines
Total journey time: 22 hours 35 minutes

The initial flight from Hyderabad -> Singapore operated by Silk Air was delayed by more than 3 hours and 25 minutes, and hence our entire flight needed to be rebooked. No one gave us a specific reason why the flight got delayed, except the statement: ""the incoming flight got delayed"".

So the new itinerary that was booked for us was:
* Hyderabad -> Singapore: Silk Air
* 8 hrs lay over in Singapore 
* Singapore -> Hongkong: Singapore Airlines
* 1 hr stop in Hongkong, where we had to deplane and go through security checkin again.
Hongkong -> San Francisco: Singapore Airlines
* 2 hrs stop in San Francisco where we had to finis our immigration, customs, and then go through the security again.
San Francisco -> Seattle: United
* Here, due to the incompetency of Silk Air/Singapore Airlines staff, United refused to board us (18 passengers) as the tickets were not be ""endorsed"" correctly, even though our baggage got into transported in to the plane, and they had enough seats for all of us.

Finally, some of us got rebooked to a 05:30 flight and some of us to a 06:35 flight in the morning, where most of us spent the night in the Airport.",negative

What’s the point in providing contact information if the company chooses not to communicate with the customers in case of cancellation?

209,"Poor luggage service We flew with Singapore airlines from Copenhagen to Singapore, then from Singapore to Cairns on a Sunday. One of our luggage was lost. At Cairns airport, we have been told not to worry : when the luggage would be found, it would be delivered to us, wherever we may be. We insisted on the fact that we were on a 3 weeks road trip and would be moving every day, a little further to Sydney, but the staff at the airport reassured us they would send the luggage wherever we may be. 

We had a first call with an employee of Singapore Airlines, named Suzan, on Monday, saying that the company lost the luggage. She promised to call again the next day to inform us about the ongoing investigation to find it. We insisted again on the fact that we were on the move and Suzan said it wouldn't be a problem to send the luggage at a specific address.  

Unlike what was promised, we had no news on the next day. We then tried to reach Singapore Airlines on the next day, without success. That’s indeed when we found out that the number she used to call us was only one way: we couldn’t call it, only it could call us. Suzan finally called back on the evening of the Wednesday saying that our luggage was found.  

When we said that we would be in Ingham the next day, we were answered that it was too far to deliver the luggage! We were very surprised by this answer and started arguing on that topic, since we've been told the exact opposite since the beginning. When we asked if there could be a compensation linked to the loss, Suzan laughed at us, which we found very disrespectful. She even ended up hanging up on us!  

As we were wondering about what just happened to us (maybe it was the “Australian way” to deal with customers), another employee of the company called us back right away. We then found a compromise: since we were passing by the city of Innisfail on the next day (Thursday), we agreed to meet a courier there to get our luggage back. We gave our itinerary of the next days: after visiting the falls of Milaa Milaa and Elinja, we would be heading to Mamu Tropical Skywalk. We were almost sure not to have phone reception there and informed them that we would only be reachable when arriving closer to Innisfail, around 12 (lunchtime), time at which we agreed to meet the delivery person. 

The driver was supposed to have been given our contact details and to call us when leaving Cardwell in the morning to set up a meeting point in Innisfail. We arrived at 11.30 AM in Innisfail and then waited for the driver’s call to head up to a specific meeting point. But we received no call, and we waited for 1h30 in Innisfail for the driver to call us. We even tried to call Singapore Airlines, but every person we were speaking to had no idea of what the situation was, neither who to re-direct us too, they simply advised us to send another email. Since we had to be in Ingham at the end of the day (we had a hotel reservation there), we couldn't stay any longer and had to move. During our trip to Ingham, we took time to write an email to the email contact we had received in Cairns to explain the situation. We had Wifi that night and the next morning but received no answer to our email. At that moment we were very stressed because we had no idea what could have happened to our luggage. 

The next day, Friday, we had to reach Townsville because we had a ferry booking to go to Magnetic Island. When we were on Magnetic Island (with poor reception), we received a call at 11 AM – the exact time he was supposed to call us the day before.

What happened during that call was beyond disrespect. The person pretended that he tried to call, and email us the day before without success. He even mentioned having sent at least 10 text messages to both our numbers. Which is very strange because we had reception for sure from 11.30 AM, since we managed to contact Singapore airlines helplines ourselves. We received no text message nor email! He also said that since he couldn't contact us, he went up to Mamu Tropical Skywalk and consulted the register (that everybody is supposed to sign but we never were asked to at any time) to find out we never went there. We were so shocked because it meant that he was calling us liars. We went to Mamu Tropical Skywalk, we have pictures of the place and we have hotel reservation in Yungaburra and Ingham to prove our itinerary too. So we can’t understand why he would use this excuse.

On top of that, he said that he had money compensation with him, but since we didn’t show up in Innisfail, he wouldn’t give us the money anymore. Which means that since this day, we didn’t receive the compensation mentioned. And to finish the call, the driver informed us that we had no other choice than going to Townsville's airport to collect our luggage in the afternoon, otherwise, they wouldn’t take care of our file anymore. So in the end, the promise to deliver the luggage wherever we were was never met. 

We were so angry and frustrated during the call, that we stopped arguing and just wanted to get the luggage back not to waste our holidays with stress anymore. Another really strange thing: following this call, we both received a text message from him, from Suzan and also an email to confirm where the luggage would be sent, and we received all text messages, calls and emails sent at that time on both phones. We wonder why we didn’t receive anything the day before.

To sum up, it took Singapore Airlines 5 days to get us the luggage back. We received only 150 Australian Dollars to cover this loss, which was clearly not enough to cover 5 days of clothing / hygiene product / snorkeling equipment / ... that was in the luggage. We waited 1h30 in Innisfail for nothing. We had been charged for international calls with both our phones several times due to the poor communication of both companies. We had suffered a great deal of stress and frustration, we had been laughed at and disrespected and we had been called liars!",negative
9734,Great Service! The airbus A350 is really good. Seats are quite good. The entertainment is also good with a good variety. Food is good Service is excellent.,positive
5355,Still good tho minor issues Flew on the 777 and 380. Enjoyed the 380 more for its legroom. However the audio on the entertainment system needs balancing as the announcement by crew is much too loud,positive

6508,Very efficient Singapore Airlines crew are always very pleasant and happy to help you.  We were lucky to secure seats with more leg room (at a further cost) which was great on such a long flight.  The cabin was clean and kept clean constantly by the crew.  The toilets were checked by the crew very frequently.  Food was good.,positive

967,"No Food for 9 Hours We flew Singapore Airlines in 2018 in Premium Economy and I found it overall a good experience. However, this time the experience was a little disappointing. In 2018 we had been offered an aperitif before our meal. Not this time. I had expected the food to be between Economy and Business quality; but no, definitely the same as Economy. In fact the staff almost threw the food at us - dessert served about 2 minutes into eating the main course. The worst thing was - on a 12 hour flight - we were given a meal then NO FOOD for about the next 9 hours when breakfast was served. We were so hungry I went to the back of the plane and begged some snacks.
Liked the extra space and the better headphones, but will not be using Singapore Airlines again. The accountants have moved in and a previously semi-luxurious experience is now very much an economy affair. Emirates next time I think.",neutral
7365,"A350-900 Business Class Singapore to Adelaide Just experienced the New A350-900 Business Class. The Seating and space is First Class almost as big as Emirates First Class Suite but without the Bling Bling Gold and Wood grain. Very Spacious great onboard entertainment. Food was great as always with Singapore have flown the same route many times in A330 which were old and getting tired this is a big step up.  Only negative is (but some may like) is that its very private and High seating but you can't really view anybody or any distance in front of you or behind so its like your in a private cocoon.

A big mention to Allison the Singapore duty manager at Adelaide she sorted out a very stressful few days regarding my Wife's Kris Flyer Account that was suspended due to a glitch. 17 Phone calls to Kris Flyer in Singapore everyone making promises but no one coming through it wasn't until last day that my wife even knew she had a return flight! Shame on you Kris Flyer appalling for a world class airline.

Allison sorted and did things outside of the Square and above and beyond her duties. I shouldn't have had to go through Australia or Adelaide to sort it but was left with no Choice if we didn't my wife would be stuck in Malaysia as account unlock didn't come through until 6 days after return flight.

But this review is about the flight not the Airline or Krisflyer. Hence 5 Star",positive

4582,"Meet expectation The boarding procedure was well organised and hence there is no bottle-necked jam. I felt there are enough cabin crew on hand to assist the passengers, hence the smooth boarding. Well, the food are acceptable. The more experienced cabin crew are able to engage the passengers and do pay attention to the passengers' needs. I only find one younger crew member that seems a little stress and she just ""shoved"" the food and ice-cream to the passengers (It was a full flight), not like the more experienced ones who seems to offer rather than just put it down for the passengers.   I believe with a little more time, the particular cabin crew should be able better herself. One more thing, the safety video is very innovative and engaging. Overall, I have an enjoyable flight.",positive
9863,"Best economy class I have taken a lot of other economy class flights and by far the best is Singapore Airlines. They have wide seats than most economy seats that I can put the pillow on my side, and their pillows are softer and fluffier that other economy class pillows, and not feel squished in my seat. They also have longer leg room than other economy class seats. The window seat person can access their seats without the aisle and middle person getting up. Isn’t that amazing? The entertainment is also better, with bigger screens and a wide selection of entertainment to choose from. This is where I watch the movies that I missed. The food is unbelievably palatable, not dry and tasteless. The bread is soft and chewy, just how I like it. I always look forward to the ice cream for dessert. The economy class flights of Singapore Airlines is comparable, if not better than the business class seats of other airlines. And I have taken several business class flights for comparison. My next goal is a business class flight on Singapore Airlines.",positive

1184,"Worst service ever I am very very very upset with Singapore airlines and it's staff. The treatment my mother and I have received at the Auckland airport from Linda Gu and Laura Yip was beyond disappointing. We have everything in order for my mother to travel to Malaysia vis transit in Singapore today at 1.15am. They made us wait at the counter standing for 2 hours while they went back and forth wondering if my mother held a valid visa. I have advised them I have confirmation from immigration prior to the booking of the flight to ensure everything will be done smoothly. They we unsure and kept snapping pictures of my mothers visa and sending it via WhatsApp to God knows whom to enquire if it's acceptable- is that standard process? Snapping pictures of personal identification /passport and forwarding then on an unsecured platform?. They made us wait until the last 10 minutes and denied her boarding getting an executive decision from the manager NOT Malaysian immigration, who I have just gotten off the phone with and they have confirmed that the visa IS valid and she IS entitled entry into Malaysia. I am unable get in touch with anyone from your contact center to have this matter looked into as they have wrongfully denied my mother boarding. This has given us so much stress and anxiety and this is so appalling for what is touted to be a world class airline! If they had told me upfront that they will not be boarding her as they are unsure and given us some notice we could have gotten immigration on the phone and done something. Instead they waited untill the last moment and just walked away. This is beyond belief",negative
73,"Experienced warmth n care  when I was unwell While flying Singapore  Airlines..I experienced  a very good service from all the staff.They were so polite and always had a smile .
I want to especially  mention one particular  air hostess..Her name is Penny.
After  I boarded my flight I began to feel unwell..I started getting a migraine ..a very throbbing pain in my head and even vomiting...I was not in a position  to turn my head or even speak.. 
Penny noticed this and gave me comfort without  even asking for it..she gave me warm  water and I asked her for a headache  pill.....

They also know how to greet the passengers when the passenger were sleeping. 
I also like the food they, eventhough I didnt take all the sidedish because its too much. 

Beside the food, what matter most in long haul flight is the entertainment on board. SQ has so many variation of movie and I really love it. 
If you take young kid with you, there’re some movie and games for them to play too.

Overall, I really satisfied with the service and I would like to fly another trip with SQ.",positive
778,"very good experience We flew Sydney to Copenhagen via  Singapore in Premium Economy . We paid for extra leg room seats to provide extra comfort to stretch out and this was worthwhile. Premium Economy  seats are definitely wider and more comfortable than economy although still somewhat lacking in comfort padding. Having the option of book the cook where one can choose pre described dishes in advance is an advantage. I did feel that the Book the cook choices were somewhat limited  although they were tasty and adequate. 
Service was very good - attentive, polite  and efficient.  Crew came through many times with water through the flight not just  at set meal times and they were very responsive to calls in between.The planes were well maintained and clean and the toilets appeared to be serviced during the flight.   Having to walk through several sections to get to the toilets in economy was a nuisance but there seemed to be adequate facilities for a full flight. 
There is a general feeling that the crew are working together and information provided from the cockpit was efficient and informative. 
All in All we were satisfied with Singapore Airlines and would continue to use it as our preferred airline.
I FIND THE 5 STAR RATING BELOW RESTRICTIVE.  I WOULD PREFER TO RANK GOOD not AVERAGE OR VERY GOOD",positive

My partner is gluten free and it seems if one has ""special"" dietary requirements they are sat in the front row.  This is ideal as there is miles of leg room and no problems getting up for a stretch. And, the meal looked Ok to me ! The service is so much better than Qantas and not quite as good as Virgin.

714,"Vomit covered seat and floor, causing us all to get Gastro! We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. 

When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters chair was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit.

All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet.

I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. 

I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight.

We then of course all began vomiting the day after the flight, having been sat in clearly a gastro covered area.   Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled.   This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! 

I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. 

I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing.  I emailed several times, nothing.  I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers.  They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened.

So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue.  I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying ai freshener over it for us.  I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would.  The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened.  

 It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute  denial that it even took place.  Had I of known they had not logged my complaint on the flight, I would have asked fellow passengers for witness statements - but who would ever imagine they would need to that! 

Plus it has taken 3 months for them to look into this for me!!

We will never ever fly Singapore airlines again.",negative
1347,"Handling of COVID situation appalling I thought we were making a safe choice booking flights with Singapore Airlines in January before COVID blew up.  However, on reflection I will not use them again.  We are due to fly in 5 weeks time, which we obviously will not be doing, and they dont want to release any flight schedules or provide credits to people who booked before COVID.  Never get a real response from a person, just the same copy paste reply saying they will review their schedules and to keep checking....schedules make no difference to us, we wont be going on our holiday regardless.  Expected more from this world renowned airline.  Really disappointed.",negative

8980,"Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines, is it worth the price? Recently flew premium economy on Singapore Airlines on an Airbus A350-900. An overnight flight.
Seat configuration on this aircraft is 2, 4, 2. in premium economy. 
We have flown economy with Singapore Airlines numerous times and have been very happy.  Decided to treat ourselves and go Premium Economy. This was a huge disappointment!!  
We were seated in the centre group of 4 seats. Found the seating extremely cramped and really no better than economy. We had expected slightly more space in this class. Perhaps the 2 window seats may have felt less cramped. 
Food was nice but nothing special. 
Service was efficient but no better than economy. In fact there was no special service at all in premium economy. 
This is definitely not worth double the price of an economy ticket on this airline. 
Would definitely not recommend Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines. The space in the centre row needs substantial improvement!  Suggest configuration should be 2, 3, 2   NOT 2 4 2. 
Not looking forward to return flight",neutral

3008,"Enjoyable Flight but Reservations on Silverkris Lounge Offerings and Hanakoireki The Silverkris Lounge in Terminal 3 certainly is in need of some sort of upgrading and improved of F&B services. The offerings seems to get getting very limited and boring, and there wasn't even 'live stations' at time of visit. Since it is crowded, perhaps this is why the not so exciting offerings during lunch. Nonetheless, still good with premium items like TWG tea etc. 

On the flight itself as this was a daylight, around 6hours plus, hence, have more time to experience the service on board the Dreamliner (comparing to previous BKK trip on the same aircraft). 

Food & Beverage: 
Interestingly and again, no satay as canapes:(. Think is just me. Not from Sydney, not to Osaka:(. 
As business class passenger can choose their inflight meals prior, and hence, went for the famous Hanakoireki  option. Presentation wise was good, but taste very interesting with most items in cold/room temperature and acquired taste. Was not very satisfied though but it's must try (the return leg from Osaka is much better though). Would probably select some other book the cook meals next time or try their latest Keisuke ramen offerings. 
Also noticed the cocktail selections seems to be reduced as I wanted to try a few from other flights I saw. Nonetheless, still good. 

Comfort 
As per last review, the seat is pretty comfortable and good legroom. Though no bedsheets or amenity kit given for this day-flight (not even the midnight ones). 

Service
Good in general. Stewardess by name of Veera was friendly and engaging. 
The inflight Manager, obviously someone very senior was quite interesting in the sense that throughout the flight, he did not address business class passenger by their surname and service was sort of jaded. Though not rude or whatsoever, but you can tell he has been doing this for 20, 30 over years and seems to be going some form of motion, like offering chocolates just zooming right in front of your eyes etc. Bless him.",positive

My flight was all ""confirmed"" on my Singapore airlines account.  Not even 24 hours later, I received a call and a guy advised that I was bumped off my flight, which was only 48 hours before I was meant to fly off. They then advised the next available flight will be in 2.5 weeks..... this was not an option for me as I need to get home for work.

3932,"You get what you pay for. I haven't reviewed Singapore Airlines in a while. I recently went on a business class flight to Tokyo and back from Singapore. The flight was almost 7 hours long. The cost of the flight is not cheap in comparison to other airlines but SQ offers much more. Their seat size is huge compared to other airlines business class. 

This trip I found that SQ has removed all their novelty gifts for business class and first passengers. I actually enjoyed receiving a little gift from them even though its probably already paid for in the cost of your ticket but it was nice to receive a perfume or something or rather. They have just removed that element completely. My husband who is a frequent flyer says they removed it a while ago. 

I also found service was just average. The staff on the airline I went on on both ways did their job as much as was required from them. I didn't get the extra conversations, the small talk that I used to get on their airline. When I entered the plane, the staff who I passed greeted me and I went to my seat. After that I only saw staff members if it was time to serve a drink or dinner. I remember a time when a staff or two will strike a short conversation with you making you feel a lot more welcome. Maybe it was just my luck, but I felt you can take service to a whole new level with a bit of conversation.",positive

6182,"A bit disappointed but not unpleasant  Ok so we paid to have exit row extra legroom seats - we were next to the toilets which wasn’t the end of the world, because the TVs come from between the seats during take off and landing there is no entertainment available.
The extra leg room was great!
Unfortunately upon take off we were the last to be served food so of the 3 choices we were told we were having beef, drink service was hit and miss, my wife said staff seemed to ‘look busy’ to avoid getting drinks. When the snacks came round as a bank of 3 chairs we were basically given 3 items between us - 2 crisps and a sandwich. They did to be fair come around after they had finished elsewhere and offered us another item.
The ice cream was a similar story being told they had run out but finding what I suspect was the ice cream from either premium economy or business which took about 15 minutes to thaw enough to tackle and served in a nice china bowl! This ice cream was top draw I have to say!
Staff were friendly enough and quick with a smile. There were earphones provided and hot towels at the beginning and end of the flight.
I had expected a great flight and paid extra for a seat that had the bonus of leg room but suffered as a result. We will be making the reverse journey so will see if this was a one off with the food options.
Fingers crossed the next flight is the 5 star we had expected!",neutral

After calling them everyday for more than a week and being told they would get back to me still waiting . We have now lost the hotel money plus the test and Go . Thai visa and taxi fares not to mention the loss of work .,negative
2646,"Singapore Airlines - Simply Amazing! Booked an isle seat while my friend booked the window seat with the hope that no-one landed in between. Found on take-off that the seats in the middle row were totally unoccupied and the hostess encouraged me to move there so I put all the arms up and slept all the way to Singapore. That is all I can say about that flight. Then - from Singapore to London. I had 'made an offer' ($900.00) which was 'unsuccessful' so my friend paid over $1,000 for the next leg so she could upgrade to premium economy and I had paid about $30.00 for a specific seat (I really wanted an isle seat as being a bit (OK a lot) older I didn't want to have to climb over two people each time nature called Then...Waiting to board the plane,  for the second leg of our journey I said to my friend ""I am going to be the last person on so they have to page me and I will record it on my mobile, just for fun."" Then they paged me! After asking for my passport, they advised that they had a family travelling together who wanted my seat and was I prepared to give it up. Given that my girlfriend had abandoned me to go premium economy I now wasn't worried about keeping my seat so I agreed to give it up. THEN They put me in a 'premium row' with additional leg room!! The other two people advised that they were 'platinum flyers' but didn't upgrade because they wanted to use their points to fly their whole family on holidays. However, the hostess treated them like VIP's and it rubbed off on me. I got a complimentary goodie bag and lots of attention from the hostie. I may have drunk nearly a whole bottle of Baileys on the trip to London (OK I did) and stocked up on chocolate bars, chips and muesli bars for later consumption. It was an EXCELLENT experience.",positive

5496,"Comfortable and clean We first time long haul flyers chose Singapore airlines as our main carrier due to reputation. Our first leg from Akl to Singapore was with Airnz and have to say we were impressed with their service, food and drinks. Expecting even better from Singapore airlines we were a little disappointed. Staff were friendly, food when served was plentiful (cant please everyone's palate) and water was offered regularly. Our first leg was a 13 hour plus flight and after being served the first meal we were then left wondering after 6 to 8 hours when the  next meal was coming. When we finally asked when the next meal was to be served found out about 2 hours before landing. Was then told we could help ourselves to snacks ( sandwiches, muffins etc from galley). Have to say sandwiches very nice but if these snacks had been offered earlier or regularly would've given a higher rating. Seating in economy was what you would expect and the 3 of us being around 5 ft tall was ok. Blankets and pillows were on all seats when we boarded but felt compared to Airnz movie selection was a bit poor. The hot flannels handed out after takeoff and before landing was nice as was bag with socks and toothbrush and paste. A bit more information as to meal times and offering snacks ( without feeling a nuisance for asking), would be a positive move. Toilets were generally clean considering the usage and mouth wash, toothbrushes, sanitary products, hand lotion and cologne a nice touch. 8/10 for efficiency and timeliness.",positive
700,"***AVOID AT ALL COSTS*** ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS***

An absolute scam of an airline company, I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st of April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by LYING to me insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for SCREWING UP my booking and LYING to me, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London. Kudos to you idiots at Singapore Airlines for this.

My main issues are these:

1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st of April, which I did on 20th of April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer? The agent responsible for this is Shifana Khan, Customer Service Executive at Singapore Airlines.

2) When I called to enquire about the unconfirmed flight change, why did your agent lie to me and say that the original flight that I was supposed to change to was cancelled, and try to scam me for SGD 1700? IS IT ETHICAL TO LIE? Unfortunately I do not have the name of this agent as I was too shocked over the phone when I heard this.

In summary, if you want to get overcharged for non existent customer service and want your travel plans to go up into flames, use Singapore Airlines. 

And also do check out their Facebook page to see a log of unhappy customers who are facing/ faced similar issues as me, who had their travel experience spoilt because of their incompetency.",negative

I was looking forward to become a Gold Member (as my company only allows me to fly economy and premium economy) and it’s the highest I can get... I have to say that I’m VERY disappointed with the lounge you offer us. Crap layout, unattractive work space and confortable seatings..  I was a Gold and Platinum member (yes even on economy i could get to Platinum) on Cathay Pacific before moving here and the comparison of lounges aren’t even close by 10001 miles ! Even regular passenger have better seat option within the airport. Simply go check in front of Wolfgang Puck restaurant where I when after experiencing this cheap offer of a lounge.

9300,"Choose yr flight from Brisbane Carefully The problem with this flight was the equipment (an ""old"" Boeing 777) and the arrival time in Changi.

Even tho there are transit hotels - they are always booked out. So you have to try and find a comfortable chair to get some sleep.
With an arrival of 00:15 - I cannot understand why SQ wants to serve a ""full"" meal just before landing. The actual meals offered were not so so special. Why not just offer a sandwich or wrap??

7309,"Premium Economy is the New Economy I was excited about the non-stop flight from Singapore Airlines which we always have had incredible experience with. However, with the newly launched non-stop flight to Singapore, there are several misses which I felt degraded the overall experience I had come to expect from Singapore Airlines. 

While I have no complains with the seats on Premium Economy (""PE""), I am less than enthusiastic with the service on the flight compared to what I used to experience with the A380 on Singapore Airlines from JFK. SQ021 only has business and premium economy seats on the flight. This basically means PE is the new Economy, and it does feel a little that way for the flight as the basis for comparison is just between PE and Business. 

The plane is definitely smaller than the A380 and it feels that way despite the slightly higher ceiling. There really isn't much room to wander around since the PE class is all the way at the back of the plane, compared to the A380 where there is a galley area to hangout during the long flight, and a much larger economy class area to roam about. 

Amenities kit is limited to socks and eye mask, but on the bright side, they do serve decent champagne like Moet & Chandon. The Krisworld entertainment is amazing with the touchscreen and full of movie/tv/music options. Service wise, the crew was very attentive, though I feel that there seems to be less interaction with the passengers than the usual flights, perhaps due to the long journey. 

While the non-stop flight did shaved a couple hours off the journey, I think I would go back to the regular Frankfurt route with the stopover as it was nice break, and being to stretch and walk about for a bit was great.",positive

The seats on both are really big boxes and you have to lie and even sit at an angle to get your feet to squeeze into the wee box that is meant to accommodate them. It is almost impossible to get a reasonably comfortable seated recline. The pre-ordered food was good. Service was good. The choice of entertainment is extraordinary.

5588,"Expected More So disappointing!
However the good things with flying on this B777-200 flight was that 
1)it left right on time
2) the space between your knees and the seat in front was more than ample. 
It was a smooth flight and arrived on time.
Then the disappointing things mounted up :-
1) my seat had little stuffing in the seat
2) my monitor failed to work after 30 mins
3)the movies choice was old
4) the remote was not user friendly
.... disappointing
The meal of BBQ chicken was horrible.
1) green vegetables were grey, over cooked
2) rice was soggy
3)the sauce was highly composed of sweetness
The hostess didn’t give the elderly woman beside me a chance of a drink but gave her tea without offering a wine. Plus gave her pasta and not offering a BBQ chicken.
Poor service
..... disappointing
Flying from NZ I would have expected a reasonable good NZ wine but no it was a South American wine!!
....disappointing
Finally with 30 mins before landing I still had not been offered Customs Declaration to fill in.
I had to go and ask for one. First time in all my travel this has happened.

When I posted that earlier review I didn't mention that I was travelling business class on SQ361/2, and that I was unable to find a convenient business class lounge for the DME layover. Now that I have travelled this route again here's what I can share with you if you too are travelling business class on SQ361/362 via DME. There is a lounge that business class travellers can use. Its called бизнес зал аэропорта (Airport Business Lounge). Its location and directions to it are actually printed on the reverse of the transit boarding card that you receive at DME. (I only realised that the directions to the lounge were printed on the back of the transit boarding card after my trip was over - easy to miss, and nothing to indicate business class lounge availability  after passing through transit security)

As you exit from the Transit security area immediately turn left and ascend the escalator (instead of walking along the corridor straight ahead to gate at which you will re-board SQ361/2) to the level above and follow the signs to a corridor on your right that indicates the location of the Airport Business Lounge (there are a couple of other lounges along that corridor).

Check-in, after we had checked in on the web, took the best part of 20 minutes with staff telling us it was 'system trouble' when they were clearly nonplussed about the meaning of the term 'indefinite' against the column 'Expiry Date' of my Philippine visa. They were unable to see that I had entered the Philippines a dozen times in 2018 on the strength of my permanent retiree visa, nor did they ask to see my visa-linked identity card issued by the Philippine government. 
The seat surroundings were filthy - stains left behind by previous passengers had not been cleaned and there was grime everywhere. When we spoke to the Purser, she brought wet wipes to clean the filth herself but to little avail - the stains and grime had accumulated over time, and there was little that wet wipes could do.
The seats themselves were touted as angled lie-flat. The reality is that you keep sliding off the seat given the angle - it wasn't worth complaining since these seats have been around for at least 15 years and Singapore Airlines hasn't bothered to replace them despite their obvious shortcomings. Aircraft with these seats are typically used for routes to and from South Asia and, occasionally, Southeast Asia. They cannot be seen on routes to Europe and North America.
The business class section had two toilets, one of which was unserviceable for the duration of the flight. Shockingly, two of the economy class toilets were also unserviceable. And it was a full flight. Imagine the discomfort of the passengers lining up in the few serviceable toilets.

The beer they served was a mere 4 oz (much less than a regular 12 oz can) in a small plastic cup so I had to sipped it slowly like fine wine. When I asked for the whole can, the attendant was puzzled and brought me another 4 oz teeny weeny cup. I have flown on worst airlines like Indian airlines, etc and did not get any voucher compensation but Singapore Air is supposed to be No. 1.",neutral
7415,"Singapore Airlines the preferred airline, especially for long-haul flights. You may have to pay a premium for Singapore Airlines, but with that comes world-class airline services that sets a very high standard for inflight entertainment, choice of meals, and other ad-hoc requirements. 

As a PPS (SQ business class travel card) member, I still get preferred services, whilst traveling economy class. Although I'd recommend for longer flights to upgrade, even paying more for Premium Economy or Business Class, if you want the full SQ experience, Still ahead when compared many international world class airlines from Asia, Europe, or America.",positive

1936,"Sydney to Singapore with a stop in Canberra I have flown this route many times on various airlines but Singapore Airlines is my preferred due to my SQ FF status. I get to use the lounge and have better access to preferred seating. This was my first flight on SQ288 departing Sydney daily at 9:30pm with a brief stop in Canberra. The full flight routing is Singapore-Sydney-Canberra-Singapore. May travellers get off in Canberra after a stop in Sydney. The route is serviced by a B777-300ER with First Class if you want. Loads out of Canberra are generally lighter. On this over night flight arriving one hour early at 4:00am I had 3 seats to myself and was able sleep for a while. However, the woman in front of me kept reaching back and touching the touch screen which turned it on and woke me up! What reach back all the time?? I had to keep turning if off in the dark cabin. We are at a hight alert level with the Corona Virus and all fight crew wore masks. They did not have to smile I guess but they said it with their eyes.",positive

The only thing that was annoying was trying to book suitable seats. We were told different things and didn’t realise that when you book the flight you can also book the seats. However when we got on we had perfect seats. The seats don’t seem as squashed as some airlines, the staff were lovely and helpful.

1187,"Treated like a King/Queen A trusted source had always raved about Singapore Airlines to me. It remains my only flight with them, a return one in 2016, but I can say the customer service is second to none, and I have Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific top of my list. They make sure you are hydrated and well fed, constantly bringing around drinks and snacks and walking up and down the aisles to collect your rubbish. I had a special meal so I wasn't entitled to the ice-cream dessert for the standard meals, but the lovely air stewardess remembered and gave the spare one leftover to me. Not only do they have metal cutlery, but the air steward I asked many questions to answered them all. Changi Airport is familiar to me and rates highly on my list of best airports in the World and they did not disappoint. Instead of an hour until boarding for my connecting flight, I had twenty minutes due to the pilots arriving late at Heathrow: as soon as we set foot in Changi airport, there was one staff person waiting to tell us where to go and they gave me very clear instructions. I did not miss my flight.",positive

They were sent to the back to the amusement of other passengers. The flight was fantastic, the staff could do no more and every request was greeted with a smile and fantasic service. Nothing was to much trouble and the service is so subtle, it works amazinly well.

2351,"Disappointed We had high expectations, as I had heard good things about Singapore Airlines, but unfortunately we were left disappointed.  We would normally fly Jetstar business class and I wish we had of stayed with them, as Singapore airlines was more expensive. 

The set up of the plane was poor compared to business class on Jetstar, the toilet situation was undesirable because unlike on business class Jetstar you are only sharing the toilet with about 28 other passengers. On Singapore premium economy you are sharing it with the whole plain. The service was poor. We we not offered refreshments prior to take off and I imagine this was because of the layout of the plane. When we were offered refreshments and food it took forever for the flight attendants to come round and collect the rubbish and empty trays. 

Overall I would rate Singapore Airlines as poor and would not fly with them again, and I definitely would not recommend them.",negative

8987,"LS PHEE KIM MENG - SQ 805 22nd sept 855am I've flown with Singapore airlines numerous times. Yes there has been good service most trips however with this one... you will definitely have trouble finding someone to TOP the EXCELLENT SERVICE LEVELS of LS PHEE KIM MENG. 

1) As per usual SQ style, all guests were greeted with a smile. LS PHEE did not greet guests as if it were part of his job to greet us.. LS PHEE greeted us as if he was truly glad to have us on board. The smile and greeting was so sincere and genuine you could not help but feel that the flight was going to be an exceptional one. 

2) LS PHEE must have noticed my slight limp. Due to my medical situation, my feet swell up a lot and it makes it hard for me to walk so I hobble. They also hurt a lot. However due to the flight being booked at the last minute (change of flight due to typhoon heading to HK last week) I was stuck in economy. It would have been ideal to have gotten a seat where I could elevate my legs... and then I was greeted with LS PHEE's big friendly grin telling me that he will keep a lookout for me on a particular row which could possibly be empty. If it all goes well, he will let me know so I could move. With lady luck on my side and LS PHEE, it was available and I moved forward to the empty row. Like that wasn't enough, LS PHEE offered to take my carry on for me and asked if I needed reading material since my bag was stored on top.. and if there was anything I needed before take off. After the seat belt sign was switched off, he quickly came over to ask if I need help with my bags and proceeded to ensure i was good and comfy... and entertained (got my earphones reading material etc). 

3) during food service, LS PHEE ensured to look out for me as well making sure I got my meal as I liked and proceeded to check everyone else as well. This was so helpful as I was due for my next round of meds that I needed to take after meals as well. 

4) now this is all my own experience but being an editor of a senior management magazine who also does reviews, I was sure to look out for other observations too. LS PHEE was friendly and helpful to all passengers and as you know, that always makes for an extra special flight. 

5) last but not least, LS PHEE is equally polite, caring, and helpful to his fellow crew mates. Now dear Singaporeairlines, you have a gem of a staff here and I truly hope that you realise that:). 

I do sincerely hope that this email is shared with LS PHEE as well as put on his record. I'll be sure to share this on my platforms too. LS PHEE to me is the epitome of SQ serviceexcellence that I've felt has dipped over the past few years. LS PHEE has once again revived my love for the airline and faith that your service levels will keep going only one way.. UP Yours truly Sadie-Jane NUNIS Krisflyer 8230650646Seat 41H",positive

7759,"Singapore Airlines to the UK Flew from Canberra to Singapore then on to London. Night flight out which is excellent. I put in bid for an upgrade for a premium economy seat which I got for the first leg. Best move. I had the front row by the emergency exit so no-one in front. Had a meal and slept for most of that leg.

Economy for the long leg from Singapore to London. Couldn’t bid for an upgrade as that leg was full. While it was ok, it made me realise that premium economy is definitely the way to go. Sitting in economy for 13 hours was hard going.

I’ve flown Singapore Airlines a few times and the food has always been excellent. This time it was ok but not up to the usual high standard.

Two recommendations - if you can afford to fly premium economy do it. Especially if you can put in a bid for an upgrade.
 
Check the seating plan for the A380. I booked a seat that showed on the seating plan as three seats behind the bulk head seats with one seat not having a seat in front of it. I was very happy to think I was going to be able to stretch out.  Much to my dismay, I got to my seat only to find that the seating plan was wrong. The seat by the window had the legroom. Not mine. Check the seating plan and check with the airline. The passenger beside me also confirmed that she had seen the same seating plan that showed my seat with nothing in front of it.

I would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again - good time going into London, late in the afternoon. I would definitely try to fly premium economy and if I couldn’t I would recommend getting a seat with extra legroom but confirm that with the airline.",positive

The attendants missed us twice to provide a meal, I had to remind them on both occasrion.  The last meal Singapore-Sydney was disgraceful.

1094,"Singapore Air is Price Gouging for people who rebook due to Covid I am disappointed that Singapore Airlines is price gouging and taking advantage of people who need to rebook flight due to covid. I had an oringinal booking from Osaka to Singapore for Dec 23, 2021. I could not travel due to covid and I wanted to push my flight back one year. Singapore Air would not let me do this so I pushed it back to April of 2022 with the intention of pushing that one back to Dec 23, 2022 when I intend to fly. I am now trying to  rebook from April to December 2022 and my travel agency (Expedia) told me it will cost over $2000 per ticket to rebook!!! This is outrageous!!! The fares online for that date are $679 USD per person. I paid $569 USD for my original ticket and $130 USD to rebook to April the first time for a total of $699 per ticket. So although the website says its $679 to purchase a ticket in December of 2022, I am being told its the amount I have already paid plus over $2000! This is taking advantage of your customers. I have never flown with Singapore Air and I was excited to experience and see what was behind all the good reviews online.

Well, this is the first time I didn’t be able to use lounge while travelling business class worldwide with all other airlines. Weird policy and there is no lounge at all for this route.

Having said that, both were extremely comfortable to sit in. If you have the time, to try make use of the Book the Cook facility where until 24 hours before departure you can make your choice of your main course on the flight.

8383,"Great Flight from Singapore to London The Singapore Airlines A380 flight from Singapore to London, UK offers excellent service and value for your money in Premium Economy Class.

The flight staff were attentive, professional and friendly and the long direct flight of 13 hours and 35 minutes seemed to go by quickly. I highly recommend Premium Economy Class for this flight with wide and comfortable seats in a 2-4-2 configuration especially in the window and isle combination (2). You do not have to share an armrest, you have extra legroom and an additional recline angle for your seat that allows for sleeping on this overnight flight to London.

The food was well above average and there is a wide range of entertainment options for movies, TV shows, news and music for those who do not want to sleep. For those who do choose to sleep after the main meal and before breakfast, Singapore Airlines offers large blankets and reasonably comfortable pillows.

This A380 flight is great for those that have business or tourism in London. Compared with many long haul flights, Singapore Airlines flight SQ306 is one of the better options available and it lives up to the Singapore Airlines ranking as one of the best airlines in the world. It certainly met with my needs and expectations and I would book this flight again.

Put it on your list of options as it offers competitive cost, good service and the quality of a first class airline from Singapore to London. While you can ask for a sleep mask and earplugs, Singapore Airlines, should include these for everyone who chooses to fly in premium economy class on a flight of this duration.",positive
3288,"First trip On my first trip to Asia I chose to go Singapore Airlines.  It was recommended by the travel agency I used to book the trip. It was first class (no pun intended) all the way except for the food.   Plenty of it but lacking in taste.  Hence only 4 out of 5.   Great service and accommodations, though.",positive
8168,"Bag drop at Heathrow took far too long A disappointing start when finding the queue for bag drop was shared with other airlines, so after tagging our own bags - queued through a well-snaked line for 25 minutes to drop our bags at the counter. not good enough for an airline of SQ reputation. 
Rest of the flight pretty standard - but disappointing start. In other trips Emirates and Qantas have had better check in experiences at Heathrow.",positive
4833,"Great flight I flew a late afternoon flight to Singapore and it was good.  I was lucky enough to have an aisle seat and it had a decent amount of leg room.  The seats were comfortable and certainly wide enough.

The inflight entertainment had a very wide range of viewing options, ranging from the latest movies to BBC comedies and documentaries.  A lot of Asian and Indian content too, so more than enough to keep you entertained on the flight.

The cabin crew were superb (As always with Singapore Airline).  They could not be more helpful, cheerful and efficient.  A big thumbs up to them.  

The food was certainly a highlight of the flight for me.  I was lucky enough to have, I think it was called Bombo chicken with rice.  It was an Indonesian meal and was superb.  I mean really tasty and well cooked.  For desert was Mrs Beer vanilla ice cream which was certainly a high grade ice cream.

The flight was smooth and certainly could not be criticised in any way or form.  I will definitely be flying with Singapore Airlines again.",positive
1379,"Unfair Charges Due to Government border shutdowns, I decided to bring my flights home forward by 2 days.

This was far more than double what the original flights cost.",negative
5057,"Downward Spiral Actually there were four flights including returns with Singapore Airlines on a recent trip to Japan. Over the last few years I have noticed the decline in standards of what was once my preferred airline. The one constant was the staff were always polite and friendly, but beyond that even the service was noticeably less efficient. Of the four flights at least once on each flight I was given either the wrong meal or staff didn't follow up a service request. On at least two of the flights I know alcohol is normally given, none was offered, and on inquiring was told non was available. Cost cutting? less effective training? The worst observation was the standard of food was really poor other than one evening meal of Nasi Goreng which was fantastic. I think they have forgotten what reasonably fresh bread rolls are? I would MUCH prefer cold hand towels and warmed bread rolls instead of the 3 day old hard fare being served. Will seriously think about whether i will fly with them in future.",neutral

3070,"Disappointing Disappointed with the service.
Was a late evening flight so they wanted everyone to go to sleep. Even though some were watching videos or reading there was little/No cabin service.
Breakfast service started a couple of hours out. Breakfast menu limited to one Asian and one European selection. Omelette was dry, chicken sausage tasteless. Pastry selection limited to a  selection of rolls only. Apart from the extra legroom business class was not worth the extra money on this flight..",neutral
8248,"Very good service, seat/bed uncomfortable for tall people I know that Singapore Airlines is regularly rated one of the best airlines and was anticipating this flight a lot. Service on board was friendly, quick and efficient. Their „book the cook“ option is good way to chose your dish in advance from a really comprehensive menu. Unfortunately, my steak was extremely chewy. But this can happen.
The reason for my poor rating is that although their seat is one of the widest, for tall people it’s just too small. When turning the seat into a bed, feet have to fit into a small cube. I‘m 6.1 tall, and is was kind of hard to put my feet in there. Best way was sleeping on the side with bend legs. 
IMO other airlines have a way better seat/bed, like Air Canada or Oman Air. So from a service point of view SQ is definitely doing it right. But their seat just isn’t made for tall people to sleep relaxed. And on long-haul flights to me it’s more important to get a good sleep than to have decent meals. Bottom line is: I wouldn’t fly SQ again.",negative

20,Don’t travel Singapore Airlines or you have sick parents Flight SQ 241 - I was treated so rudely by the flight staff when we landed in Singapore. I had booked wheelchair assistance for my 76 year old dad has acute asthma and hip problems and my 73 year old mum with both knee replacements. I was told I need to walk to the buggy area as there didn’t have the staff to assist with the wheelchair. My dad ended up having an asthma attack and my both my parents were distress with high blood pressure. After such a long day for Dehli to Singapore we had to catch a flight to Sydney with two unwell highly distressed parent where no one cared to give them wheelchairs or any empathy.

3541,"Extremely disappointed I was told by many people how reliable and fabulous this airline was, so I booked my flights through them.

I travelled from Melbourne to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne aboard Singapore Airlines.  I was bitterly disappointed on my journey home as, despite travelling with my partner, they decided to separate us.  Not just a row or two but, 10 rows and a wall separated us.  When we mentioned it to the crew in India, the male staff member basically told us it was too bad and we would have to arrange something ourselves once we arrived in Singapore (the 2nd leg of our flight home).  

Upon arrival in Singapore we were shocked and horrified to find that we would have to speak with the passenger ourselves to sort something out.  The airline made an  error and we have to sort it out!!!  Long story short, we managed to sort it with the fellow traveller but it should never have been left to us to sort.  

Staff are friendly, food is reasonable and seats are uncomfortable for long haul flights.  

I would fly Singapore Airlines again but, only if they could ensure me from the get go that when two people are booked together, that they are actually seated together.",neutral

I’d rate them at 7.5 - this was short haul though while all others were over 11 hour flights. In future we’ll pay a bit more and fly Singapore the whole way.

We paid to go business class but other than the leg room we may as well saved the extra $10,000 it cost. On two legs especially the London to Singapore when we were on an A380, it was shabby with torn and worn armrest and seat but worse it had not been cleaned even though it left over an hour late, there was rubbish and even an old banana down the gap between the window and seat, the choice of food for the most part was not up to standard, not everyone wants a rice dish or an over elaborate omelet which was under cooked..We contacted the airline prior to departure to see if we were allowed a guest in the business lounge, we were informed by email that And I quote, Kris club and kris flyer gold flyers were allowed to bring a guest, our daughter was going to be on the same flight on our return journey and we wished to take advantage of the business lounge. We duly arrived at the Business lounge to be told a guest was not allowed as we were Kris flyers, we showed the lady the email from their customer service dept, she explained that it should have read Kris flyer gold and Kris cub gold members only. As you can imagine we were deeply embarrassed. We will never fly them ever again. I must say the cabin crew were very good but on our next trip we will definitely be flying Emirates",negative

9483,"Good but not the best A very short review. The standard expectations from a known club like Singapore airlines were well met. The service and food were quite good. The toilets were clean and the flights were more or less on time. 

My flight was in two parts, from mumbai to Singapore on Airbus and from Singapore to Auckland in a Boeing. While the Airbus journey was superbly comforting even in seating, i faced some seating issues in their Boeing aircraft. Although i had opted for an extra legroom seat, the seat itself was quite cramped for a long 8-9 hour flight as compared to their Airbus. Plus, i had to push my luggage into the overhead cabin quite down the aisle from the place of my seat as there wasn’t room left on top. This made it hard for me to go and get my things especially at night when others are sleeping and you might not want to disturb them.

Apart from that, nothing stood out to be exceptional. It was a decent flying experience.",neutral
364,"Worst Airline Ever with customer service at the airport in Singapore I recently traveled with Singapore Airlines on a trip from JFK to Bali, Indonesia in March 2023, reservation number 4DRFLW. As an avid traveler, I feel compelled to share my experience in order to provide an accurate account of my time with the airline.

To begin with, I opted for a coach class ticket, which turned out to be a regrettable decision. The seating arrangement in coach was extremely cramped, leaving very little legroom. The close proximity of the seats made it challenging to read or move comfortably, especially when the person in front reclined their seat. This often resulted in an uncomfortable experience, with their seatback practically on top of my knees, and I am only 5' in height. Even a simple trip to the bathroom became a cumbersome task, as I had to rely on holding onto the seats in front of me for support.

During our layover in Germany, my travel companion and I decided to upgrade to business class, which offered a considerable improvement in comfort and space. However, upon our return journey, we requested an upgrade to business class for the Singapore to Germany leg, but we were informed that we could only upgrade for the entire itinerary. This policy seemed inconsistent, as we were allowed to upgrade on our way to Bali. The lack of flexibility in this matter left us puzzled and dissatisfied.

Furthermore, I must express my disappointment with the attitude and behavior of the staff at Singapore Airlines. Throughout my interactions with them, I found them to be rude and unhelpful, which was surprising considering the airline's reputation. Curiosity led me to inquire about the experiences of my Asian friends who had traveled with Singapore Airlines in the past, and to my surprise, they echoed similar sentiments, sharing that they preferred non-Asian airlines due to concerns about service quality and aircraft standards. This realization only deepened my disappointment.

In addition, I found the process of dealing with Singapore Airlines' customer service to be daunting. Their staff appeared unable to think creatively or go beyond established protocols, which left me questioning their effectiveness and ability to address customer concerns.

It is important to note that my experience with Singapore Airlines encompasses merely the tip of the iceberg. While I understand that every airline can have its flaws, it is disheartening to encounter such issues with an airline of Singapore Airlines' reputation.

Based on my experience, I would advise fellow travelers to consider investing a bit more to ensure a better flying experience. While Singapore Airlines may have its merits, my encounter leaves me hesitant to recommend them wholeheartedly.",negative
5158,"Despicable behaviour to loyal customers Are you considering Krisflyer as a Star Alliance loyalty programme? Forget it!

As a Krisflyer gold member for the past few years I haven't redeemed many flights through Singapore Airlines because they make the process so complicated and tedious. Since they are gradually introducing other Star Alliance airlines to their online redemption searches - about 10 years behind other leading airlines - I decided to book a reward flight on SAS from Copenhagen to Oslo. 

The flight cost 12,000 miles plus US$25. But, since I can no longer travel during this period, I gave advanced notice and attempted to cancel the booking online. Over one week later I get an SMS saying that I need to call them, only to discover that I must pay a US$75 fee to cancel the flight. The only explanation is that it was in the terms and conditions. 

I have a Oneworld Emerald and Skyteam account with other airlines, and neither of the airlines through which I have redeemed flights in the past charge such ridiculous and unexplained fees. In fact, the entire process is automated and refunds are processed promptly, sometimes immediately.

How Singapore Airlines seeks to penalise loyal members for its own outdated practices and systems is unreal. It's a complete disgrace. A single attempt to cancel a reward flight that ends up costing you 30 minutes on the phone to Singapore and US$75. That's loyalty punished right there!

I plan to draw down my Krisflyer account and cease flying them altogether. I'll look into a better Star Alliance airline programme and suggest you do the same.

Nothing was mentioned that when we get to our 1st stop off we were going to have to wait nearly 24 hours in Singapore airport, then after that we were going to have to wait another 18 hours in Frankfurt for our final flight. None of this was on our original itinerary & we weren’t informed until we got to our 1st stop off, this change of flights was all done by Singapore airlines & no one informed us on check in.

I have flown business and economy on Singapore Airlines A350 and they are both good products and clean, comfortable and this is a good airline to fly with.",positive
4281,"Still very disappointing.... Unfortunately, still an unpleasant experience on a first class flight with Singapore Airlines...in view of the price paid of course. 

As usual with Singapore Airlines, as a first-class passenger you are only granted access to the business class lounges both in Geneva and in Frankfurt...very disappointing. No way you can get the highest rating with such a policy. There was also no pre-boarding for first-class passengers in Frankfurt.

Also hurting my rating is the cabin, which was quite old on this flight in an Airbus 380. It is actually not much better than a new business class cabin on a A350 of Singapore Airlines. Service was ok but very ""stereotyped"". The menu looked appealing but was not that great in reality. They have a ""Georges Blanc "" tasting-menu but apparently they are struggling to make it ready in the plane. The meat was totally overcooked and could not be eaten. 

Champagne (Dom Perignon) and wines are quite good. The movie selection is really not great. This is unfortunate, as the headsets and the screens are great.

4836,"SQ Ultra-long flights SQ38/37 I was a bit apprehensive about taking these flights due to the length (15 hours outgoing & 17 hours return) as I have major difficulty sleeping on planes (even on flat beds), but the promotional offer that they had beat the next best fares by US$700 which made this a no brainer. I made some adjustments for this trip and bought a neck pillow (firm as opposed to soft) and took a sleeping medication which I usually avoid.

Check-in and boarding was quick and easy as there were only 160+ passengers due to the configuration of the A350-900ULR aircraft. Bio-metric boarding was used in both Singapore and Los Angeles. Once settled in after take-off, drinks and dinner were served. Those who reserved their meals using the ""Book The Chef"" were served first, and I finished omg meal before the rest of the other passengers were served their meal.

On the outgoing, I ordered the roast chicken rice and considering that Singapore is their home base, I was disappointed with both the quality and the portion. I was left feeling hungry. There were mid-flight snacks available later but it was western biased. I brought my own instant noodles (comfort food for many Asians, and SQ should seriously consider making it available on the flight - and I was not the only one on board who brought my own instant noodles). The 2nd main meal which was first served about 7 hours into the flight has now changed to 2 hours before landing based on passenger feedback. I agree with this change) and I ordered a nasi lemak this time. Again the quality and portion were disappointing. On the return flight out of Los Angeles, I ordered the prawn sambal rice and dim sim, and they were much better and portions were slightly bigger. 

The crew were excellent and were proactively going round to ensure we were well hydrated, and happily prepared the cup instant noodles when asked.

The seat was comfortable. I was able to select the individual seat at the back which had its own hand luggage compartment. I was not disturbed by anyone else. Even the single seat in the last row was able to recline to its max and was not hindered by the wall behind.

I was able to get about 3-4 hours sleep on the outgoing and about 6 hours on the return, which was a first for me. This was definitely helped by the A350 carbon fuselage technology which allowed a higher cabin pressure and more humidity compared to the traditional aluminium fuselage. I felt more refreshed and less tired compared to 8-hour flights in conventional planes.

Flight was on-time on the outgoing but was delayed on the return due to a passenger fainting in the cabin during boarding. This delayed the flight by an hour but it was not the airline's fault. The captain kept the passengers informed on the progress during the delay, which was good. The only negative was that a number of fellow passengers were more keen to take photos/videos of the incident and blocking the passageway of those who were trying to help (cabin crew and other passengers).

I would definitely consider SQ's ultra long flights as a serious option if I were to travel to the USA.",positive

Pro's: 
1. Service on board: very attentive friendly attendants and very clean toilets. 
2. Food on board: generous amount and delicious. Varieties are also very good. 
3. Ground service: very well prepared to handle flight transfers at delays. Their ground staff were already waiting for us to whisk us through the airport to catch our connecting flight when our previous flight was delayed. 
4. Baggage allowance of 30 kg per person which is a lot more than (most of) Western airlines.

Contra's: 
1. The site for Online check-in did not work properly. It hung lots of time and didn't give clear messages when there was any issue (for example when the online check in of the connecting flight was not yet available or had to be done on their partner website).

6738,"A reliable airline to fly with I travelled to Mumbai from Sydney on 25th December 2018 (on Christmas day). The seating was comfortable, and so the other facilities. The crew were friendly and helpful. The food and the beverages served were quite nice. All in all, I was quite happy with my flight. I returned to Sydney from Bangalore via the same airline on 1st February 2019. The important thing I want to mention about the Singapore Airline is their punctuality.",positive

4872,"Not worth the money Having booked with Air New Zealand for a round trip to the UK we enjoyed our flight over with Air NZ and Virgin Atlantic and looking forward to our first trip all the way back with Singapore Airlines.  Oh what a disappointment, paying the extra for premium economy was just not worth it.  The only advantage was a bigger seat and priority baggage collection, no welcome drink, same food as served in economy, no nice glasses just the usual plastic, the white wine served was warm and the comfort pouch for overnight did not even include an eye mask.  Sorry Singapore Airlines you have a lot to learn from Air NZ and Virgin on how to treat your premium economy customers who have paid a lot extra for their travel.  We will not travel with you again.",negative
7174,"THE MOST DREADFUL AIRLINE BREAKFAST EVER While not expecting haute cuisine, the breakfast aboard SQ295 was just inedible. It consisted of a very highly spiced chicken sausage, greasy roast potatoes and a dish called bread and egg pudding with Swis cheese that had the consistency of rubber. There is no excuse to serve such poor quality food. To their credit the airline staff were charming and attentive and gave me a ham salad bun which was tasty and fresh.
We booked early and were able to secure seats of just two but this was an older plane and the seats weren’t particularly comfortable.
Sadly I don’t think Singapore Airlines is the airline it once was.",negative

6903,"#1 for a reason Singapore airline is rated the number 1 airline in the world and it shows. The staff on board are the most accommodating and professional I have ever saw. The airport is immaculate and the plane is just the same. Everyone gets a pillow and blanket. There are TVs located behind every seat with enough movies and shows to keep you busy during such a long flight. The in flight food is pretty good also. They feed you what seems like every 4 hours lol you also get free alcohol and snacks whenever you want. The flight was smooth to Germany then to Singapore everything went well no hold
ups or delays. The flight staff were well dressed and polite to everyone on board. I can’t recommend this airline enough when traveling abroad. Like I said they are #1 for a reason and it really shows. I’d pick Singapore airline everywhere I go and I wish airlines in the United States would model themselves after them as they are the pinnacle of flying right now.",positive

3876,"A good airline - Let down by inability to manage bookings thoughtfully We flew in April this year and again in August.

Both times managing the booking at ION has been less than satisfactory.

The issue is the staff are unable to provide seats to accommodate toddlers.

My wife wanted us to purchase a seat for our 1year old.  They fly free in the basinet/your lap but my wife wanted to bring the baby seat on board.

After the April trip, we discovered that if we use this the seat in front cannot recline.  

So i went in with plenty notice to get the front seat, i was told that there were no seats available?  Although booking online i could get a front seat with a bassinet.

But when i tried to book with a child under 2 the system has a hissie fit and cannot submit the ticket online.

So anyway the consultant said no seats available in the front row.

When we boarded the plane to Perth we were 2 rows back in the centre, the guy in front was not able to recline his seat.  he was annoyed but what could we do sadly...

The thing that bothered us was that ABC row 41 was occupied by 2 single folk, with a bassinet in front.... Seat b was empty...

I cannot understand how they were given this seat when we had a child, paid for an extra fair and doing our best not to inconvenience anyone...

Singapore airlines you really need to sort this out..

The second debacle was when we checked in on our flight home.  By this time we had flown 3 flights with the same car seat, it says flight approved.. that was good enough for everyone before.... This time the guy wanted to see approved by who??

It's not stated on the seat however he could see the brand and make and google if he wished.",positive
5204,"Mishandled baggage, poor food, poor inflight experience Our stroller wheel was broken and the cupholder tray was scratched. Food was very sub starndard.

4,"Premium Economy Seating on Singapore Airlines not worth the money! Premium Economy Seating on Singapore Airlines has narrow seats and poor leg room compared to Air NZ or Virgin.  Drinks served in plastic beakers, roast chicken tough as was the meat in the noodle dinner.  Orange juice concoction was not a premium offering.  Toilets - we had to walk half way back down the Economy cabin to queue for the toilet.  One toilet on the plane was not working. Having flown with Air NZ the day before the difference in amenities and poor value for money was apparent with Singapore Airlines.  Poor Kris Flyer website if you wish to upgrade it doesn't work!",negative
1849,"Great service We had multiple flights booked with Singapore Airlines. I had never flown with Singapore Airlines before, I was told by so many people how fantastic the airline and it is advertised as the best airline in the world! So maybe I already had too high expectations of the airline and I found them no better than other airlines I have been with in the past. 

Flights were a reasonable price and the service of the staff was second to none, nothing was too much trouble, the food was very average and on the plane you actually seemed very squashed in your seat more so than other airlines.

It is very expensive to upgrade your seats too in comparison to other airlines. We tried to upgrade in the bid and told unsuccessful but yet half the premium economy seats were left empty.

I would fly with Singapore again it was not a bad experience at all but not the excellence I was expecting over and above other airlines. I found it just the same as Quantas, Virgin, British Airways, Thomson flights I have been on and not as good as Emirates.",positive

5757,"Worst possible customer service after canceling the flight  Tonight, the flight SQ 325 from Frankfurt to Singapore was canceled. We also had a connection to Denpasar, flight SQ 948, so one day of vacation less! 

When the flight was canceled, nobody from Singapore Airlines took any care about the passengers. 

First of all, we were handed over to security staff from the airport at 11:30 PM. They kept us waiting for 15 minutes in a hallway, without anyone knowing why. Then, all the Singapore Airlines staff just DISAPPEARED, like magic. Nobody told us anything about when the flight will be rescheduled, or at least when they will let us know about the new flight. I literally had to carry our asleep son throughout the airport in my arms (and Frankfurt is a big airport) together with the carry on luggage, because nobody even asked if we need a trolley. After about one hour after deplaning us, we also had to wait (at midnight) with our son asleep in my arms for half an hour in the cold, outside of the airport, for the bus to the hotel.

Until now, it's the worst experience of my life flying business class, the level of customer care was even lower than low cost airlines.",negative

3685,An efficient well run airline A comfortable flight run with precision. The staff are almost robotic not getting too personal which is not that appealing.

474,"An unexpectedly comfortable red-eye flight This flight was the first of a two-legged itinenary from Singapore to Brussels (via Milan Malpensa), and left Changi Aiport close to midnight.  Concerned with a slightly tight connection (time-wise) in Milan, I had opted to pay a little extra for a seat in the forward zone of the economy section.  And I lucked out as no one occupyied the seat next to me in the final row of the section.  With that extra space to stretch out during the flight, I managed to get a better-than-expected stretch of rest as the flight travelled through the night.  The service of the staff was very good - engaging without being unncessarily obstrusive when passengers preferred to sleep.  Supper and breakfast were fine, although I have to admit that portions seem to have become smaller recently with the disappearance of an appetiser and fruits, respectively.  And the loss of hot towels being handed out before meals is also rather disappointing (perhaps COVID has something to do with it).  Overall, a rather comfortable flight.",positive

We did this in good faith only to be charged both bids then receive an email telling us our bid was unsuccessful. The charges are still on our credit card. I am currently trying to get these charges removed. As usual you can’t talk to anyone about it. All communication is via email and you will have to do all the leg work to get these charges removed. Not a good start to a holiday. I have since canceled all further offers as it’s not worth the hassle. We went with Singapore Airlines because we thought they were the best. 🤔,negative
3237,"First flight on a SQ Dreamliner I recently had a short flight on Singapore Airlines to Bangkok, a flight that utilised a B787 Dreamliner.  The check-in process was easy and straightforward, with the automated luggage belts working much more efficiently than when I last used them.  Boarding was smooth even though the flight was at least 80% full.  I was actually most eager on this flight to check out the plane's windows.  Designed to dim or lighten at the press of a button, the windows have not attached sliding shades.  Furthermore, the Dreamliner's windows are some of the largest, if not the largest, in the business, allowing for an improved view outside the plane. Unfortunately, as the flight was in the early evening, testing of the automatic dimmers had to be shelved.  The airline's Krisworld IFE was excellent with a super-extensive range of movies, shows, music and games as usual.  If anything, perhaps the only thing missing is a camera mounted outside the plane to allow for a different view during take-off, landing and in flight.  Food options were decent although I tend to find that the mains offered in economy somewhat dull, which turned out to be the case again although I was plesantly surprised that the meal came with brown rice, a healthier option compared to white rice.  Service standards were also definitely very good.  Overall, a good flight where everything worked although it will need another, preferably longer flight, to decide if the Dreamliner's my kind of aircraft.",positive
9917,"Great flight with SQ to Manila From Singapore to Manila on the new Boeing 787-10, I already flew in this plane before with SQ so I knew it was going to be a good flight. I managed to get the nice private seats (2 seats instead of 3 in the row) at the back of the plane for me and my girlfriend which was great. Legroom is excellent. FA's are friendly as always. The whole 3 hr flight was very comfy, I wish it was even longer so I could sleep a bit. 

The food was good, but we asked for fish and got chicken instead, I think the same happened to the person in the seat in front so there was a mix up with the meals. I had white wine with the meal, I don't drink wine often but that was nice. Even though there was some sort of desert in the meal, they did give ice cream also afterwards. I had Heineken beer for the rest of the flight, I totally forgot to ask for the Singapore Sling!

The short flight was great and I really want to try their long haul flights in the future.",positive
7176,"Will never fly again ! Don't recommend to anybody! 1) Our ticket had for just 1 hour transit at Hong Kong airport before going to Singapore. Singapore airlines sold the tickets without mentioning that we will need transit visa at Hong Kong airport. 
2) Singapore airlines called us just a day before the flight and changed the flight to a direct flight and assigned seats as we had paid $40 for seat selection earlier. When we went online for check in, the seats were actually not assigned. 
3) Singapore Airlines says seat selection will open within 48 hours from departure. The online never allowed that. We had to go through multiple calls and wait times just select a seat. Very INCONVENIENT and TIME CONSUMING process.
4) The customer representatives are very rude and not willing to help.",negative

4485,"Nothing special  When checking in for our flight the agent wanted us to check our hang-up bag.  After some pleading they let us take it to the gate and said it might have to be gate checked.  Never had this issue with United Airlines.   There was no pre-ck line at the airport even though it’s marked on the boarding pass.  The airline makes no effort to work with airport authorities on providing special handling of business class passengers. 
For the flight itself we were not impressed.  Asked for 2 different wines that were on the menu and they said they did not have them.   When we travel business class on other airlines I’ve never arrived hungry.   We did with Singapore Airlines.   You have to ask for any food or drinks on the second half of the 16 hr. flight.    When we host a party our guess don’t have to ask for there needs.  Didn’t feel like Singapore Airlines are good hosts.     When using lavatories we had to wait.   When we arrived in Singapore our bags were the last to come out even though our bags had priority tags.  When we left the airport we looked at each other and both thought how could Singapore Airlines be voted the world’s best airline.  🤷‍♂️",negative
5030,Excellent Crew and Service making a 13-hour flight a nice and comfortable experience is saying it all. The service and the attention of the crew are excellent. The premium economy is worth the extra money. the only minor point is the quality of the food and the frequency of meals and snacks offered. It is still good but I have the impression that SGP Airlines is on some cost saving here. Please keep your high standards and do not lower them following the competition's trend as this is for us the reason why we always will choose Singapore Airlines above the others.,positive

Just about everybody who travels a lot knows that Changi Airport in Singapore is in a class of its own - the new Jewel mallvaganza its crowning achievement, for now -  but Singapore Airlines is a befitting counterpiece.

1808,"Shoddy service and poor quality of aircraft My wife and I have been extremely disappointed at the deplorable quality of service of the airline in general as encountered throughout the REP-CCU route in Jan 2020. We chose Singapore as we had heard lots of wonderful things about the airline.  Our experience was worse than any cheap quality bucket-shop airlines and we thought Singapore was a world standard airline.

On the REP-SIN Route my seat had a broken table which I was informed only on the way to the boarding the flight when I was suddenly being pressurised by their ground staff. Although I was waiting at the airport near the gate for over an hour none of their ground staff bothered to discuss this matter with me. It was as if I was being pressured and coerced into accepting their deplorable service. Furthermore the table was only secured with sticky tape which kept falling on my lap and on a couple of occasions fell on my watch!

To cap it all having a disgusting experience from REP to SIN we then received further shoddy service from ground staff at Singapore on the Kolkata flight. Ground staff in SIN are rude and egoistic and do not treat customers with respect. We observed this behaviour of their ground staff with other passengers on the same flight. I made the mistake on relying on the name of this airline without realising how miserable their service has become from 10 years ago when we did fly with them to Singapore for the first time and were very happy with the service. Having paid USD 700 for our one-way ticket from REP to CCU I was shocked to be downgraded to an airline with filthy seats, filthy cabin no TV no leg space and in general badly in need of an uplift. You can see in the photo the filthy water trickling out of the toilets into the kitchen area behind the aircraft! To cap it all the cabin staff offered me gifts worth SGD 75 on the plane.  This offer got progressively downgraded by their head office to a few miles on their shoddy airline.  I refused the offer.",negative

It was last minute check in by us and I think they delayed few minutes till we checked in. If they did not do our entire trip have been a mess. Food was good. And it was a smooth take off and landing.",positive
4440,"wonderful inflight experience! Half way into the evening flight to Haneda, casually chatted with one of the Japanese crew about sake recommendations in Tokyo. She returned shortly later with a hand written list of premium sake brands, where to get them as well as Tokyo restaurant recommendations! What a delightful service experience, thank you Masako-san!",positive
1198,Terrible customer service Horrible customer service. Suddenly they announced that transit is not allowed for Indians. No one responds. Beware booking with them as they may hold your money and not give any information and ask you wait until ur travel date to finally say your booking is cancelled. I had good experience with other airlines like Lufthansa even during pandemic.I will never take this airline.,negative
3973,"The greatest company I have ever flown!!! Fantastic flight, great service, nothing can beat this company. I strongly recommend to book directly through their home page. You can choose your seat, your meal, and do the check in online before departure. The staff are always smiling despite the long hours and always ready to answer any question you might have. A great company indeed. Thank you",positive
6968,Seats uncomfortable Try to travel business class on long haul for flat beds. These seats were wide but quite firm and after a long time sitting got very uncomfortable. Also to get the flat bed you can’t just recline but need to flip seat so you either have flat bed or chair. It’s not easy to flip between the two so not ideal. Much prefer the reclining type like Emirates or BA. food was excellent and service ok.,neutral
3001,"A joy to travel with My third holiday this year to Asia and again I only want to fly with Singapore airlines. 
I always like to pay a little bit extra to get the baggage, entertainment and food included. The staff are always smiling and helpful, a credit to Singapore airlines. 
I'm a nervous flyer who suffers from anxiety in general so I need to feel comfortable in my surroundings. I never feel anything but comfortable flying with Singapore.
Food was delicious as usual and plenty to fill the space in my belly. The only downside which I always find is the tea is not as hot as I'd like. By the time you add the milk it's lukewarm but apart from that small thing everytime I fly with Singapore airlines it's perfect. 
I've booked for Phuket next August 2020 with Singapore but my trip back to Glasgow in Mar/April 2020 is with emirates as they fly direct to Glasgow and the cost was much better.",positive

429,"Harrased by the the ground staff at Changi Airport A ground staff member was extremely rude and misbehaved with us yesterday at Changi Airport around 7:30 pm at T3 gate A19. His name was Shiva or Shivam, and he was most likely of South Asian descent. He kept making rude gestures to my parents and me, both senior citizens, and after confronting him, he said he had every right to do so. He kept on changing the queue and continuously harrased us. We were tired and exhausted after 10 hour flight from Christchurch which was delayed. As a passenger I have paid the full price of my economy class ticket. We deserve the same amount of respect and courtesy to be extended to us as given to those in first and business class passengers. This discriminatory classist and racist behaviour has left a bitter taste in my mouth. We deserve an apology. I am very upset and disappointed with the world's leading airline.",negative
834,"Poor customer service We received an email from Singapore airlines notifying us of a slight change of time for our flight. After trying to log in to manage the booking, we were unable to do so. We contacted Singapore airlines to be told that our domestic flight had diverted to a different city meaning that there was a chance we could miss our international flight back to the Uk. After asking Singapore airlines to change our domestic flight to an earlier flight or to a flight the day before to give us more chance of catching our international flight, we were told they couldn’t change our flight to any of the ones we suggested. Extremely poor customer service, especially as their flight prices are extortionate now. If this journey doesn’t run smoothly we won’t be using them again.",negative

9186,"Sweetest, most attentive service  Haven’t flown SQ for about 20 years, as it’s typically one of the more expensive airlines, and it still remains as one of the best experiences to date.  The food was good but not great (a little too salty) but the service from the flight attendants was truly warm and sincere.  I prefer the 777-300 over the A380 as I feel the A380 upper deck is a bit low.   Really a great product!!!",positive
5205,"my comments were heard? This is the return leg of my trip to bangkok. The first leg, there was a feedback request via email sent to me by SQ. I mentioned about the bread rolls to be warmed up instead on wrapping them in cold plastic bags that bloated up once we are up there in the sky. And also commented that the air stewardess asked me, ""what would you like?"" when i saw no menu in the poach in front of me and there was no form of any communication as to what food were available.

Immediately on my return flight, i was served warm bread from the basket instead of the plastic bags. And of course, was handed a menu before i was served lunch. If these two matters were not coincidental, i would say that i am truly impressed with how serious SQ took their customers' feedbacks.

As for the rest of the items on offer like in-flight entertainment and leg room, still the best that i had. Always if possible, booked my flights with SQ if the options were available.

Thanks for the great flight!",positive

5821,"Whenever you get the chance, fly Singapore Airlines! A long flight made shorter by very comfortable seats, excellent food, outstanding service and very good entertainment options. We have flown on all of the Middle-East airlines and most of the Asian ones and nothing can match Singapore. The European and American airlines aren't even comparable. The planes are modern, the Business Class seat arrangement is 1-2-1 and compare that to an Emirates or Turkish 777 (both of which we have flown recently) which use a 2-3-2 configuration. The extra room makes for a much more comfortable 17 hour flight. This is how to run an airline!",positive
195,"There are better airlines!  Poor food, with snacks served instead of meals.

The only thing I don’t like is not having toilets in the premium economy section.",positive
7992,Highly recommended  Minor differences between Economy abd Premium Economy but it is these differences that make your journey more comfortable.

5877,"Not good for travel to Singapore and beyond from New York City Years ago Singapore Air had a direct flight from Newark/New York to Singapore. It was great! But they stopped that fight when they got rid of those planes. Now if you fly from New York to Singapore, you have to deplane in Frankfort, wait, and then get back on the plane AFTER going through German customs! A real pain. Last time flew I was flagged for drugs on the way home to New York. I am a photographer and had lots of equipment with me. They tore me apart, opening and emptying every bag of photo and computer stuff, making me remove every piece of equipment I had - only to realize that my sleeping pills were showing up as drugs. They were beyond nasty...
And Singapore Air's Frequent Flyer department is terrible. I wanted to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business. I was told to transfer the miles and it would be done closer to my trip.The part of my trip from Bangkok to Singapore and back was upgraded, but the Singapore/New York portion was not. When I got to Bangkok from Laos and tried to do the upgrade, I was told that it had to be done in Singapore. When I got to Singapore, I was told that it had to be done in Bangkok and they wouldn't do it.There were plenty of seats available in Business. I lost 40,000 miles because they wouldn't accommodate me! I haven't flown them since. I used to fly them on a regular basis.They lost a good customer! P.S. I traveled before 2018, but had to put a date on this review.",negative
359,"Flight from Dublin to Brisbane The first leg of our code sharing flight from Dublin was cancelled at the last minute to Frankfurt.
Got an email short time later from Singapore Airlines saying we were booked on an Emirates that night. Retrieved our luggage from another terminal and waited at Emirates counter for over 3 hours until their counter closed as Emirates said they never received authorization for our alternative flight tickets. Told to go to Swissport in Dublin who were great and arranged a hotel for the night. After getting to the airport hotel at 11-00pm we rang our travel agent back home shortly after who said she had to converse with Singapore Airlines for over 2 hours to arrange alternative flights. Finally got another flight home later the next day which went off without any problems albeit a day later. Our previous experience with Singapore Airlines has been great but this flight was incredibly stressful and we had a feeling of abandonment in Dublin due to a lack of communication from Singapore Airlines. Hopefully just a one off experience.",negative
284,Horrible experience in Business class By traveling Singapore airlines is my worst experience all my travel history.  I never experience such uncomfortable business class seats the bed is so hard while traveling i developed pain in my back there is no space to straight your legs one has to sleep on a angle i could not sleep in my journey.  There is very limited menu for the food specially for a vegetarian.  The Delhi Singapore staff is rude and service is very bad. I want Singapore airlines should refund my fair.

692,"Not what it used it used to be...shame shame Singapore used to be one of the best but has been going more and more down.
Tickets are sold a fortune but the food and service are only going down.
Luggages upon arrival wasn't there, got it next day, ok can happen, but I have learnt since then that Singapore airlines has actually been bumping luggages every day for a while and passengers each and every day are missing their luggage upon arrival (same thing happened on the same flight to a friend of me 3 weeks later and other 20 passengers, my flight we were about 15 not to have it)
This is not acceptable at all
Food who used to be good is very average to not good at all now.....
I couldn't even eat breakfast last time as it was really bad.
And when you want to change ticket, they are trying to force you to pay the highest rate and the rates are insane.
I don't like to travel with them anymore...it's really a pity.
Speaking to other passengers from other destinations and they told me also they this airline has been going way down and they do not wish to travel anymore with them.
See the only thing they want is to make money on the back of the customers.....

I paid for a full price, full service ticket - they clearly must have put operated by Scoot in very small writing somewhere, to say I'm upset is an understatement. I could have booked a Scoot ticket for $200, not the $800 I paid to not have to sit for 8 hours on a horrible plane. My whole trip is ruined, I've been having a really hard time and now I'm stuck on what is going to be a miserable flight. To cancel costs half the ticket price.

I am not a fan of airline food for the last 35 years or so and although the food both out and back was not to my taste, it was beautifully presented and served. I have to say that I could not speak more highly of the cabin crews. They were very pleasant, courteous and attentive. They made the unpleasantness of long haul flying as good as it could be. Well done to all of you both out and back. Seating was comfortable and allowed sleep which is a bonus for me.
Highly recommended and would be first choice for another trip.",positive
5683,"Best and most comfortable airline in the world Seats are roomy (unlike the wishbone coffin like seats of Cathay and other carriers). Aisles, seating area, and toilets are spotless (unlike Cathay and other carriers). Staff is extreme hospitable, gracious, polite and willing to look after passengers as their chargé d’affaire. This amount of painstaking detail cannot be found in any other carrier period. 

The pilots need to be commended most of all. The reason being is they arrived early not to chit chat but to speak with ground control across their path and to other arriving pilots which in turn helped them map out a proper flight path that was free of turbulence. In today’s day and age it is erroneous to blame turbulence on anything other than the pilot as it can be mitigated. We have ample satellites and monitoring stations that can outline the pockets of turbulence. Therefore on other carriers it is the pilot’s fault for plotting a rubbish flight path. As the pilots arrived too late adhering to their clock-in rather than their passion for flying. They never bothered to check with ground control along their path or with other pilots on said path. And so they just plot the quickest flight path that will garner them their additional incentive for saving fuel and arriving early; and that is much to the demise of passenger comfort. It is clear those pilots of other carriers such as Cathay have no business flying as they are not passionate about their vocation and are simply there to collect a pay cheque. They are for a lack of a better word - Dead wood that needs to be let go. 

The pilots of Singapore Airlines are TOP GUNS. They are passionate about their craft (pun intended) and put passenger comfort upfront and above their incentive.",positive
3576,Very comfortable flight Flying on SQ from Singapore to Perth was a breeze. The seats were comfortable. I was impressed by the little touches to enhance the comfort of travelers.

At no time did we feel uncomfortable, however, the passenger sitting in front of my husband reclined his seat, cramping the space that my husband had available, which he found annoying!
When we arrived back in Melbourne still on board the plane, our disembarkment was delayed by 15 minutes, due to a passenger requiring specialist medical attention. At no time during that flight were we aware that a passenger was experiencing health issues. Full marks to the stewards for attending to that person’s needs and protecting his/her privacy, without causing unnecessary stress to other passengers",positive
3279,"Disappointed Singapore Airlines has always been one of our most favourite airlines, but our last trip in September to Singapore wasn't too good and disappointed us considerably. We often go business class but because it was a sort flight during the day, we thought we would go economy and pay extra for extra leg room seats. We bought the ticket a number of months before our trip and selected our seats, then shortly before the trip they placed us further back in the plane.The service was terrible and I'll give you an example. About an hour or so before we landed my wife asked to be served a cup of tea. The attendant said they were about to serve a snack and my wife told her we didn't want the snack. She then walked away and came back to us with two cups of black tea and a milk. She then called for service and asked for super. She went away again and a few minutes later returned with the sugar. My wife then call for service yet again and asked for a teaspoon. All this could have been taken care of in a more efficient manner. The attitude was not consistent with SIA mantra of good service. The final thing which we have never experienced was when we were a short distance from our destination and an announcement came over the intercom telling us the immigration cards were required by Singapore visitors. Nothing happened in our section until I asked an attendant for a card for my self and my wife. He then left and a few minutes later the senior attendant informed us they ran out of the cards. Why didn't they say anything? No good Singapore Airlines. Came back to Sydney in Premium Economy and service was very good.",neutral

4917,"Overpriced for its service and food I usually fly SQ to support local whenever it's within my budget.

Since we have a 2 month old in tow and we will be living in BNE for number of years we decided to bite the bullet and stretch our budget to make our 7.5 hour journey a little more bearable.  

PAID, $3,987.8 for Economy for 3 return tickets, $174 for baby. 

BOOKING process was fairly simple and quick. Love the look and feel of the website. Calendar view with the prices, departure and arrival dates were very helpful.

SERVICE 
1. SIN to BNE Service was fantastic. Air stewards and stewardesses were extremely attentive. Our call bells, even accidental ones were attended to within 2-5 minutes. Meals were served to parents with infants first. This was especially helpful because cranky parents make bad customers. 

2. BNE to SIN Service was fair. There was an air stewardess serving our zone that was curt and sometimes rude. Didn't get her name but she was a little stubby. The second air stewardess that served us was very polite and personable.  Wasn't served first in this flight but it's not expected, I'm just comparing it with my previous flight. 

FOOD both flights served tasty food and the snacks were edible. I remember the pie from my BNE to SIN. The pastry was super tough to bite. A sandwich would've been better. But the taste was not too bad. It is a shame that the pastry was tough. 

DRINKS I love that SQ always have a wide selection of drinks. Wine, spirits, beer, soft drinks and juices.

TOILETS they are clean and maintained throughout the flight by the flight attendants. It is very commendable that they try their best to keep it fresh amongst the myriad of other responsibilities. Both flights were consistent in this.

AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT love the entertainment sets provided. Movies were loaded rather quickly. There was a good variety of movies, tv series, documentaries and games.  

AMENITY KITS we were given face towels before takeoff and an Amenity Kit. It includes a toothbrush, toothpaste and a pair of socks. The pouch looks good.     

Qantas/Emirates VS Singapore Airlines
I flew SIN to BNE on 30 June 2019 and I was stunned at the value that was given to us by Qantas vs SQ. We paid $1230.4 for 3 return tickets, $43 for the infant. Granted that we are flying in an older aircraft but the price difference is CRAZY. And I will be flying 4 times a year. Think about the savings I am getting by choosing Qantas. It is a sad because I really want to support local, but in Singapore, we are taught to be savvy. 

Before takeoff, we were given face towels and 3 packets of baby Amenity Kits (Blanket w toy, Pouch w Pigeon wet wipe, spoon and a disposable changing mat) and a small elephant backpack) WOW!

Food was tastier than the ones served in SQ both meals and sandwich were superb. But SQ serves their bread rolls warm (this is a super plus point). The Qantas flight attendants were not as attentive with call bells left unanswered for more than 15 minutes. But they were super friendly.

Toilet amenities were similar to the ones in SQ. Entertainment sets were fully loaded with so many things. 

CONCLUSION
My experience with SQ was great. But why should I fly SQ when I'm getting tickets from Qantas at less than half the price. With similar service and entertainment. Qantas wins the food category hands down.

I would stay with SQ once they start pricing right.",positive
6759,"As economy travel goes, pretty good For a three-hour regional flight, I doubt if we could have done better. The leg-room wasn't great, but the food was edible and the wine drinkable. We left on schedule and the timing was good, getting us to Singapore late afternoon. My only complaint would be that we didn't get the seats we had booked online. For our return leg, checking in online a good 36 hours before departure, all aisle seats were already booked. Still, I'd choose SQ over Cathay every time!",positive

8093,First class experience. I choose to fly KL to Mumbai via Singapore on first class in order to experience the world renowned airline. The flight from KL was on airbus 330 business class. It was short 45min on time flight. I had to change terminal in changi airport via shuttle inside the airport. Then proceed to lounge. There was a private room section in the lounge. Very few people were there and most of them were there for a short time. I had 5 and half hour lay over in the lounge. Wow! What an experience. Best wine and dine experience I’ve had. Then the flight from Singapore to Mumbai was an A380. It was a 5 hour flight. The first class was located on the lower deck of the aircraft. It was the second A380 of the Singapore Airlines.

Travelling every month on this sector for more than 26 years, I feel shortchanged. What SQ does not realise is that the moment another airline starts regular service on this sector, they will lose many premium passengers like me. I have been a PPS Solitaire passenger for more than a decade and it is sad that SQ has been under serving this sector for so many years.

These aircraft should have been retired a long time back.

Having said that, SQ is still the best airline in the world.",neutral
8815,"What is all the fuss about? I was looking forward to trying Singapore Airlines after it being rated so high. So I have to tell you, this is United with another name and equipment that is not as comfortable. First I was traveling only for a few days. I ALWAYS do carry on. When I checked in, they took my carry on away and told me that it was too heavy. New regulations. Ok. I didn't fuss too much but during board when others had bags almost twice the size of mine and obviously much heavier, I was upset. Next, the seat! Ok, it is nice and wide however the way it is structured you can only use part of it comfortably. Time to sleep...lie flat??? Oh yes, manual fold down which makes a HARD wooden bed for you to sleep on. I need to wash my hands. Ok...but no towels or anything in the washroom so I had to wipe them on my pants. All in all, not a stellar 5 star experience.",negative
6440,"At last, Singapore Airlines! Overall, very good service.
PROS: The toilets remained clean all throughout the flight. Flight attendants were helpful and attentive.
AVERAGE: Somehow I expected better food; this experience was only average in quality, in hotness arriving to your seat. No cheese, no bread, except for breakfast.
CONS: The bag of amenities was not at all exciting--a pair of orange socks with non-stick soles, a toothbrush, a tiny tube of toothpaste, and ear plugs.
Choice of films so-so.",positive
1907,"Disappointed  My husband and I were looking forward to our flight to New Zealand in Singapore airlines, however we were left somewhat disappointed. 
Although the crew were smartly turned out the service and care was left wanting. 
Rushed and inattentive. Drinks seemed to be sparse, food very average and when I was suffering with a headache and pressed the button to ask for some water, I waited over half an hour for someone to come and then they didn’t seem to understand and came back with some warm water! 
Airplanes were quite tired too. 
Found New Zealand airline far superior.",neutral

1084,"airlines with the best services? Services by the crew were not as good as I expected - despite promoting themselves as having the 'best services'. the food was not terrible but not great. the seats were not comfortable - I would say seats for Ryanair was better. 

I was also sitting next to the break room (?) for crew members so they were opening a bright lit room every few minutes throughout the 13 hrovernight flight, and I was unable to sleep. 

additionally, while the millage for my return flight was added, the millage to Singapore was not added so I contacted them only to get an answer 4 weeks later that the flight is 'not millage applicable'. Terrible wording of the whole email, no respect at all. I will never fly with them again.",negative

1692,"A perfect start to a long distance holiday This was the first leg of our holiday in New Zealand, a stop off in Singapore. Although we hadn't flown with Singapore Airlines before, they came well recommended. The reviewers didn't lie! This was one of the best long distance flights we've had. The aircraft (Boeing 777-300) was reasonably spacious, the food very good and the cabin crew excellent.

An overnight flight of 12 hours + was never going to be a sinecure. However, the staff made the whole trip very enjoyable. The in-flight entertainment was very good, with new-rease movies, and satellite box-sets available. We arrived safe and well in Singapore, ready to enjoy what this amazing city has to offer.

I was sitting in economy but I had reserved a seat with extra leg room as I am 6 foot 3 (193 cm). However, space was fairly good even in the ordinary seats. Entertainment system was great, large clear touch screen with over 90 english spoken movies, lots of other stuff to watch. Kids enjoyed all the video games controlled by the wire remote that is located in the seat. USB charging available. Headrest is moveable. Food was good for being airplane food, mostly asian dishes. Only down side with this fligth was the stop in Moscow where everyone including hand luggage had to leave the aircraft and pass through security. Felt like an unneccesary stop as not many new people left or entered the airplane. Stop was fairly fast, estimation 60-90 minutes.

2914,The size of this aeroplane was amazing On booking we selected and paid extra (minimal cost) for upstairs seats.This gave us peace of mind for a long overnight flight back home. No problems with the flight seats a bit hard but expected in economy.

FA's were as always excellent in fact we hardly saw them as it was overnight. I would not do their job for any salary.,positive
2970,Average experience. Our flight into Singapore was delayed and we missed our Air New Zealand connection to Auckland. Rebooked direct to Christchurch on Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy.

First time Premium Economy with Singapore and not the best experience.,neutral
6704,"Poor disclosure and terrible service We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines (SA) in economy class from LAX for 11/2018.  A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus.  Even indicated what was a “low” bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a “fair” chance.  Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats.  We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close.  We called SA but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken.  We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available.  We are in our 70’s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight.  One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom.  We suffered.  When we returned home, we found out SA would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy.  We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided.  They said “no”, terms and conditions protect them.  Beware of SA’s offers as they may not be what you expect, especially for an airline that touts their reputation.  We were extremely disappointed in their offer, service, and response!  First and last time we will fly with them.",negative

358,DIFFICULT TO CHANGE FLIGHT DATE BY PHONE We had a booking for 06 sept to fly to Paris and return to Melbourne from Rome. We needed to change the first leg Melbourne to Paris via Singapore date which you can only do via their call centre. It took approx 1.50 hours to change the date. The first person couldn't understand what we wanted so after 1 hour trying to get it sorted we hung up and called back again - different person who grasped what we wanted and sorted it out for us. The first girl wouldn't transfer us to anyone else and said there was no supervisor we could speak to - very poor service and I'd think twice about booking through Singapore airlines again - changes are just far too difficult.,negative

237,"Disappointing Singapore Airlines Premium Economy Singapore Airlines generally have a reputation for providing excellent service, and so we booked a Premium Economy flight SQ308 from Singapore to London, on 18 September 2023. Prior to this flight, we took a Scoot flight Melbourne to Singapore, again in Premium Economy, which was excellent, sitting in seats 1A and 1B.

The Singapore Airlines flight was disappointing in a number of areas.
We were not offered a glass of champagne on boarding, no flight menu was offered, no amenities kit, and very sparse service of drinks, in plastic cups (not glass). We had pre-ordered meals, my wife’s meal was first given to another passenger who opened it, realized it wasn’t theirs, and returned it to the hostess, who then read the correct seat number and offered it to my wife, opened!
I had to request more wine during the meal, it was not offered.

All in all, a most disappointing flight. We have Premium Economy flights booked on our return journey, not really looking forward to those.

I would chose QANTAS Premium Economy in the future. Not good enough Singapore!",neutral

981,"Disappointing I knew SG airlines are considered the best out of all but it was rather mediocre or sub par actually.
Food was rather bad and they never heat up bread so it was always cold. The stewardesses seemed annoyed when I asked for a beer or any other additional small service.
One girl didn't even understand the word ""butter"" and when I made a gesture of spreading on bread and she thought I was after jam and told me ""bread already sweet enough lah""and walked off
I wasn't angry or anything and took it as it is what it is but I was a little surprised. 
Well COVID changed everything and this probably is new normal. 
At least all my 4 flights arrived on time and I safely returned.",negative
7233,"Mr Well here is a sad tale of an oft recommended airline now ferociously mining for money rather than service .
20 years of patronage out of my own pocket , unpropped by corporations and tax relief , recently accepted my bucks for business class tickets for this route .
Owing to family sickness the date couldn’t be kept . Despite gold status the additional cost was 600 pounds per passenger  for what purported to be different class seats in , wait for it , the same business class seats that had already been paid for .
When asked to describe the actual difference in seats in this subclass there was no difference . Simply a penalty for circumstance and no room for the long term and previously loyal customer . And no , flyer points could not be used .
The impersonal , computer bound inflexibility when you are already paying top whack reduces Singapore to no better than the pack they purport to strut above .
I hear qantas has improved of late , they can take my money in future , and that of those I have encouraged to try Singapore in the past .
And I have been compelled to tell the world .this contrivance where there are an array of subclasses in business class calculated to trap the unwary and milk the unfortunate is quite scandalous . Naively thought they were better than that , nope , moneygrubbers .",negative

3054,"Red-eye flight DEL-SIN Departing 945 pm Delhi time. Boarding was a little chaotic, with Krisflyer Gold and Premium Economy boarding at the same line as Economy - don't know why they didn't queue separately. Flight was on A380 version 1, which has Suites in front, premium economy in the middle, and economy in the rear (both lower and top deck). Flight appaeared to be completely full. Crew were patient and friendly despite the normal chaos from an entirely full flight. As usual, a hot towel service pre-departure. We departed on time, and meal service started almost immediately - again, the crew coped pleasantly with somewhat demanding passenger load. IFE was the older KrisWorld system without touch screen, but adequate. Seats had adjustable headrests, and legroom was adequate. Cabin was noisy, though, as there were quite a few young children travelling with the ensuing noisy crying this sometimes entails. It was difficult to get enough sleep in Economy. Just prior to landing (about 40 mins), attendants did a quick sweep through the cabin to offer refreshments, which was much appreciated. Arrival on time, and with a very quiet landing.
It was difficult to get enough rest, but at the end of the day, this was a reflection of the passengers and full load rather than SQ. If you are lucky to get a much emptier plane (e.g. my Vistara outward flight), you may have a better experience. Nonetheless, score is for the product, not the experience. I have to say, though, that this leg was much more expensive than Vistara, so it depends whether you feel the premium is worth it.",positive

28,"First class food Travelled from Man to BKK via Singapore and return. Outbound flight was on an Airbus 590 with the skewed sleeping arrangement which I found to be most uncomfortable. Although the seat was wide it lacked support for the lower back and I thought that the TV screen was much too close to the seat. The flight from Singapore to BKK on the B787 was little better as the seat was very narrow and the partition dividing the seats made it feel very claustrophobic. Again, I found there to be a lack of lower back support. This time the TV screen was further away. The return flights were very similar.
However, where Singapore airlines does score highly is in the way that the cabin crew look after the passengers; service was superb and nothing was too much trouble. Food also was so much better than any other airline we have travelled on, especially the Book The Cook option. Also, the lounges, with the exception of the one in Manchester, were first class with an excellent choice of food available. Despite my criticism of the seats I would definitely fly Singapore again.",positive

But then he was asked to sit up for landing off.

My boy then cry out lound for nearly 15mins while the plane go around before landing off but the crew still don’t care at all. Later, he awake and can’t sleep again.

The Premium economy is just economy plus by a slightly extended seat. It is fine but not terribly impressive.  I took the night flight and booked the business to sleep well.

3349,""" SINGAPOOR"" Dont Fly Singapore if you are Coeliac or want to use the club lounge Having flown many airlines the expectation was high that Singapore would live up to the hype, they failed on all fronts, First  despite having checked when we joined, before we left and whilst we were away that access was available we were not allowed into the Kriss lounge at Heathrow as we were not Gold, but assured yes you can use the one in Singapore, Not the case.  ""Meals"" thats a joke if you are a coeliac, refer to the picuture of what was actually provided vs the claimed menu as provided by Singapore airlines.  As I don't drink alcohol it was necessary to chase up a soft drink as nothing was supplied at the time of the meal.  Surely they could have supplied some rice or something for the flight.
CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST
•	Fruit Appetiser: Seasonal fruit. 
•	A portion of margarine
•	Diabetic jam
•	Non-dairy creamer

DINNER 
•	Hors D'oeuvre: Buckwheat salad, canned pear slices, sliced roasted chicken thigh and shaved pink radish
•	Main course: Beef, thyme and onion stew, roasted rough cut potato, roasted pumpkin and sautéed peas and onion
•	Dessert: Exotic puree with lemon verbena jelly and poach pineapple with lemon verbena.

2824,"A game of two halves We have flown Singapore Airlines many times and think is a great airline. This review is about the first and last legs on a trip to the Maldives via Singapore . We went  Premium Economy and were fortunate to be upgraded to Business Class on the return. The contrast between the two Is huge. If you think of the pricing (Premium Economy is double Economy and Business is double Premium Economy), you might expect the value to reflect the same. But it doesn’t. Flights attendants are great in all classes, so it’s not about the quality of service. The standard of food offered was the biggest difference. Inedible in Premium Economy, delicious in Business. Second is the seating for overnight travel. Sort of OK in Premium  Economy, fantastic in Business.  So, if your doing the Australia - Singapore flight do it during the day and fly Economy. If you are travelling further overnight and can afford it, go Business - if you can’t afford Business go Premium Economy. 
For all airlines offering Premium Economy, the offering needs to be upped a bit to match the price point. Having said that I’ll opt to fly Premium Economy most times for that little bit of leg room and a quieter section of the plane. 
Still love Singapore Airlines, just a little (probably very expensive for them) tweak would make a huge difference.",positive

It was hundreds less than British and American Airlines. The flight was 3/4 full so was able to sit alone. Seats are comfortable and planes are clean. Food is ok if you enjoy Asian cuisine. This flight goes to Singapore so if you don’t like Asian cuisine, then bring your own food.  The staff is not as friendly as other cross Atlantic airlines.  I could be wrong but it is as if they don’t appreciate UK travelers.  Manchester airport is over crowded during holiday season so give yourself enough time between your flights.  If your UK flight is with FlyBe be forewarned if you have carryon luggage. They changed their policy so it is comical how they charge extra for those bags that typically can be carryons on other airlines.  If prices increase, then I will not fly Singapore to UK!",neutral
