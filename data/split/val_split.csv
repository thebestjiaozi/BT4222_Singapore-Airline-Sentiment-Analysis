4756,"Disappointing! Having flown with Singapore Airlines previously and been happy I was extremely disappointed this time. Flying economy, the seating and legroom was as expected. The cabin service could not be faulted. The food however was extremely disappointing(to put it mildly) on the Adelaide-Singapore leg, and even worse on the Singapore-Milan leg. And the return flights worse again! : dry rubbery fish- sauce only half covered it, flavourless, watery, overcooked vegetables, flavourless pasta entree( no sauce or topping?) followed with what looked to be same pasta in main course(?) ; dry, stale rolls......Whilst I do not have high expectations for in flight food, I do expect edible food and don't expect to describe it as DISGUSTING. I cannot help compering it with the surprisingly excellent meal we had with Air Maroq flying Casablanca to Rome ( which also had amazingly good leg room.) The only good thing with dinner was the tea, which was excellent. My advice, take some substantial snacks, and if time permits, eat at Changi Airport. Mmmm.....Most disappointing.  Gone from good to poor rating.",negative
7359,"Excellent flight -shame about the food. The only thing that stopped me rating this airline as excellent was the quality of the food. We had booked in as vegetarians and we got vegetarian food, but much of it was almost inedible. Service was excellent. In flight entertainment was varied  with a great choice and the flight itself was comfortable and relaxed.",positive
9949,"Great service, great food Pleasant daytime flight in economy. Seats comfortable. Had order bland meals for dietary reasons and the breakfast,lunch and dinner were all very tasty. Checkin at Sydney airport was quick and baggage readily available in Hanoi when we arrived. Plenty of water and juice available throughout flight. Staff friendly.",positive
340,"Luggage I arrived on June 12, 2023.
I got my luggage the next day June 13, 2023 around 6:30 pm.
Also my luggage was in bad condition: the handle was broken, can not push up&down all the way, and can not use anymore. The Singapore Airlines isn't responsible anything.",negative
7939,"3 hours of delay  The outbound flight to Osaka was on time but the inbound back to Singapore there was a delay of 3 hours. Reason given was late arrival of aircraft which I thought wasn’t good enough as the flight time between the 2 destinations is only 6 hours or so? We were informed of an hour delay by sms and only learned of a further 2 hours when we arrived at the airport. Though they provided a refreshment coupon, it was still tiring for a red eye flight. This is not a common experience though when taking SQ in the past.",neutral
9637,"Flying High There is a reason Singapore has won airline of the year or have been in the top 10. Their service is absolutely first class, from the captain giving us updates to the cabin crew that really and truly look after you for the duration of the flight. Flew on the A380 on the way to Singapore and it's still a marvelous aircraft to travel on. The cabin crew are extremely friendly and are more than accommodating to meet any needs required. The IFE (In Flight Entertainment) is fantastic, you're not going to run short of options here, you can watch TV, films, listen to music to your hearts content. All in all it is a great airline to fly on and hopefully I'll be flying with them again soon.",positive
6214,"Long Haul Comfort It is a long haul, 14 hrs, so an upgrade to premium economy seemed worthwhile, cost about £300 each extra. Plane was a brand new Airbus 350 900, nice. Premium economy is a 2 4 2 seating plan with only 3 /4 rows available in premium economy. Plenty of room and seat recline on this plane and seat class is a slider so that rather than a back rest hinging back towards you the seat in front slides so that the seat in front only intrudes 2 inches. Food and drink a notch up from economy and usual Singapore quality. Noise cancelling headphones supplied and very good quality. In flight entertainment very good. Plenty of overhead locker space here. A sleeping mask would have been nice as it is not included in the pack. I did get one on a previous flight by asking for one so carry it with me now.",positive
5816,"First Time Flying with Singapore Airlines It was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines from Kul to Dubai transit in Changi and vice versa..Based on this experience, i would say it's nice airlines with friendly cabin crew but just i did not satisfied with only earphone, pillow and blanket for economy class passenger. Unlike other airlines i have traveled with, (i.e. E), there were many complimentary provided even for economy class passenger which amazed me so much till now!! That's the comparison and you can say i am a BS! Regarding the food, it was acceptable, heated except for snacks i.e. sandwiches and the buns in main meal which were served cold! Regarding on flight entertainment, the selection of movies also very limited and some Chinese / Korean movies were shown without English subtitles. No free WiFi on board except you have to purchase and pay them. Anyway, Singapore Airlines can be improved more and i hope can fly again with you someday... Thanks!",neutral
6690,"Travelled with family of 10 We travelled with a group of 10 and were able to find places next to each other.
Overall they all enjoyed the flight.",positive
2004,"I like to use this airline In economy on this flight, it was still very comfortable.  Economy is a little better that other airlines, you didn't feel too close to the seat in front and get that ""claustrophobic"" feeling.  A choice of meals served by friendly hostesses/stewards. Good choice of In-flight entertainment, something for everyone.",positive
3931,"Sydney to London via Singapore My flight was in mid August. The flight to Singapore seemed to be in a newer aircraft but not being an expert on these things, I don't really know.

The crew were absolutely delightful.

The food seemed a bit ordinary and I am not sure whether this is because I ordered vegetarian oriental for the Sydney-Singapore flight. From Singapore to London, I had Indian vegetarian - again a bit bland. Not what you'd expect for Asian food on aircraft, it usually fares better than Western.

I noticed during the service that they only serve water or drinks in the plastic cups e.g. if you have a can of coke, they pour the coke into the plastic cup and retain the can. Also the same with water. I much prefer it if they hand out small bottles of water or large bottles of water. I like to drink a lot of water on flights, so it a problem having to ask for plastic cups of water all the time. I learnt from this on the return flight and retained an empty water bottle that I could fill at the fountain. I've got no idea why they are so stingy with the drinks.

The wine is awful too. Why don't they serve some decent Australian or New Zealand wines - when buying in bulk they are not that expensive to buy. instead they've got this Chilean rubbish which gives you a headache.

The aircraft from Singapore to London seemed an older aircraft and the entertainment equipment was not so easy to use.

Overall I don't think it's as good as British Airways (that did surprise me!) or Qantas.

I noticed passengers getting on with very large cabin bags. One couple had enormous bags which would not have fitted in the overhead cabins and they put them under their feet. There's no way they would fit under the seat in front. I pitied the passenger sitting next to them. The woman had her bag sort of stored on the window sill which meant she had hardly any room left in her seat. There's no way Qantas would allow that!",positive
6592,Mrs Service is good compared to other airlines. Economy class is unfortunately always cramped. But with a long flight it helps to have good service. Friendly and attentive staff members. Changi airport is also an excellent few hour stop over. Lovely outdoor gardens and relaxation spots.,neutral
4448,"A Standard Above As a regular traveller to Bali and wider Indonesia I have become well accustomed to the Low Cost (read tight arse airways) offering.  I wear cheap air flights like a badge of honour and frankly would sit on a milk crate from Perth at the right price.  

When it came to visiting Sri Lanka however I was looking for a higher level of comfort and service.  8 plus hours airtime and stopover for connection made comfort a priority.

What a fantastic experience we had.  The aircraft was a cut above anything the Low Cost carriers provide.  Cleanliness, comfort and smell were all fantastic.  Plus add the constant flow of service and hospitality, we were really well treated.  My travelling partner was intrigued by the entertainment system and the wide range of content for viewing and listening.  At 67 years old he wasn’t interested in the games console.

On the return trip in particular we enjoyed one of the new wide body airliners that was just amazing.  Comfort and quiet were the hallmarks of this experience.  There were plenty of spare seats and very soon after take off a cabin steward invited me to the row behind to give our crowded 3 row more room.  As a broad shouldered rugby player, this gesture was warmly received by me and those travelling next to me.  Again the hospitality and service flowed throughout.

In closing what a great ride.  It’s not often that the flight itself is ever much of a trip highlight.  On this occasion just like the Test Match victory over Sri Lanka, it certainly was.",positive
9142,"lots of room in Business class seats Flew actually several SQ flights in Aug/Sept 2018 in Singapore Air Business(LAX-SIN-Jakarta; Bali - Singapore to LAX:  Great service. roomy seats -- very much so;  miserable way for lie flat seats -- at 45 degree angle.  Who sleeps at home at a 45 degree angle.    Also, food quality has deteriorated over the also 3 years.  My steak was tough and tasteless.  For the price Singapore air charges, they could give high quality, tasty food.  SQ saves money since we really can't send food back to the kitchen while on board.   Row 15, bulkhead is-great lie flat seat IF a person is less than 6 feet tall; otherwise a tall person has to fold his/her legs to fit in the seat.  My wife, being shorter than I found it very comfortable; I changed seats b/c I could not fit in comfortably.",neutral
4967,"Service as promised! We took a chance to travel by this airlines as much were written by the media.

Well, no regrets as the departure and arrival on time.  The plus points - good service throughout the journey! The stewardesses were smiley, ever ready to serve despite it was an overnight flight.

The toilets were refreshed and dried with the usual amenities.

Keep up the good service and will definitely travel with Singapore Airlines again in the near future.",positive
6253,"Supposed to be a pleasant flight Was on my usual SQ380 9.55am flight to Hong Kong for my business trip. All was fine till the plane took off. The aircon vent started leaking & dripped all over my t-shirt. After trying to avoid the leakage, & the seat belt sign is off. I pressed the service button but no crew responded. In the end I need to inform the chief stewardess & she told me it sometimes happens on A380. But I've took A380 quite often but this is the first time I encountered such incident. In the end, I got a seat switch to a front row which is supposed to be more premium (but it's right in front of the toilets :-( However, I still appreciate the effort of the chief stewardess..",neutral
4353,"Slight let down I’ve travelled with Singapore airlines previously and it was great, with flight and service.  Unfortunately this time their standard has dropped, not in service but quality of meals.   You would think I’d be served with Singapore cuisine but instead served with Turkish food.   Wasn’t good food.   I was also slightly concerned with the landing as it was slightly rougher than normal considering weather conditions were ideal.   I’m hoping it was a one off situation but overall it’s a good airline.",positive

5056,"Perfect My first trip on A380 was perfect. Got upper deck seats. Upper deck is quieter as compared to lower deck(travelled in Lower deck on return). You have a personal storage space right next to window seat which can hold upto 10 kgs. 

Smooth checkin. Good and clean aircraft with good ambient lighting. Crew immediately handed hot towels, blankets & ear phones. Drinks were offered after take off. Meal was equally good. Crew was attentive throughout the flight.

Decent leg room and timely arrival were other highlights. 

Overall a very nice experience. Recommended to travel upper deck if flying A380.",positive
6692,"Amazing airline It was an absolute delight to fly SingaporeAir to Singapore and then onwards to Cambodia. Although I flew economy the air stewardesses were attentive to my needs, caring and accommodating. The film menu was great with a good size screen and kept me entertained for the 14+ hours and the leg room was adequate. I wish they would fly to more destinations. I have given this a “Very good” rating only because I flew  economy as I’m sure business and first class would be amazing. I would definitely recommend.",positive

3966,"Best World airline company I flew many airlines in my life, but Singapore Airlines is the best ever: Unlike other airlines (i/e: Air France ) and for a long haul flight:With Air France, all starts at the aircraft entrance, the attendants hardly smile and stare at your ticket instead of smiling at you right in your eyes. Then vaguely show you the direction with a poor English.  The worst is when the cabin crew starts to speak in English..? In English? really, my Australian partner does not understand half of it ! And that goes on, lunches or snacks are being served at full speed, and if by bad luck you have been served among the last… Not only your main course choice is limited , but the attendants collect your tray and garbage at full speed also! … Then they disappear for hours without seeing them for half of he flight time… If you have a chance to stand up, walk along the corridors and fetch a bottle of water at the rear, you must apologise to disturb the crew having their dinner or stopping a good chat of theirs.. etc..  No need to say that with Singapore Airlines, it is totally the opposite !

I also greatly appreciate the “Stop over” package deal they propose  once in Singapore so you can have a good shower, dinner out and a good sleep before flying for an additional 8 x hours to Sydney.   What else?",positive

3625,"A short relaxing flight I booked my family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) on SQ using KF miles. So in the end I only had to pay $200+ in cash. It would have cost me $300+ if I did book us on low cost carriers so it wouldn't have made sense to do that. I won't talk about my self-service check in experience as that always irritates me so I'll jump straight to the flight. Boarding was a breeze as it was an A350-900 which was <50% full. So the kids were happy with the space and so was I. The plane was new and clean and all the equipment was in working order. The highlight for me was when we were about to land in KUL, the steward not only asked us politely to lower the arm rest but also took the trouble to explain why we had to do it. I was appreciative of his patience as most of the time we are just ordered to lower the arm rests in the tone of a prison warden telling his inmates to do it. So thank you SQ. You have certainly hired the right steward for this job.",positive

There were 3 of us on the front row.  Everything felt just a bit jaded and not very comfortable.  What really irked me was that we took off at 9am (i.e daylight) and flew through the day to land at 3.30 pm however the stewards had all the blinds down the entire time which just made the 14 hour experience dispiriting and depressing.  I don't know why they did this and the next bit forward in the cabin didn't have this.  One of the lavatories was not working so there were pretty much constant queues, and the food was not great.

In Singapore, I had a shower in the lounge - quite a trial.......I waited half an hour for the shower room, & then had a hot sweaty experience in a poorly lit space.......perhaps the execs in Singapore Airlines should try having a shower in the Emirates lounge in Dubai?    Apart from this, it was really nice - particularly liked ordering my meal in advance, which worked really well.......was quite nervous about ordering lobster thermidor but it was really good & the appetisers & starters from the cabin menu were very good. Cabin crew were best ever - I called for service a couple of times & a member of staff was at my seat instantly - BA take note!

The seafood noodle smelled bad and my son would only eat one bite of the seared lamb because it tasted like wood. Since SQ is charging such extraordinary rates for business class I hope that they can at least serve more decent food, like many years ago. Recently I’ve flown on Japan Airlines, Eva and Cathay and honestly the food served was pampering and comforting. Staff service on SQ was still excellent and in flight entertainment were good but the food is simply unacceptable. Recently tried to book a flight to on line to HK and a cpu glitch made me come back to rebook the same flight. All of a sudden the price jumped by 15 percent. That upset me as I think they are doing pricing changes based on my previous booking so I decided to take Cathay Pacific instead for my upcoming trip. Please stop upsetting and losing your customers Singapore Airlines.",negative
5344,"Bed Bugs need I say anymore We recently had a flight from Hanoi to Singapore. When we got to our seat on the plane and we noticed a few bugs on our seat. These turned out to be bed bugs as the plane was full, we could not be changed seats. My partner gotten bitten by these bugs. We left the staff on the plane know and apparently they field a report. We decided to file our own report with Singapore airlines and they have been trying to hide the issue by giving  us a voucher which we have not accepted. They do not care about their customers at all. Our advice would be to book with the Middle Eastern airlines as they provide better service, clean planes and nice food. They provide first class service to economy passengers. Unfortunately as we had a round the world ticket we could not change to thaws airlines. 

We had a connection flight to Amsterdam from Singapore. We had another flight from Amsterdam to Ireland. We landed and we only had 1 hour to make our flight to Ireland. We asked the air host if she could give us the details of our gate and she was like no, figure it out yourself. We told her we had a very tight deadline to make our flight. Luckily we had data on our phone to find our gate when we landed. Other airlines usually provide you with details of your flights before you land if you have a short connection.

I cannot understand how they are the best airline in the world.",negative
1852,"Good flight Good, routine flight.  Check in etc - no problems. Small delay in departure but time made up whilst in the air.  Crew friendly and efficient, food okay.

8299,Change to different airline My wife and I were fortunate enough to get a good price to fly First Class to Singapore enroute to Osaka. We were fed up with Emirates poor service so wanted to try something different. We definitely struck excellent attentive service the food suited our western tastes and the comfort was exceptional. The staff were not intrusive but did try and go the extra mile to see we received great value for money. We very much agree the extra cost in this instance was well worth it and would recommend this airline to anybody tossing up whether to fly business or first class. Joe,positive
2685,"Wonderful service Recently I took two flights with Singapore airlines, one in economic class and one in premium economic class.
The services in both flights were perfect, they reminded me of how were the flights with Swissair and Lufthansa 30 years ago.
I felt that the flight attendants were there to serve me, always smiling , always running to fulfill my requests, never tired.
I can say that for the short and medium time ( 5 hours) flights, the service at economic class of Singapore airlines  is better than that at business class with Lufthansa.
I received all the newspapers I required. The meals were good, starting with a cocktail at economy class ( and I chose a complicated one ) and champagne at premium economic, with written menus with two choices.
Very good entertainment program with a good selection of films and classic music.
I am a M@M Lufthansa Senator member, so I fly a lot and I can compare services.",positive

6815,"World's best airline... sometimes, depending on where you are going! It really depends on where you're going. No complaints on the European sectors of our trip - the planes were new and clean and everything was great, definitely a great experience. The Australian sectors however seemed neglected. The planes were old with a grubby, tired interior, uncomfortable seats, outdated IFE technology (no touch screens... on the world's best airline... in 2019!?), and even the food was noticeably worse on these sectors. It's also the only full-service airline I've flown that doesn't serve dinner at the beginning of an overnight flight to Australia - there was only a small greasy pizza snack, making it seem very ""budget airline"".

Boarding was efficient except in Sydney. The staff were great on all flights, always friendly and helpful. The drinks services between meals were few and far between however and some flights didn't have them at all, which is another thing many other airlines handle much better.",neutral

The food was really good, from the starters to desert i ate all of it. The seat was very comfortable even seated upright, the leather was comfy and felt nice to the touch. I had no issues with my baggage, or any of their staff at check in or boarding. Even the safety video for this airline is one of my favourite to watch, as it shows the great sights around singapore. I would love to fly with them again soon.",positive
1333,"Longest Scheduled Flight in the World We took this flight last December. I must admit, I was slightly concerned about the length of the flight, which averages 18.5 hours. But as both a pilot and seasoned traveler, I also was well-familiar with the cabin of the A350, and knew that even in Premium Economy, I was likely to be reasonably comfortable. (On this flight, SIA only offers Business and PE.) 

The hard product was solid, just as I knew it would be. The pitch and width of the seats, coupled with the generous recline, made the flight mostly pain-free. The “book the cook” option, amenity kit, and generally solicitous service made the trip as pleasant as possible. The crew are not only professionals, but also clearly proud of their five-star reputation—and it showed. 

I would recommend this flight; though I’d also point out that there is no other choice for a nonstop NYC-Singapore flight. Although it isn’t too difficult to get up, walk around, and stretch from time to time, I would suggest business class if you can afford it. The ability to lie down, stretch, and sleep horizontally would have been even better.",positive
226,"Side Seats are more preferable on A380 I had a wonderful time flying with Singapore Airlines (PVG-SIN) SQ 833 on 9th September 2023.

The craft of service was Airbus 380, on my previous review i had mentioned that the middle seats are a little uncomfortable since one has to pull out the foot rest and cannot enjoy it while taxing takeoff and landing. In the side seats there is a natural cushioned footrest on the side crease which is comforting throughout the flight. (It is fixed and needs not to be pulled or pushed).

The F&B service and the crew is very polite and caring. The F&B selection is was good on this flight, but sometimes its really not upto the mark.

One can even try and book the front row seats which have a very comfortable and wide front den for foot rest.

1891,"Premium Economy Class like a regular Economy Class This flight has no regular economy. So, they call the class behind Business Class Premium Economy. Other than slightly more leg room, the seats are narrow. Meals are served as economy class with only two choices of entree. It comes with half a cloth napkin. Quality of food is equal to domestic US flights when they were providing hot meals. When compared to ANA and British Airways, Singapore's food is ranked the third. There were two meals served on this 15 hours flight. The second meal which was also a dinner was served without a dessert. Flight attendants are friendly and efficient. Always have a smile on their faces. The plane (A350-900) is new. We arrive Changi Airport 6+ hours before flight time and we were checked in so that we don't have to drag our luggage for hours. Boarding in Singapore is odd. Each gate has its own security screening for carry-on. Once you are in, there is no restroom facility inside the gate. Boarding was smooth and departure was right on time.",positive
8542,"Poor customer service I had to call multiple times just to select seats. I called them whatever time they asked me to call. Singapore Airlines simply did not allow online seat selection. The representatives told me they have to call back to Singapore to get permission for seat assignments which I found ridiculous. STOP doing business in USA if you need permission from Singapore just for assigning seats. After so many phone calls, they gave us seats at the rear end. I do not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines.",negative

But the flight attendants were so professional and so amazing. If I ever get the opportunity to fly overseas again, I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines.",positive
5152,"Seat location is important Singapore Airlines provide a really nice service but you will need to check where you are sitting before the flight. If you need to go to the toilet a lot, then an aisle seat is easier. Try not to sit right at the back as the seats don't seem to lay back enough and the attendants were out of some food items by the time we were served. Our flight to Singapore was great on a newer plane but the trip home was on an older plane that was not as spacious. We also found the overhead luggage compartments were full where we were sitting for the trip home and needed to place our carry on luggage down the aisle further which made getting off an issue to stop mid way down the aisle. For the trip over, we boarded in order of seating which was great but on the way back, they boarded everybody. (Could have been where the lack of storage came from). I expect that most of the passengers on the way back to Adelaide may have had more things such as gifts and souvenirs). Overall, the flight was OK.",positive
6136,A380 is a comfortable flight However with 400 or so passengers it is important that toilets are kept clean and properly supplied.   We were surprised to find that on this flight this was not the case in contrast to previous flights with this airline.  A pity.,neutral

The Premium Economy seat on their new Airbus A350 is by far the best premium economy comfort I've yet experienced. Although it's not up to business class standards, it's a massive step up from regular economy and worth the extra if you can afford it. The cabin service from the crew was also very good.

9006,"Making a trial bearable It's a l-o-n-g way! After doing the trip on Emirates economy last year, I thought that there had to be a better way. SAL economy plus was a great improvement. Even with the occupants in front  trampolining on full recline for most of the trip my (6'1"") knees had some space. Baggage drop off and boarding were so much better, too. Food was varied, hot and ample, whilst Catherine looked after us in a personal way and made excellent Singapore Slings. The other cabin staff were pleasant and helpful, particularly the manager.
The seats, unsurprisingly, became harder by the hour, whilst the economy plus cabin was remarkably quiet, though full. The Airbus on the second leg was much more pleasant than the Boeing 777 of the first leg. On that, all that could be seen out if the window was the wing and, being located near the engine exhausts, the noise was bad. The Airbus seating was in front of the wings and engines.
I don't dread the return trip like I did last year.",positive

High quality headphones was provided with he IFE.

So I got her a cup of tea and said we wouldn't worry about eating because Breakfast would be served on the plane. Breakfast on the plane was very disappointing. No hot food just some airline buns and croissants. And this is business class for a 6am flight?
Inflight entertainment was ordinary as well.",positive

5290,"the long long flight Flight took off at 2330 hours and as passengers in the packed plane settled for some sleep about 2 hours later, the pilot announced that the plane was heading back to Singapore because of  technical issue. Eager queries were made to the cabin crew about connecting flights, reason for turning back, and delay in appointments. Only after sometime was it revealed that the flight team has found the oxygen mask not in operation mode, and after deliberation it was decided that the best option was to fly back to Singapore, where the airline will try to get another plane to replace this.

Only when we reached Singapore we were informed that a replacement was arranged to fly us to Spain a few hours later. The SIN to BCN trip is about 12 hours, add in another 9 hours, it was 21 hours flight!

I couldn't go and buy another suitcase.  Only 2 suitcases at 50 pounds.  So I had to pay for a different flight on a different airline that day and change all my plans.

I was never able to actually speak with  Customer Service only email over days.",negative
6221,"Is it worth flying Premium Economy? I had major surgery about 18 months ago, and I was worried how I would feel on this flight, so decided to upgrade to Premium Economy instead of our usual Economy seats.  This more than doubled the cost.
Our flights were from London Heathrow to Singapore and back.  The flight to Singapore was on an Airbus 380, and we returned on a Boeing 777.
Service by the stewardesses was very good.  We were 15 minutes late arriving at Singapore (stacked for 30 minutes), and about 30 minutes early arriving at London.
Check in was very quick, and staff were helpful when they saw I was disabled.  At Heathrow we were directed to the first class check in because he was free.  His first question to us was ‘Can you climb the steps?’  We asked what steps, he replied with gestures to indicate that I needed to climb stairs.  We couldn’t get him to explain what he meant, so we said I could climb a few steps (true), and this satisfied him.  I have no idea what he was talking about, I didn’t see any stairs until we had been in Singapore for some hours!  I would have hoped first class check in would use staff fluent in English in England.
Online check is clumsy compared to other airlines, time-consuming and difficult (updates were very slow, we had to repeatedly wait for the Airline to update the page). The URL given in the e-mail is incorrect, I used Google to find the correct page.
So what were the benefits of Premium Economy?  The seats on the 2 planes were identical, but I preferred the remote control of the entertainment system on the Boeing.  The extra legroom was very welcome.  Seat width was better than I expected.  Although the seat itself is only slightly wider than in Economy, the gap between the seats is much wider, so you are a lot further from your neighbour.  The large video screen made watching films very enjoyable, and the headphones were high quality, cutting out most of the cabin noise.
You leave the plane before the Economy class passengers, and your luggage comes off the plane first, so you may get out of the airport more quickly.
Meals are served on the same type of tray used in Economy.  We tried book the cook menu.  First problem was the website, took ages before I worked out where to go.  We weren’t impressed on our flight to Singapore.  We were served before anybody else, and I had eaten a lot of the meal before I was finally able to get a glass of wine.  Both meals had too much meat, and almost no vegetables.  I decided to cancel our return meals, but the problem with the website…
This time I did get wine quickly, but the meals were disappointing.  I ordered nasi lemak, and chicken rice.  We had nasi lemak the previous evening, a simple cheap meal from a van in Gardens by the Bay, it was a much better meal.  The chicken rice was very basic, a typical SGD4 meal!  I got better in Singapore.  We won’t use book the cook again.
So what are the disadvantages?  First the Premium area is very small, and demand is high.  So we had to accept poor flight times both ways.  Our return from Singapore was awful.  We left Singapore about 1pm, and reached London at about 2am Singapore time!  I couldn’t get any better times without paying a lot more.  
A minor irritation for me is that all the Premium seats are over the wing.  I find it relaxing to watch the world go by, but that’s out if you fly Premium.
Finally the toilets.  I always find this an unpleasant problem, coping with standing in a queue (I find that difficult).  In Economy I tend to sit near the back toilets, which often have a small queue (most use the ones further forward).  But this problem is much worse with the Premium seats.  You are a long way from the toilets.  On the 380 you can only use the 2 toilets on your side of the plane, a good laugh when 2 people in front of you take over 10 minutes!  Yes for better toilet access, fly Economy.
So there you have it.  The extra space and better entertainment are great, but in all other ways I’d say save your money and fly Economy.",positive
6688,"Disappointment with a Top Marquee Airline Having travelled from London to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines which was excellent our return journey was very disappointing. The class of aircraft had been changed and we flew on both legs on much older aircraft . The booking staff at SingaporeAir were excellent in accommodating our seating arrangements and the crew were helpful but the plane was just old and tired compared to our outward journey. We were sat at the back of the plane with young children and the turbulence was quite unsettling, this wasn’t the fault of the airline but was uncomfortable in this older plane. An additional point is the skywards scheme run by Singapore Airlines is ridiculous and we had our previous air miles taken away within two years not that they could have been used for much . We have now flown to Australia twice with this carrier and should have enough miles to at least be offered something worthwhile but now we have one trip removed, I tried speaking to the customer service dept but they were just not interested. Will definitely give another carrier a chance for our next trip I am afraid to say .",neutral

7509,"Declining returns Having flown with SQ for a couple of decades my last trip confirmed what has been a trend for quite some time. Although SQ is no doubt a very good airline technically speaking, it does not quite live up to the image it built up during the 70s and 80s. On most flights cabin staff are absolutely competent but the personal touch has been lost. Maybe it is simply due to the size of the airline but I have a feeling it is rather a combination of a lower affinity to service oriented jobs in general and the failing of training to address this. The fact of the matter is that there are airlines, even from even richer countries than Singapore, that do a better job at motivating staff to proactively make the travel experiences better rather than to simply tick boxes.",positive

3557,"A bit below expectations Singapore Airlines has an excellent reputation, and I have had good experience flying it in the past.  On my flights to Bali from HK with stopover in Singapore, overall experience was a bit below my lofty expectations.  Sure enough, service is prompt and courteous, and always efficient.  Flights were generally on time.  However they seemed to like the cabins to be very cold, the entertainment selections were rather bland, and on my return flight from Bali to HK, the gentleman at the check-in counter checked my baggage all the way to HK, not realizing that I have a 1 day stopover in Singapore - he made the very elementary mistake of not asking me what my destination for the day is.  Fortunately I caught the mistake, but one of the bags had already gone down the conveyor belt - they had to track down the bag and reroute it (which to their credit was done correctly).  The food ranges from mediocre to very bad - one of the meal included the worst tasting mashed potato I have ever had as well as very tough meatballs.  But then I realized that they were serving a full meal for a 2 hour flight from Bali to Singapore: many airlines would have served something  simpler or even nothing at all.  And on the flight from Singapore to Hong Kong we were served moon cakes: a nice touch since it was the day before Mid-Autumn Festival in HK, but the moon cakes tasted pretty bad.  So not for lack of trying, but the food left much to be desired.  Legroom was good, and overall board experience generally good.  Not five stars unfortunately.",positive

775,"Premium economy no different to economy (except in price) We had flown Premium Economy with AirNZ and expected something similar from their Star Alliance partner. However, we were very disappointed. Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines is just an expensive version of economy; the food is the same, there are no separate bathrooms, and there is barely any more room available. The service was not great either and we would avoid flying with Singapore Airlines again unless we had no other option.",negative

8909,"I Wish They Flew EVERYWHERE I am now spoiled or simply basking in the memory of what air travel used to be.  Check-in was a breeze and the entire crew treated everyone with the utmost courtesy and caring.  We were provided a pillow, blanket, socks, toothbrush/toothpaste, two meals, and snacks, all at no extra cost. We were given ear buds/wire to connect to the screen on the back of the seat in front of us to watch a dizzying array of movies, TV shows, games, interactive games, flight information, or to listen to a multitude of music choices, again at no extra cost.  I felt there was more leg room and seats reclined further.  All this for an Economy fare. This was the FIRST time I've been able to sleep on a plane.  The plane was a Boeing 777 and even the bathroom was a bit larger with a baby changing table that folded down from the wall.  I have taken long flights in the past and none has compared to this one.

But most of all is the neatness and apearance, of the staff and of course the friendly faces.

Even under pressure of serving a meal between Singapore and Jakarta, there was not one serious face.

Encouraging is how the senior cabin staff helps out and give support.

758,"Poor customer service all over - downfall of an airline It seems that Singapore Airlines is focusing on business and first class clients only. Economy clients do not play a role in their service strategy at all. Anymore. Once a very service oriented and reliable airline it seems to fall behind average.

Service Center – a nightmare
For some reason our paid for seats were changed by the system and there was nobody who was able to help in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable amount of time. It took hours of multiple  dialing in and waiting. The service centers in Europe and Australia are not reachable for hours. Very long holding patterns in Europe. The dial in options are limited. You need to very patient.
Unfortunately, the service representatives are way over their heads. They are not able to change anything without the consent of their bosses. Promised return calls were not made. 
At the end we had to accept a worse seating solution than what we paid for. A better solution was never offered. A return of pay was not offered.

On board service - average
The post C19 rules have been dropped. Boarding is as you please. Very chaotic at times. Boarding takes forever.
None of our 4 flights from Europe to Australia and back was on time – none!
Food quality has suffered tremendously. The taste, the texture and the temperature of food is average – best case.
The A350 is a very loud and poorly climatized plane. Cabin temps were extremely low even though multiple passengers were complaining. The on-board entertainment system had to be rebooted. The choice of inflight entertainment is limited and obsolete.

Staff – friendly
Staff is friendly. They have very limited options to make up for mistakes but do it with a smile.",negative

Meals were plentiful and tasty, maybe some other sirlines could learn from SQ. Good range of music and didn't bother looking for a movie. Power and computer acces and wifi available for a fee.

The Perth to Singapore flight was a delight with friendly helpful staff. The 55 minute layover in Singapore was always going to be risky as we needed to get to another terminal by train. We made it reasonably comfortably but unfortunately out suitcases didn’t. We were met at the luggage carousel in Milan by a very helpful man who helped us find where to go and also assisted in getting the claim paperwork done. The airline compensated us in cash which was very welcome as we needed clothes. They successfully had our suitcases delivered to our hotel in Venice the following day. It’s funny how, in most cases I would have been upset, but their terrific staff were a pleasure to deal with and we are left with only positive memories of Singapore Airlines.",positive

The hygiene is so bad I was bitten by flees on all my legs. When I complained and asked for proof the plane was cleaned properly before I boarded they refused to give to me and I’ve had nothing but awful conversation and lies from the representatives. If you’re going to lie about how often your plane is cleaned at least be able to back it up. Honestly etihad was so much better and there staff were just so kind.

Kudos to the team! Will definitely take more SQ flights, if it is in the given options.

TIP: If you are visiting YUNAN, CHINA --- As a travel blogger, I am very keen on getting that experiential adventure of a place.

Our preferences lodged, we relaxed only to find our preferences had been ignored and we were placed in the middle two seats of the centre row! Service was spasmodic and the row of seats in front immediately reclined their seats upon take off, even before meals were served. As a Velocity frequent flier, we were not treated well and I am now reluctant to fly Singapore airlines again.

Foot space was ample and the food was good. The 10.5 hour flight was tolerable under these spacious conditions so sleep was possible. The service was good and the flight attendants were attentive and caring.

Very comfy seat with touch screen panel for reclining seats which is great compared with he Airbus business class seat which needed crew to set up bed, a great hassle. There was a storage compartment to the right of the seat where the noise cancelling headphones and in-flight menu were kept, and a pull out mirror. On the left side of the seat, there were a few buttons to turn on/off the lights. At the front of the seat at the bottom, there were 2 compartments. I could stretch out my legs and rest my feet on them. 

I ordered food via book the cook and had grilled soya beef Jap style. Not bad. 

All in all, I didn't feel like I was on a plane. The take off/ landing was so smooth and the seat so comfortable. The 6-hour flight felt shorter as I occupied myself with movies and music.

Of course I have to mention the great service provided by the air stewardess.

2436,"Very cramped with 'average' service Da Wandering Wabbits' flight from Auckland (NZ) - Changi (Singapore) was aboard a Singapore Airlines 777-300 aircraft (9V-SWP). It was our first flight with this airline.  

Admittedly, Mr Wabbit is 6ft 8"", so most planes are tight for me...but this nearly-12-yr-old jet was the most cramped flight I've experienced in 40 years of global travel. I was twisted in my seat to angle my legs to one side, while my knees were up to the level of the tray. It was the longest 10.5 hours of my life, and my lower back was in pain for several days afterwards. Even 5ft 7"" Mrs Wabbit felt squeezed!  
At Check-in, I had asked for some consideration due to my height. Without any engagement, I was told all seats had been allocated. When I boarded and realised my predicament, I noticed some empty seats...as well as ""normal""-length passengers in the ""extra leg room seats"". But no crew members would allow me to move...even though most of them banged my knees each time they breezed out of the galley area.  
Reviewing the seat configuration post-flight, I saw the plane had only six seats marked as ""extra room"". If Singapore Air wants Western passengers, its seating needs to reflect this. Those ""extra room"" seats should be held until the last minute, for people who really need them, and the leg space in ALL seats should be increased!
 
Singapore Airlines has been lauded for years as having great service, so da Wabbits expected something very good indeed. I did not expect my size plight to be ignored by all crew. Perhaps...PERHAPS...it was because they always seemed to be rushing hither and yon...perhaps...not... The hot face towels were refreshing, but not a unique difference these days. Food was very nice and well-proportioned, with an Asian spin to the menu; refreshments flowed freely. Screen entertainment was somewhat restricted for Western eyes, but plenty for Asian palates.  

As da Wabbits exited the plane, all of the crew without exception laughed and commented on my height - I'm glad to have brought some humour to their day, however I wasn't smiling at all after that flight! 

Da Wandering Wabbits' over-all assessment: average service (not world-beating at all) with very cramped seating. I doubt we will fly Singapore Airlines again...",negative

However, the dedicated Business Class lounges in Perth and Singapore are really third-rate and let down what would otherwise be an excellent experience.  SA uses the Swiss Air lounge in Zurich which was pleasant.  Considering passengers can spend hours in the lounges I think SA could lift its' game in this area.

The service has changed quite a bit since the last time I flew with Singapore.  No amenity pack on your chair with your pillow and blanket, no printed menu, no snacks throughout the flight, limited water, is a shame as it is the little touches that give an airline the edge over others.  That said Singapore is still the best value for the route I was taking.  As we all know flying economy is not the most comfortable but the seats on the plane were pretty comfy and have a good incline when sleeping. I bought a foot hammock for the flight to Singapore and I have to say an absolute game changer, well worth taking next time you do long haul. The staff on the plane where friendly and helpful on all four of my flights and the food that I did have was good.  I had a 50 minute turn around in Singapore to and from Bali and whilst that does not sound a lot it is plenty of time.

It was an older version of the 777 with the entertainment unit in the armrest and the seats seemed narrower. We are of a certain girth and the seats were too narrow for comfort. Also, the aisle seat (40H) had a box under the seat ahead meaning there was very limited legroom. The cabin crew were pleasant enough as was the food, but our row had an inexperienced team and we waited with our trays after the meal service for about an hour..

But normally ONLY with Singapore Airlines, most friendly crew of any airline, Singapore terminals fantastic (and the food court).
Usually June to end August, return from Jhb to KL, but transfer in Singapore.
Usually drive back down for a few days from KL, Holiday Inn Atrium fantastic hotel close to shops, bars and Orchard Road.",positive
7292,"Smooth experience, as usual. My wife and I were travelling to Sri Lanka but had a Sri Lankan airlines ticket from Singapore to Colombo. We had return tickets from Sydney to Singapore with Singapore airlines. Since Sri Lankan airlines and Singapore airlines don't do code share and are in different alliances, I didn't even bother asking the check in agent if our baggage can be interlined all the way to Colombo. However, he asked what our destination is and when we explained our situation, checked with his supervisor and checked in our baggage all they way to Colombo voluntarily. Talk about customer service! Bravo!
The SYD->SIN cabin service was a little below their usual standards. The flight attendants seem to be a bit impatient. I think that they were doing back to back shifts, overworked and tired. If anyone from the management is reading this, it's flight SQ242 on 24th Dec. 
In flight entertainment, meals and leg space in economy were among the best (as usual). 
Cheers!",positive
2084,"Service great, food dismal Premium economy was ok-ish but still think BA is better. 
DON’T bother with the ‘Book the Cook’ option. The food was dreadful. I’m not that fussy, especially when bored on a long trip, but two of the meals were truly inedible. Congealed tasteless chicken sitting on top of a mound of overcooked fused rice. 
A soggy lump of what was laughingly described as a buckwheat pancake flopping over the edge of the dish. Plastic cups of wine - one leg the wine was finally delivered after I had finished my cardboard dinner in spite of several requests. And please forget the ‘vegetarian sandwich’ -a soggy lump of bread with a little grated carrot hiding in its centre.
Pretty shameful for the price or
take a Tupperware of your own food as one of my neighbours had sensibly packed in her luggage.",neutral

Wake up and breakfast is served, more movies to watch, and you are there before you know it.",positive
4899,"Rightfully one of the best airlines Traveling with family on the SQ airbus 380 is an experience by itself.the seats are old and sleeping is somewhat uncomfortable but the service was a class in itself. The staff were excellent, food was fresh ,the wines were excellent and most importantly the jet lag was minimal if at all.they could do better with their amenities and no sleepwear was provided which prompted us to use other airline sleepwear.these minor differences is what makes their competitors an edge better.
I would travel on SingaporeAir again.",positive

Won't fly with them again on a long flight. Air conditioning was very noisy.,neutral

4663,"Exceeding expectations After a stressful period it was time for some vacation. Rocking up at the airport eager to get on my way I found, much to my embarrassment, that I was a day too early. More as a joke than anything else, I asked if they couldn't change me to the flight that was about to leave instead of coming back again the day after. To my surprise the woman at the checkin referred me on to the service desk where they actually re-booked my flight, at no extra cost. Resulting in me getting to enjoy a day in Singapore before continuing my journey. On top of that they gave me a seat with extra legroom which I, being 2m tall, greatly appreciated.

In short, they went beyond what I could expect and accommodated me in a fantastic way. The rest of my trip with them was also very good, with great service and friendly crew.",positive
9962,"Also the best airline of the world can have mechanical problems... Flight SQ 972, seat 50 H.June 27th, 2018.
Flight delayed by one hour, then flight delayed and delayed. Mechanical problems. Ingeneers working on it. 
After a couple of hours: stewards litterally ran with boxes of snacks and drinks. The Singapore Airlines responsable made an announcement: safety is and will always be our first duty.
Then we all were sent to the second floor for a meal...Yum, yum...
Finally another plane came to bring us to BKK, we had to change gate. All under the supervision of Sing.Airlines staff.  Big surprise: all passengers were given a leather wallet (empty, huhu) with the logo of the airline. I will cherish the wallet for the rest of my life.
When the plane took off, the first thing we had to do was eat again.

The service was very impressive as were the meals and the entire crew.

The economy seats are quite comfortable with good leg room and the entertainment selection on Krisworld was again excellent.

If flying the SQ A350 I would avoid the forward economy section. While the smaller cabin may sound appealing you are also close to row 41 with the baby cots. On an overnight flight it’s not pleasant with constantly crying babies. 

I highly recommend Singapore airlines and would certainly fly them again if they fly to my destination.",positive

1967,"great staff We recently flew from London to NZ and back. Over all it was a good service with attentive staff who did their best to make 14 hour flights bearable. It was quite funny that we had to walk through business class (here is what you could have had) to get to the economy seats. One point we would like to make is the amount of packaging and plastic on the food trays. Maybe there is a way to reduce the waste. Also when we had all dropped off to sleep the crew gave out packets of nuts in very shiny and noisy packets to the few who were still awake, guaranteed to wake us up as people attempted to open them.  Great selection of movies available. Very impressed that the toilets were kept clean throughout the flight.",positive

1027,"It's been worth the long wait I'm surely not the only one who's had to put travel on hiatus due to the ongoing pandemic but it's a good feeling knowing that it's finally more practical to travel again.  Taking a short trip to Bangkok to begin with, the feeling of finally getting back on a plane was refreshing.  Check-in and luggage submission for this mid-morning flight was fairly easy with lots of ground staff around to provide assistance.  I also got to board in an earlier group which was useful for getting settled into my window seat.  As usual, the Krisflyer system was superb with hours and hours of movies, TV shows, music and games to keep any traveller entertained,  Singapore Airlines has changed the way their meals are presented - the new boxes (as opposed to trays) is a nice change and is likely to also help keep the heat in longer.  I've rarely enjoyed the airline's economy class breakfasts but the century egg congree I had was wonderful - hot, tasty, and more satisfying than the noodles or omelette that's usually offered.  We also had the benefit of a clear day that made views out the window interesting.  Here's to more flying in the coming months ahead!",positive
2443,"Outstanding Without  a doubt, an exceptional airline. The service is outstanding as is the choice of food, all served with such grace and charm.The aircraft are so new and modern and very comfortable (A350) lots of leg room and an amazing in flight entertainment programme. 
The cabin crew are without a doubt the most polite and helpful one could meet anywhere, nothing is too much trouble, and they are all so elegant and smart, it gives a real feeling of travelling with someone special who cares about the passenger. All in all an excellent flight (as was the return) so if ever I need to go to Houston again it'll be with Singapore Airlines from Manchester which also avoids that awful place called Heathrow.",positive
8485,"Singapore Style  We have flown with Singapore Airlines a few times before on this flight but in recent years we had chosen to use a couple of low cost carriers to ‘save’ money. When planning this trip we compared all the add ons needed on the cheap airlines (bags, food and seats) and found that the costs were not too different for the way we travel. 

It was a joy to return to Singapore Airlines, with their attentive and top notch service. On check in I found myself with a window seat but preference for an aisle. It was no problem for the staff to see if my request could be accommodated, which it was. 

I will definitely rebook with Singapore due to the great service.",positive

Can't say the same for the Singapore Staff, stood around waiting at the arrival gate, finally got a golf buggy to the train, no wheelchair or staff to assist. Had to get ourselves through security. Despite paying over AU$1,030 for an upgrade to Premium economy and boarding pass being stickered for wheelchair support still had to line up and hobble to the plane, staff were rude and told us to sit down and wait.
Paris staff were excellent, wheelchaired us all the way through the airport to the taxi rank. Shame Changi Staff, Being a Kris Flyer obviously doesn't count for anything either.",positive

Much better than 1st class on SIA!!",negative
9267,Upgrade not worth it Received  an upgrade from economy to premium economy. While we had a little more leg room we were disappointed with service and food.

1058,"Business Class should allow for bigger people Just travelled Business Class on Singapore Airlines (Bne –Sing- Bkk return, out early March, back late April), sorry NOT good.  The hype about Singapore Airlines Business class is a lie. The worst business class service I have ever experience. SQ 246 / 235 & SQ 709 / 706 on A350-900 aircraft.  On 3 of the fights I had the nasty small business class seats and only 1 flight the bigger long haul seat, which is what all business class seat should be like.  All the seats are poorly designed. So frustrating as small changes could make a huge difference.  On the small nasty seats you cannot stretch your legs out straight (must be angled) and on all flights everything (controls and the like) are behind you, very difficult to reach. I am big guy (fat) which is why I pay 4 times the cost of economy, to get more room (and bitter service).  None of the tray tables had adjustment, so I could not use them or had to force it into my stomach for my premium economy quality meal service. They used a drink cart like in economy !  No hot / cold towel or drink prefight.  I was not greeted by name. No lay flat seat, no night turn down service. All very ordinary.  Out bound (Bne-Sing-Bkk) 3/10 rating.  Now 7 weeks later I had many of the same issues, but was lucky enough to get seats near the galley i.e. no seat Infront of me so the arrangement was different.   The long haul plane (Bkk-Sing 2.5 hours) had a much wider seat that was nice but the same stupid issue with the tray table that folds out from the armrest and no slide adjustment, I ended up putting the meal on the foot rest/shelf in front and holding the dishes as I ate. At least in this seat I did not need a belt extension. On the next flight (Sing- Bne, 6.5 hours) back to the nasty small seats and the tray table pulled out from the cabinet in front and not out from the arm rest as the other 3 flights were configured and although I could not extend it into its locked position I could at least eat from it.  However, to give Sing Air due credit, the service and food was much improved. Home bound (Bkk-Sing) 3/10 rating, (Sing-Bne) 6/10.

5636,Wow. Amazing Experience and Staff First time flying with Singapore and will again given the chance. Business class as good or better than most long haul first class products.

I think every flight attendant and officer from the plane stopped by to wish me well. Amazing and unexpected. Kudos!,positive

From the moment we were checked in by cheery and helpful (and laughing) staff, we felt comfortable. The Sydney lounge was excellent and we boarded on time. The new seats are bigger than those I have flown in 1st Class on Thai Airways. The seats converted to full beds and were most comfortable. The staff were amazing, satisfying our individual requests with charm and enthusiasm. We arrived in Singapore on time (a two hour stopover) and departed on time. There were plenty of seats in the Business Lounge and the food was delightful. Once again we took off on time and landed in Frankfurt on time. Different crew but equally pleasant and always smiling.

Used to get breakfast pre pandemic with this flight. Not any more.  SQ needs to realise the last memory of the flight is starving passengers who have to nick to Maccas on landing.  Not good enough. Not for a flight that cost thousands.  SQ was in the red now is in the black so it is time to bring back the service that SQ was famous for.  I think everyone on my flight was as bitterly disappointed as I was. I guess they are No 1 in first class, and have given up even trying to compete with business.  Maybe it is time to move on.

8662,"A good experience, everything smooth, but at the price so it should have been My wife and I flew to Singapore in September. It was a special occasion and we treated ourselves to Business class. Expensive, but as is it a 13 hour flight, we decided it was worth it. The plus bits. Both flights were morning take off, so it meant we could forego breakfast before leaving for the airport and eat in the business lounges, and at both airports the buffet breakfast were OK. The lounge at Singapore definitely the better of the two, but no real complaints about either.
Check-in, boarding, welcome aboard all fine. Stewards on the flight were attentive and friendlly. Food and refreshments were good and nicely distributed over the flight. As we were in Business class we had the seat/ bed cubicles, which I have to say are a real treat.
There is also Wi-Fi on the plane, which is free in a Business. Be wary though of getting caught with Data roaming charges from mobile data as your devices may not be in Airplane mode, 

The annoying bits, which are not so much The airlines fault as annoyances with the seats/cubicles. First it is almost impossible to have a conversation with the person next to you. If you are travelling alone, you may consider that a real bonus. If you are travelling with someone, may be less so.
The cubicles also make it difficult to walk around on the flight. There is less need as the cubicles are very comfortable, at least for someone of my average size, but you cannot easily just walk around the plane.
Finally, Singapore Airline’s web site is not the best. It is slow and not very reliable.

Seats are spacious, comfortable and with much privacy.  There is free Wi-Fi access.  The entertainment system is great because of the good screen and sound quality, as well as the wide selection of shows and movies.  Flight attendants are very friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Dinner is average.",positive
8767,Great service and product Good service. Friendly crew. Delicious food. Great hard product. These are my expectations when it comes to SQ.  And my expectations were met on this flight.,positive
686,"Not value for money This review covers four business class flights with SIA and they don't come close to either Etihad or Emirates. The lounge at Heathrow has a great view with floor to ceiling windows, or it would have if they were clean. Obviously there'd been children wiping their hands and faces all over the glass, a little off putting to put it mildly, and the lounge itself was very busy. The food was awful, I've had better breakfasts at Wetherspoons!
The flight to Singapore was ok apart from the seat configuration meaning that if the seat was in lie flat mode you had to lie at an angle with only a small recess to put your feet. The inflight entertainment offered a very poor selection right across the board, very little on there to interest me which is something I've not encountered on any other airline.
The positives were the food and the crew, both very good.
Flying from Changi on different flight, the lounge was packed and had hardly any western food, not great when my only real choice was crisps. The flight to Adelaide was ok but, given that it was a night flight, it was obvious that the crew just wanted to get us fed and turn the lights down as quickly as possible, a real dip in service there.
Our flight from Cairns to Singapore was a beauty, upon check in we were told there was no Business Class lounge and we were given a voucher each for twenty Australian dollars as compensation. Some compensation this was as it wasn't even enough to cover a drink and a sandwich but surely it would get better on the flight? No, the starter advertised as smoked duck somehow morphed into smoked salmon, ah well, they both live in water so I suppose that was near enough. My wife asked for a glass of Shiraz as advertised in the in flight menu, none available so she settles for the Chianti. Upon asking for a refill we were told they'd run out so it was on to whatever they could find! The choice of five deserts shrank to just ice cream or cheese and biscuits but by this stage we were no longer surprised although when they told us that they didn't have any brandy we were really taken aback. It should be noted that there was only ten business class seats on this flight and they couldn't even service that small number efficiently, not a criticism on the crew, just shocking planning.
Our flight back to Heathrow was again marred by the seat configuration, when you've paid such a premium for business class only to find that you can't get comfortable on a fourteen hour flight is simply not acceptable.
In my opinion, SIA are now a long way behind their competitors and, reading other reviews, it seems they don't care. I have communicated my thoughts to their customer service but I'm not holding my breath waiting for any response or resolution. There are alternatives to this airline and I would suggest that people should explore them",negative
5890,"Worst Eco ever flown Only One Drink for dinner and breakfast. Did Not pay attention to guest on seat number A, only B and C. Never had such a Bad experience on Board in economy class. After departing ZRH, inflight entertainment after a commercial break (never had a commercial break during a Film, only at singapore airlines) Shows only audio-screen was black until departure in singapore-nobody could help me, so i entertained me by myself. Reaktion time from customers Service center:more than 3, up to 4 weeks. Sorry, But this is neither a 5 Star Airline nor the Worlds best Airline. This Was my worst economy flight ever!! Never again, singapore airlines.",negative
6069,"Broken pram and terrible customer service! Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. 

We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. 
This was all arranged with no problems. 
However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I’m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said “sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her” she said “you can’t use these toilets you have to go back” I explained the queue situation but she wouldn’t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. 
When we arrived at Perth airport we were extremely annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was basically hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts.
They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it’s the only pram we have and we couldn’t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. 
We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would NEVER fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience.",negative
7617,"Good hospitality and food I took SQ a year ago and not much has changed. The seats have been reupholstered, the cabin has been redecorated, but besides that, it's fundamentally the same.

Flight was slightly delayed (1h) but crew were apologetic so all's good. As always, I enjoyed the warm hospitality by the flight crew. I had a problem with my audio but one flight attendant gladly helped me rectify it by resetting the in-flight entertainment system (more on that later).

Seats were fairly comfortable; decent legroom for me (a 170cm tall lad).

Meals took quite a while to be served after we had reached cruising altitude, though. Could see crew pushing trolleys up and down the aisle but never served us until around 20-30 min after children were served.

The wait was worth it though. The pan-seared chicken was first-class even though I was in Economy class. So juicy and tender and delectable - made me feel as if I was on the ground and not eating a pre-catered flight meal. Top-notch.

However, the IFE left much to be desired. Very dated with the screens on some planes being so pixelated. At least you can find the latest movies and music albums there.

Overall, an average journey; the best part about it is the hospitality. Cheerios, keep it up!",positive
7271,"Worthwhile Premium economy was a nice upgrade from Economy class, but I must admit that I had expected a bit more. This probably had to do with the fact that SIA economy class is already a great way to travel, even longhaul! 
Priority check-in and boarding is quick and easy. 
The seats are comfortable and spacious. The book the cook option is nice but not necessarily a must. I loved the noise cancelling earphones provided by SIA, but other than that there’s not much difference compared to economy.
You will need to make your way down the isle through economy to use the toilet facilities. 
I would’ve liked to have had the option for bubbles before departure (a few years ago they even offered that in economy class...) and the toiletries weren’t different either.",positive
5503,"World Class Airline!!! This was my first trip with singapore airlines but for long flights in the future i would always prefer to fly with Singapore airlines.

Service, flight attendants, food, drinks, entertainment, cleaniness, and check in are absolutely outstanding.

Other airlines should learn from Singapore airlines as a role model airline.",positive
9945,"Great overall package Negotiating Changi Airport is not one of my favourite things to do.  However, it does seem to get easier as one becomes more familiar with the layout.  From landing to getting into the next departure area is on average a 45 minute hike.  As is always the case with Singapore Airlines, service and standards are excellent.  The business lounge could not be faulted for variety of food and quality.  The flight was excellent, service exceptional - nice to have staff who listen - and the flight crew should be congratulated on the landing.  From touchdown to engines stopped at the bay in Melbourne precisely 5 minutes.  I understand it depends on a lot of factors, being ex-aircrew myself, but this was truly exceptional and did not involve massive amounts of reverse thrust either.  Well done all round!",positive
7432,"Premium service even in economy From check-in to boarding, everything was stress free because of the pleasant and very efficicient Singapore Aurlines staff. Upon boarding our aircraft, nothing changed. Staff welcomed us with a smile and ensured all,our comfort needs were attended. We didn’t have to ask for service - they pre-empted our needs. We received regular food and drink service and when they knew our liking of a Singapore Sling, another was offered without us asking. The meals were the best quality we have experienced on all airlines we have used. We will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.",positive

Will definitely fly again!",positive
5684,"Business Class to Christchurch was substandard From Bangalore, we got a SilkAir flight, which was average. Their iPad entertainment system was novel for me and very good. From Singapore we got onto a Singapore Airlines Airbus 350, i think. The business class was definitely substandard.  Given SQ's reputation, this was extremely unacceptable. In fact, we paid 25% more in fares over Malaysian just because of the SQ image. The seat was the most pathetic business class seat I have experienced since flat beds came into vogue, about 20 years ago.
While seated you couldn't stretch your legs out as there was not enough place in front of you...And I am just  5 ft 8 in tall. Neither could you lie flat on the fully flat bed.!!! The only way , one could stretch out one's legs , when seated or lying down, is if one stretched it out diagonally; at an angle. A most uncomfortable position, leading to muscle catches and aches on getting up. And in the prone position the seat belt came tight under your armpit and buckled in bElow your waist...a very, very uncomfortable and terribly restricted experience.
Having flown Business, on Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and British,this was not even comparable.
I can tell you that I NEVER WANT TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE AGAIN. In fact, I think Singapore Airlines, should refund the premium they charged on the grounds that they were giving me and my wife , privileged business class seats!! The seats were actually a punishment.
I am flying back from Sydney on 16th MAY, business Class on an A 380 aircraft. I sincerely hope that will be a better experience",negative

3641,Disappointing Premium Economy This was the last of 4 flights with Singapore Airlines done over a 7 week period all in Premium Economy. The flight was satisfactory but I don’t think I would fly this category with this airline again - not really worth the extra money. You do have a cabin section for only Premium Economy travelers but no assigned toilet - you need to use the toilet available in the Economy section and there are often queues. I have traveled another airline in Premium Economy and the toilets were located in the PE cabin area. The good aspect is that you do have comfortable large seats and extra leg room and plenty of overhead baggage space. The meals are ok but are just the same as Economy - you are served before the rest of the Economy section. We were offered champagne on takeoffs with Singapore but I think this is a standard process in all PE cabins. We were comfortable in our seats but I think future flights with Singapore would just be in Economy class. At checkin there is a dedicated Premium Economy counter which is great - no queues and you are able to board the plane before Economy travelers- again great but you do need to print your own baggage tags and boarding passes as has been adopted by most airlines. Bring back the option of having a staff member check you in and print your relevant documents and see to your baggage.,neutral
1373,"Is Premium Economy value for money? I chose SQ premium economy as it gives me the priority boarding, extra baggage allowance, slightly spacious seats, and more food options.  Often I was asked if premium economy is worth the money? I would say SQ offer a good product and I'm willing to pay extra in exchange of better seat.",positive
8846,"Excellent service - even if it was in economy! We recently flew from Sydney to Singapore on our way to Cambodia in economy.  The flight stewards were excellent.

The meals were also of a very high standard - hot and flavoursome. Very much appreciated.",positive
1400,"Not a pleasant flight. My wife and I had just got off a pretty unpleasant Silk Air transfer from Cairns and were looking forward to a huge improvement in service, food and entertainment similar to the service we'd enjoyed on the way out to Australia. What a disappointment. Having worked in air engineering for a few decades I was surprised at the condition of the B777 we flew home in. It was dirty, both our seats wouldn't return to the upright without pushing them up manually and both our meal trays were broken. As the aircraft powered up and made it's way down the runway I seriously thought it would fall to bits. The internal cabin furniture was shaking around very badly. The crew weren't particularly friendly and we both got missed continuously for refreshment. They ran out of some food and had to make up a breakfast for my wife. I should have taken down the aircraft's MSN.",neutral

4222,New A380 Business Class Excellent flight on the new A380 Business Class fit-out.  Plenty of space for personal items and cabin bags can be stored under the seat in front instead of overhead lockers (which are available if needed).  Seat is firm but comfortable and deploying the bed is simple.  I had quite a few hours' sleep which is rare for me on a flight.  No problems with sleeping position - some people think they won't like the angle - but there is ample space to stretch out or curl up.  Singapore Airlines service and meals are always excellent and attendants always very obliging.,positive

575,"Average Service and simple meals offered I have flown with SIN air 30 years ago and their flights were great services and good food. After that I didn't have a chance to fly with SIN for several reasons and this year I decided to fly with SIN again and boy it was so disappointed with their services and meals that they provided during the trip from SGN-SIN and SIN-LAX.
The flight attendances were so cold and not friendly, their choices for drink were limited only coke, Sprite for soda, water, Orange and apple juices, Lipton tea and coffee. I asked for soda with ice and they said they don't have it until later but later never came. Their drinks weren't cold.
The meals were so basic with bread, butter, 1 simple dessert and plain main course while other airlines offered extra like salad, fruits and more choices for main course.
The only thing it was good that they were pretty much on time on both legs
The seats for my first leg were Premium Economy so I have no complain, the seats for  2nd leg I got an empty seat in between so I didn't feel the pain of small seat for 15+ hour flight time
Entertainment selections were not the latest and not whole lot of choices
If I have a choice to chose airline in the future compare for pricing, time and services, I wouldn't go with SIN airline if the price is not much cheaper than other airlines",negative

7225,"A little disappointing This flight was overall pretty good. I like flying with Singapore Airlines.  I have to say there were a couple of disappointments.  The food was the biggest. I was really surprised at the meal.  The presentation was as always top notch, but I found the food bland, did not enjoy the dessert either.  I also find it peculiar that SQ does not give business class passengers an amenity kit.  On this flight we got a leather pouch with fabric treatment and hand sanitizer. This is not what I expected.  The seats are great when upright, wide and comfortable.  When set up for bed, if you are a tall person, you have to sleep in a position that is askew. I was in seat 19 A which apparently has a little more room as there is no seat in front of me.
Service on the flight is of course top notch.  
Overall the flight was good, we left on time and got to Singapore ahead of schedule. I used to think of Singapore Airlines as the best business class in the Star Alliance, but I think that title now goes to EVA Air. The difference is the food, including the fact that EVA Air gives you a mid-flight meal great cheese burger available on demand. EVA also gives pajamas to business class",positive

Next time I’ll choose a flight which provides this.",positive
1017,"Terrible travel experience My first time flying with Singapore Airlines and it was by far the worst experience I've had with any airline. 

When I first tried to book the ticket, I got all the way to payment, only to get an error message saying they couldn't process the request and to please start over with the booking. When I started over, the price suddenly increased by over $500. Seemed like a classic bait and switch. That should have been my first clue to look elsewhere, but unfortunately I decided to go ahead with the booking at the new increased price.

For a 16 hour flight from San Francisco to Singapore, there was no toiletry kit provided. I've flown many premium economy and business class flights and toiletry kits have always been provided (plus slippers), but apparently Singapore Airlines offers nothing of this kind. I've become so used to having the toiletry kits provided that I no longer pack a toothbrush and toothpaste in my carry-on. So, for this flight I was out of luck with no way to brush my teeth. 

The flight left around 10 pm pacific time, and dinner was served about an hour later. Dinner service was alright, though unusually slow compared to what I've experienced with other airlines. And the food was pretty good. But then nothing else except water was offered until almost 11 am pacific time the next day. So almost 12 hours with only water offered and no food at all. Despite the late dinner, I was starving by the time they finally got around to serving breakfast. I really cannot understand how they expect passengers to go 12 hours without at least a small snack being offered, especially when they are serving breakfast closer to lunch time relative to the departure time zone. 

When I originally booked the ticket, there was prominent language saying that you could change the booking without any additional fee. I did need to change the booking, but conveniently they claimed they didn't have tickets in my class on the date I wanted to change to. I can understand how tickets might not be available on a particular day, but they couldn't even offer a ticket within 5 days of my desired date. I suspect they had availability, but were just up-selling me. The best they could do was to ""upgrade"" my premium economy ticket to a ""flexi"" premium economy ticket for $900 more. It would still just be a premium economy seat, so the ""flexi"" option didn't really provide much added benefit. So, in effect, they wanted to charge me an additional $900 just to change the booking. 

Although I wasn't happy about it, I decided to go ahead with the upgrade and change the flight date. The agent explained that they would have to confirm the booking and call me back to arrange the additional payment. It took the agent a while to call back, so I went to SA's website to check the booking myself. The booking had been changed, but I was downgraded to regular economy, and on top of that had more than a 20 hour layover in Singapore added into the itinerary (original booking only had a few hours layover). So, on top of the $900 additional charge, I was now apparently downgraded to regular economy, plus now needed to get a hotel in Singapore for the layover. Oh, and when they finally did call me back about the booking, they hung up on me immediately and I never heard from them again.

I'm sure I could have straightened out the mess with the new booking, but at this point I'd had enough. I just booked another premium economy ticket with another airline and canceled the flight with SA. 

The final insult from Singapore Airlines is that they're only refunding about $300 of a $2500 round trip ticket. So I'm canceling half the flight, but getting much less than a fifth of my money back. But even with the pathetic refund amount, I think I actually saved a little bit by booking with another airline. SA is very expensive, but you apparently don't get upgraded service for the extra money. An absolutely terrible experience, I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.",negative

4147,World No.1 Airline I hadn't flown with Singapore Airlines for some years but I was very impressed from boarding the aircraft to reluctantly explaining meals etc  leaving the flight in Singapore.The cabin crew were always on hand to assist if needed.I also was fortunate to have a Seabass  for lunch and it has to be the best fish meal I have had in many long year in flight or on the ground. It was delicate very moist and beautifully cooked and presented as you would encounter in a fine dining restaurant. We were blow away by this meal,positive
1287,They have had my money since August 15 2019 and wont return it !!!! Singapore Airlines have been absolutely horrible with communicating and dealing with customers over the refund of money for flights during COVID 19 . We are still waiting for money we paid in August 2019 and are sent emails saying they have paid us and that the money will take 12-16 weeks to clear through the bank .The customer service people are just saying we are sorry but we are dealing with returning monies but nothing ever happens .Then they send an email saying they have sent the money and nothing comes . Its a nightmare and I will never travel with them again .Our flights were early June and its now mid October . they have had our money for 16 months !!!!!!,negative
4628,"tiny seats noisy plane inedible food every time you leave aust. you have to fly the only direct flight from adel. to singapore is with SIA. Knowing this the plane is full most of the time & so the service, food,seating is not very good.

7290,Flight of a lifetime My wife and I flew to Singapore in October 2018 .From the second we boarded the new a 380 we were waited on hand and foot by the ever smiling staff . I cannot really put into words how it felt but I would recommend to any one if they are going to try this airline they will not be disappointed . The legroom was amazing and the seats were very comfortable .. The aircrew were always there to see to our every need . Thank you Singapore Airlines,positive

3924,"Great Airline and great Airport. First leg of travel from Adelaide to Singapore in the new plane is not as good as the previous plane as we liked the 2-4-2 seats better, and it seems a little less leg room but the service is great and Changi Airport is fantastic to wait for the connection flight. 
If you are flying back Singapore Airlines don’t forget to claim S$40 voucher either. on the way out or on the way back Upon presentation of your boarding passes and passports. We claimed it on the way into Singapore but will spend the voucher on the way back.",positive

8514,"Lived up to expectation We were looking forward to our long flight to Singapore having decided against BA and opting for the more expensive airline based on their reputation.  Singapore Airlines did not disappoint and every part of the service from choosing the flight, checking in and disembarking was carried out smoothly, on time and with a genuine smile.  The quality of food, drinks and choice available via the entertainment system was amazing.  We had told the airline in advance that it was my wife's birthday the day we flew out and they made the flight extra special with a couple of glasses of fizz, a lovely cake, gifts and a handwritten note from the crew. Our experience supported why they are the award winning number 1 airline.",positive
8218,"Use of tired old plans to Perth We were returning from  Zurich and took the connecting flight from Singapore to Perth. We were supposed to travel on a 777 but instead they used an old Airbus which was very tired, and had grubby and frayed seats. SIA need to lift their game if they are concerned about their image and either clean up their old Airbuses, or decommission them! It’s not as if we were given a cheap fare deal as we paid a high price for 2 return tickets from Perth to Europe. 

The customer service onboard is always good but the crew on the day took a very long time to get organised before we eventually got our meals, due to a mixup over the special meals they had to serve first to other  passengers. What a shambles!!
The meals were not their usual standard on this flight.

I am now considering other airlines for our next overseas flight.",neutral

8454,The flight Check in was very quick.  I had an aisle seat in the middle row which was very comfortable and easy when I wanted to get up.  The attendants were very pleasant and helpful.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  It was quick to get through customs and didn't have to wait long for baggage.,positive
6484,"Good long flight I flew on A350 aircraft operated by Singapore Airlines. It was somewhat older plane. This is very long flight over 16 hours. Service on plane is good, and I do not have any complaints on staff. Food was good but not the best. I had better experiences with other airlines in regards to food. I was surprised that toilet kit was not offered in business class (other airlines offer this).
In regards to plane seat was comfortable but not fully automatic. If you wanted to put it in bed position you had to stand up and use latch to bring it down. In laying position you have to go diagonally since opening for legs is on side(strange configuration).
But over all flight is ok and no complaints. I did have better experiences with other companies.",positive

1613,"Comfortable but Nothing Special We went Premium as it was a long haul. Having heard so much about this airline we were both, I am afraid to say just a little disappointed. Perhaps we were expecting too much.

I really don't think this class was worth the extra we paid over economy. To be brutally honest and to make a sort of comparison,  the Emirates  economy Dubai/London flight on the Airbus A380 has always been a better experience. 

All I can suggest is that when going long haul then do the research , especially aircraft type used.",neutral
3363,"Smooth ride, needs improvement on water served with meals It's my first time to ride this airline because I'm a budget traveler and this one happens to be one of the expensive yet known for comfort and service.  

The reason I took it because of the 16hour flight to Johannesburg compared to 22hours in other airline but the price is double.  Compared to my option airline who just had a crash that's why it's so cheap I decided to take Singapore Airline.  I immediately felt like the plane is not overused compared to other airlines that I'm used to taking.

When food was served, I ate and drank the water that came with the food (not the one served). It tasted like tap water or worse than that I thought it might be the food I ate but I tried it again and informed the crew and sent a complain letter (they were apologetic, no I didn't get anything) just to be sure I also sent a letter to Singapore airline because that water came from turkey and it may have traveled far or whatever it just tasted bad and very bad for their brand.  I'd still travel using Singapore airline because their business is primarily taking people to their destination and food is just part of this service.",neutral
6319,"Technical difficulties on a A-380 Flight should have departed at 21.45 and we boarded at 9 pm and sat on the tarmac with a computer related problem until 3 am.  Finally the captain decided to deplane the passengers who were really hungry by then.  We had been offered water and a small packet of peas after 2 hours and a packet of potato chips after 4 hours, but no substantial food of any kind.

I’ve been in this situation before and usually a round of drinks is offered after a couple of hours delay and snacks but no such luck this time.

We then waited at the airport lounge for two hours to get taken to a hotel where we checked in at 6 am and were told to get some refreshments from the breakfast buffet (which wasn’t really open until 6.30).  By the time our luggage was in and we could hit the sack it was 7 am and we were told to be downstairs ready to go back to the airport at 11 am.  That meant a maximum of 4 hours sleep!  As it turned out we had 3 hours, then gathered at the lobby at 10.45 only to be told we would be picked up at 1.30 after lunch!

Coordination was not good.  Refreshments on board could have been served much quicker.  It took ages to sort out transportation to the hotel and then we were misinformed about onward arrangements.  Eventually the flight was scheduled to leave 20 hours later at 5.30 but was further delayed an hour to 6.30 pm, so why we needed to be up and ready at 11 am was unclear.  

Once onboard things were smoother and although many had missed their connecting flights, we were taken care of much more efficiently in Singapore airport:  we were met with hotel vouchers, and allowed to take individual taxis to the hotel, which minimised the waiting time and reduced frustration levels. We were also given a $100 voucher to use against a flight or duty free shopping.

Not a great experience but managed fairly well overall.  Flight safety is what we need and a fresh flight ensured that !",positive
352,"Premium Economy sadly lacking Paid for Prem Econ as these were very long flights.   Had left NZ on AirNZ Pem Econ and really enjoyed the experiences.  However, Singapore Airlines Prem econ was basically economy with a larger seat.  Sadly lacking in a number of areas that Air NZ provided - separate toilets from Econ, nicer food, better service with dedicated stewards, hot towels, plenty of snacks.  Definitely wouldn't book Prem Econ with Singapore again unless they improve their offering.",neutral

The seat pitch and width were also very good and overall in terms of cost the flight was great value for money.",positive
9695,"No Sweat flight by Singapore Airlines The check-in process in Changi was DIY, and I find it more convenient than the usual. Our flight was at around 750pm bound to MNL and our boarding time was on-time. On board, the safety instructions were in AVP format that is not a typical demo of an in plane safety guidelines. It exhibited the various must-see sights in Singapore that you might want to visit.

The duration of the flight was almost 4 hours due to the bad weather condition and air traffic. We experience slight turbulence but the whole flight was smooth. You can also choose latest movies, series, music and games to pass the time. The cabin crew were accommodating and warm when I requested for extra blankets. The in-flight meals they served were delicious. We were also offered ice cream for dessert! 

It was my first time to fly via Singapore Airlines and I would definitely recommend them for those who will travel soon.",positive

We had a 5 hour stopover in Singapore on our way home and best Airport I have ever been in with loads to do.

1257,"Very poor service Flew Frankfurt to Adelaide with transit in Singapore. We are frequent flyers with another airline and were absolutely shocked at the poor service by Singapore Airlines. Our flight tickets cost $5,500 each for economy! On our first leg (12.5 hours) we were offered 1 meal within the first hour after takeoff then absolutely nothing, not even a beverage for the next 8 hours! I went down to the cabin crew to ask for food and was only offered a fun pack size chips and snack size Kitkat! We were then served an extremely small breakfast meal just before landing. Couldn’t believe the cost cutting! Four times the price and no food nor service. In the second leg (6.5 hours) we weren’t offered a single thing, not even a beverage until 1 hour before landing when we were hurriedly served a tiny breakfast. Absolute shame on Singapore Airlines taking advantage of Aussie citizens trying to return home. Stealing money and starving their passengers who are spending days travelling just to get back!",negative
2333,"Business class standard dropped  Took SQ business class from Singapore to Istanbul, it’s quite shocking that the standard has dropped significantly: 
1) the seat was not cleaned properly, and the remote control had food stains on it; 
2) the wifi that showed it’s connected didn’t work at all, the aircrews attempted to fix the problem but no success; 
3) the in-flight entertainment suddenly switched off by itself and unable to restart while I was half way watching a show; 
4) the washroom run out of tissue paper; and what made it worse was 
5) while waiting for my turn outside the lavatory, the Pilot came out and cut my queue! I understand that the crews may have priorities as they are on duty, but he was simply rude!",negative
2437,Most comfortable seats we have tried in a long time This was an economy flight with excellent service and very comfortable seats. We were able to sleep for 7 hours on a 13 hour flight which is just what we needed. It is unusual to experience such comfort and service in economy class these days. The flight attendants were very helpful and responsive to your needs; all in all this was an enjoyable experience.,positive
4380,"Great inflight Staff First time I have flown with Singapore for years actually..  The inflight staff were wonderful very attentive..  I class myself as an easy passenger nit always getting them to my seat..  The only thing is that unlike other lie flat beds you have to pull the seat manually to get the mattress down..  I couldn't do it but the staff came straight to help me..  On the next flight I actually didn't bother and just put the seat as low as it would go..  I am not a large person so was fine for me..  The food I love and you can order your food before you travel..  
On the way back from the UK I was left for ages in a holding area because I needed assistance if it was a looong walk which apparently it was..  
On my last leg to Brisbane the plane was sooo old a lot of the buttons didn't  work or got stuck..  The poor flight crew were apologising and it held them up tremendously fixing stuff that wouldn't work..  I did complain for them really and I know others did as well..
The crew made my flight..  

A word of warning..
 ## I am a Kris Flyer member but for some reason it was not on my booking so I did not get my ff points..  I did ring them but they wanted information that I had not kept even though I checked in online they could not trace it..

6872,"Economy meal in Business Class. I have had very unpleasant experience on flight from Singapore to Melbourne recently. Was expecting very high meal standards from a Singapore Airlines Business class. 
This was morning flight from Singapore. After breakfast was served, flight attendant took the order for dinner service. I was first person to be served and order taken as my seat was 11a on airbus 350-900. This was several hours before the meal which was fine. 
I have ordered chicken. When meal service started at dinner time I was told that they are out of chicken and can offer me lamb or vegetarian meal. I was surprised why I wasn’t notified earlier and especially when I was first person to be taken order. 
After that I opted for the lamb. I have obeserved that there was a several chicken meals distributed to peoples seating behind me which was strange.
When I tasted the lamb I was not satisfied with this meal as it was very tough ( chewy), had strong smell and taste. Similar as you put raw lamb meat to cook in microwave without any seasoning.!  This meal made me unwell and I rejected it.
I told flight attendant that this meal is unbeatable. She then suggested for last option to have a meal from economy class.
I couldn’t accept anything as my appetite was gone.
This gave me a lesson to pre book a meal before the flight or eat at the lounge where meals are prepared by proper chef and full kitchen. Not a microwave.",negative
6740,Singapore Airlines are not what they were We had a comfortable flight from Melbourne to Singapore . Coming back from Tokyo to Singapore  and Singapore to Melbourne was extremely uncomfortable for me.Tokyo was quite cool when we embarked  so had layered clothing on. We we seated in economy directly behind the front row where there is paid leg room. I am average size and sat in the middle of three seats. The person in front of me reclined all the time an my seat reclined only a little bit. Consequently my knees were touching the back of the front seat all the time an could barely move my arms either and was very hot and uncomfortable.  On the next flight form Singapore to Melbourne I thought I would feel better having removed a couple of layers of clothing expecting the flight to be warm. We were seated in the row in front of the back row where the air conditioned air for the whole plane came in (not overhead of individual seats). The whole row shivered in blankets the whole flight. It was not healthy and far too cold. The food was good and adequate.,negative
2997,"Missing luggage My trip with Singapore Airlines-SQ (business class) from Jakarta transit 1 hour in Singapore to Pudong, when check in i already make sure that luggage will directly transfer to Pudong.

How come such a big airlines had bad service ?!.

7013,"The very best airline the world has to offer by far Travelled out with my family from LHR on a 777-300er in economy which was incredibly enjoyable all the way. Literally managed to sleep like a baby as the seats were so comfortable the leg room brilliant with firm footrests the recline was like that of premium on most other airlines and the width at 19” is as good as you will find in the industry anywhere due to the generous 3-3-3 config where as most other airlines operating 777’s will squeeze in an extra seat to make a 3-4-3 configuration (try emirates for example!).Food and incredible choice of beverages fantastic help yourself snacks of various kinds whenever you want them the cabin crew were as always so professional friendly efficient and helpful. IFE is superb with a great range of movies and all manner of entertainment both new recent and old and a screen monitor which is massive for economy with a separate touch screen remote. Also excellent quality in ear headphones for you to keep!
Blankets pillows eye shades socks combs tooth paste/brush razors shave cream and vavrious other amenities all provided. Toilets spotless as was the cabin and it’s lovely calming ambinence.
Then onwards on a 3 week old 787-10 journey to Bali/1 year old A350 Jakarta - Singapore and brand new one month old A380 back to London with its equally and superb new cabin design.Again all these other sectors were also absolutely fantastic and replicated the initial outbound journey form LHR.Singapore Airlines fleet is incredibly new when compared to many other airlines they just keep getting better and better and never rest on their laurels for a moment.
Service levels are top notch both in the air and on the ground. CS team are always spot on and will do everything to help within there means I cannot fault it.
This airline has never once in my 25 years of flying with them disappointed or let me down in any way and you will not find a better airline in the skies today hence their number 1 status in skytrax and TA amongst others.

You would have to really be one of life’s miserable moaners to find much if any fault with SIA but unfortunately as we all know some people will complain about anything for various ‘motives’ no matter how good the product or service.

I highly recommend anyone to fly with this airline you won’t be disappointed and you will have a fantastic time on board.",positive

Her service was such a stark contrast after 3 weeks of the French's zero service. She just spoiled us! In addition, Ms Chiang Cheng-Pei and Ms Tay Yi Ling also evidently showed enormous passion for their work, which is hard to come by in today's society. Despite the limited resources available in the air, Ms Chiang Cheng-Pei even decorated the tray of mints very beautifully for us. Please find attached photo. Another pleasurable surprise!

She was very efficient and the food service had everything we wanted to order. Between meals there was a selection of snacks and chocolate.  Second flight from Singapore to Auckland smaller plane and the stewardess seemed so much slower, or maybe she had more passengers to look after, I am not sure. Anyway the choice of meals when she got to us was very limited. I have a mild nut allergy so there was nothing I could eat. The snacks between meals were limited too, no chocolate as on the first flight. The third and fourth flight were back to to a bigger plane, but again the snacks were limited and the ice cream they brought round was almond based with no alternative, so I could not have one. Drinks between the meal service were served on a request basis. The seats on all flights seemed very small for a long haul flight, I am only 5’ 3” and fairly slim, but I did not have enough room to be comfortable for such long flights.

Only after seeing a person on the seat in front having a beer I enquired if alcohol was available. I was told it was but you have to ask for it.

I'd fly with them again if I can find a good price.
Their hub on West coast seems to be at LAX so I would have to connect there to utilize them more.  Hope they will expand their stops.",positive
4871,"Good prices but service was pretty poor Good prices for flights but the service was pretty poor. Ran out of meal choice for entire economy class for dinner. Everyone was left with a disgusting fish pasta goop. Most were left barely touched. Never offered drinks on flight except with meals.
Return journey the food was much better, but after supper cabin crew disappeared.  Not once were drinks offered except with meals. Standard practice to keep passengers hydrated but not withthis airline. Paid extra for exit row seats for extended legroom. Seats are narrow. Customer service was awful. We booked 6 months ahead. But found out day before travel we were seated opposite sides of the plane. They were unwilling to remedy this. No upgrade or rejig seating . It took 5 phone calls and 4 hours to change flight for the following day",neutral
2064,"New A350 - 900 short haul  Again seats comfortable but configured differently to the long haul version. I would guess slightly less leg room but again not a problem. Food and service as expected from Singapore - excellent.
Minor dislike - seat belt for take off and landing lap strap plus shoulder to lap strap - a little uncomfortable but not in use for normal flying.",positive
3666,"Almost perfect We enjoy Singapore Airlines and prefer to pay a premium to get reasonable flights time travelling during daylight hours. For the travel from Perth to Phuket S.A. worked well, despite being twice the cost of low budget cariers that would take many more hours. Our less than perfect score related to a few glitches on the way home.Our deprture from Phuket was delayed by 45 minutes. 

This combined with a 65 minute connection in Singapore (a need to change terminals) and that we had been seated in different rows on the leg, saw the stress levels rising by the minute. 

An email to Singapore Airlines as soon as we found out we were travelling in diffrent rows was eventually answered theday after we travelled. However at the check in the customer service rep, raised an eyebrow as to why we weren't travelling together and quickly sorted it out. 

On arrival at Singapore the staf pulled out all the stops to transfer a dozen passengers to the connecting flight. To their credit we not only made the flight we arrived at the schduled time. Duty free shopping and a chance to stretch the legs at Singapore a long forgotten option.

The audio/visual equipment on the Singapore/ Perth leg didn't fully work on my wife's seat. Not a big problem and the dozen movies she could access satified her requirements.

Singapore Airlines, a great carrier, will continue to be a fan and fly again. This most recent flight was one of the few times we had less than a perfect experience.",positive
2288,"business class was great but not the best I have flown I am a Krisflyer and I upgraded to Business class.The flight was comfortable but found the service not as good as with other Airlines. Struggled to open my bed and only standing waiting and with irritation did someone show me how. Not many offers of coffee or something to drink. No mini bar available for the flight.  With other flights they put your mattress down, and make sure you are comfortable. I felt I was ignored.",neutral
721,"Poor experience Hi, I booked flight with Singapore airlines for my family (return ticket from (Sydney to Bangalore 24th December) for my family. 
I was told by Singapore airlines that my flight from Sydney to Singapore section is changed from SQ8517 to SQ8669 (same date, same time).

My ticketing agent is has sent several messages to Singapore airlines for alternative travel options for the last 1 week. Now Singapore airlines is saying we can pay you the money back as all the seats are full. This  is unacceptable. How can the seats be full when we have the tickets and we have the confirmation email directly from Singapore airlines.
We called Singapore airlines and one person agreed to provide us seats in the new flight. (Ref No: 03735724).

We booked this ticket 2 months in advance and booked my mothers surgery based on this itinerary. 
We are having an extremely bad experience with Singapore airlines.

Please honor your commitment and provide us the same tickets on your alternate flight.

Best regards

9344,"Long haul - no seat recline or entertainment! I had done the late evening flight from Perth to Singapore, so looking forward to relaxing and sleeping the next 10 - 11 hours to Johannesburg.  I was lucky to have selected a bulk head row, so my leg space was ideal, the entertainment on the wall in front (slightly larger screen) was perfect set up for my plan of a movie with dinner and sleep.

Unfortunately the hand controls for the 3 seats in my row did not function, so a lift out of the seat to touch the screen in front was the only way to manipulate your choice of entertainment. I then discovered my chair would not recline.  The flight attendants tried very hard to fix my seat - the plane was a full flight so there was no other seating option for me.  As mentioned earlier I was lucky I did have extra leg room, so the sleep position was not too bad.  In these cases, I would not hesitate to draft feedback emails to the airlines - I paid for entertainment from the ease of my chair and I also expected a reclining chair on my long haul flight.  To my absolute surprise, nearing the end of our flight as we were getting ready to land in Johannesburg, the senior flight attendant presented all 3 of us with a voucher and apologised profusely about the entertainment issue - he then cam round to me and presented me with another voucher for the inconvenience of my non-reclining chair.  The vouchers were to the value of $175.  Very impressed with the service Singapore Airlines",positive
2469,"Perfect as usual Perfect going over. I was dissappointed coming home as had booked and paid for an economy seat but was waitlisted for a business upgrade usoing my extensive Krisflyer points. On check in, I was told that there were business seats available for the Male to Singapore section but because I was only a Silver Kriscard holder, I was not able to use my points to obtain a business seat upgrade!! Very very annoying as it would have been a great way to have used up some of my over 200,000 krisflyer points. What's the use of them if they won't let you use them when the opportunity arises?",positive

Lots of space for seating, luggage and large, gel windows. The entertainment system , had an excellent choice - one or two compulsory ads but fair considering what you get in return. The food was great - Chicken and potatoes, caramel ice-cream, noodle salad - a generous portion of everything including the service: absolutely on point. The staff were dedicated, service minded and even found time to be charming. You win Singapore Airlines - when we fly again on this route - It's you and only you.",positive

6049,"Excellent even in Business Class Singapore airline doesn't have First Class on SIN-SFO route. Flying on Mar 31, the business class only has one sit available at the front section, the crew team was outstanding, compared to the first class, I have to say the business class team was extraordinary, they can take care every guest for everything and every requested with a timely manner.

I would like to special thanks to the on-duty captain, sadly I forgot his name, he is such a nice and gentle guy with his smile and personality, is hard for you to not like him, I guess his crew must be very enjoyable to work with him, thanks for your honey tea and some snack. And a very beautiful female crew who work at the front business class section too, she was so helpful and efficient, my Choya on the rock so tasty, thank you. Sorry, I couldn't remember everyone's name, there a still one gentleman was really nice. However, I couldn't remember. Many thanks for everyone's hard work, will definitely fly Singapore airline again.

P.S. To Singapore airline chef, Please improve the Soto Ayam, Sorry but I have to say that's the worst Soto Ayam I ever had. Thank you!",positive
8258,"Undisputed No.1 airline in the world Whilst I am a top tier frequent flyer with SIA and have flown 100s of flights with them, I realised I had not reviewed them here.

I will not fly any other airline if I can help it.  They are simply exceptional.  Whilst I am lucky to fly First Class mostly, it is the warmth of the service from the crew that you will experience in any cabin.  They really serve from the heart, nothing is too much trouble and they are so intuitive.

I get a buzz of excitement whenever I am about to board an SQ flight - it's one of the best parts of the trip and sometimes you just wish the flight was longer!

Keep up the good work SQ.  You soar ahead of the next best and you hand down beat the competition on product and service alike.",positive
9545,"Adelaide to Colombo Singapore airlines offers the best route from Adelaide to Colombo, Sri Lanka in a day. On line check in and a 30kg luggage allowance provides hassle free worries.

Worth considering this airline for  a continuous flight to your destination if available.",positive
794,Very let down Travelled with my partner and our two children to visit family in Ireland with a stopovers both ways. There was trouble from before we even flew when we weren't given the seats promised. My partner then had to spend several hours on the phone to try and get it all resolved only for it to be changed back anyway. The crux of the issue appeared to be that they left out youngest (<1) off our booking. She had a ticket but it wasn't connected to the rest of us. We ended up with 3 long haul flights with no kids meals. Even had one flight where the seat they had allocated for our 3 year old had her sitting by herself. We spent another 2 hours while on our holiday trying to sort it all out for our return leg but no one would take ownership. The call centre people wouldn't put us on to a supervisor and on more than one occasion even tried to end calls with us simply because they couldn't fix this issue. It was in the 'too hard' basket. We were promised call backs that never happened. We couldn't do online check in because of the issue which meant standing in queues for an age. When I tried to explain it all to the service desk in Singapore on our way home the best they could do was put us to the front of the queue after we'd already been waiting 45 mins. No apologies or even willingness to understand the issue. We paid a lot of money for these flights on the basis that Singapore Airlines is supposed to be good. They definately were not. We have flown with Emirates previously with our first child and the service we got from them was out of this world. Perhaps Singapore Airlines could learn a thing or two.,negative

3925,It was as expected  I would have probably liked a bit more fruit available through the long flight.

Now when I wants to change date they offering me $ 1531 to escape refund situation on the other side same ticket they offering @ $ 1284 each to others or new customers.

6514,"Friendly Cabin Crew, Great Service, Unrivalled Inflight Entertainment, and Yummy Food I was able to experience the new Business Class seats, which I thought looked smaller but was surprisingly comfortable.

There were more places to keep your items as the placement of storage areas were well thought of. 

For example, the many newspapers one would normally grab before boarding, could now be slotted neatly where the inflight magazine and menu is kept.

There is also a storage area, just below the pop-up table/tray, where you can comfortably place a water bottle.

USB port & headphone jack are within reach with a conveniently located side table top (above the pop-up table/tray).  Oh, it's quite cool to just push a button to ""eject"" the tray - easy and no effort required!

Space below? Lots of it! You can store your back-pack, notebook and still have space to stretch your feet. Sweet!

The inflight entertainment? It's really good.

My only complaint is the poor wifi connectivity and the difficulty to link my phone to the inflight system via the SQ mobile app....mmmm (btw, it was fine on the SQ flight from SG to Beijing though and in my previous SQ flights).  

And the cabin crew on this flight? Very friendly and it's always nice when they remember your name when you disembark - top marks!

As the tagline says, ""a great way to fly"" :)",positive
6429,"Attention by cabin crew is courteous and good. Check-in was expeditious and helpful with a wheel chair for my wife. Most helpful in particular to my wife who needed disability attention. All requests were attended to promptly. However, seats were not comfortable; perhaps due to age of the aircraft. Meals were ordinary and not palatable. Baggage claim was uneventful as bagge was slow to appear on the carousel. Attention of cabin staff was professional.",positive

3811,"Absolutely fantastic, extremely friendly and professional As a major treat to myself, and to make visiting my sister in Australia bearable, I decided to fly business class.  My routing was LHR - SIN - PER - then Virgin Australia on code share to BNE, then BNE - SIN - LHR.  Singapore Airlines are consistently ranked in the top airlines in the world, and for good reason.
Every aspect of my interaction with them was outstanding.  The seat on the A380 was fantastic and very private, the food and service outstanding, the crew professional, and friendly - learning your name and addressing you by name throughout the flight, with nothing too much trouble.  I flew on the A380, A350 and 777.  For sleeping I found the 777 had the most space and was most comfortable, then the A380,  The A350 is more of a regional rather than long haul offering, and the seat was less comfortable and spacious as a result.  But all in all, I loved every minute of flying Business Class with SQ - the lounges, the pre boarding and first off / priority luggage off, as well as the pre departure champagne on board.  Worth every penny!",positive

7809,"Nice long distance flight We always choose to travel by Singapore Airline. This year December holiday we took Singapore Airline to Barcelona. It was a full flight, maybe 5 to 10 seats not occupied. There are some babies and toddlers on the flight. Generally the flight was comfortable with some mild turbulence. The crew worked tirelessly to serve the passengers. During the 14hours flight they give out water regularly, almost every hour. Plenty of snacks (sandwiches, crackers, peanuts, fruits) available at any time.
The meal was a supper and breakfast and both are pretty good, although unfortunately most passengers prefer the noodle dish rather than the sausage dish for breakfast, buy most of them do get their 1st choice.

Plenty of toilets available and if you go before meal service and arrival, you don't really have to queue for it.
The entertainment system is superb with large screen and plenty of movies, music and games to choose from, including for the kids.
There is plenty of space at the overhead compartments with many compartments not full.
Definitely the best way to fly to Spain.",positive

Not good enough Changi Airport",positive
325,Highest standards This review is for a return journey.  We flew the Brisbane Singapore route on the A350 900 regional aircraft and the A380 on the Singapore London route.  The regional aircraft is very comfortable in both sitting and lying.  We were not as comfortable in the A380.  Sitting up straight and lying down was okay but lounging was very uncomfortable with a seam in the seat that ground into one's coccyx. We had window seats mostly and they  felt very private.  The staff were exceptional as always on all flights and the bathrooms were kept clean and tidy.  The choice of food was best from Book the Cook and there was an excellent wine choice.  Speciality coffees are welcome.  We unfortunately heard criticism from other passengers when we were delayed boarding on one flight.  I do think we need to be more generous and understand the world is still getting back on its feet since COVID-19.  Thank you Singapore Airlines.  You made our trip memorable and nothing was too much trouble.,positive

The service is unbeatable and is worth the occasional extra $$ when compared with other airlines. The stewards and stewardess are always friendly and accommodating. I have never had to ask anyone for help to put my bags up on the overhead compartment on SQ, but on an occasion have had to bear through grimace with some unnamed American airlines. Inflight entertainment is awesome but meals on this flight can be improved as I have had better quality food on long hauls from SF or LA to Asia. Must agree, a little expensive compared to other airlines I've tried, but I rather pay more for a little more comfort through a long journey.",positive
7372,"Delhi to Singapore seemed too short a flight... The check in was easy, and the Silver Kris lounge at Delhi was very relaxing and provided just the right amount of refreshments and food items. All the ground staff were friendly and efficient (don't get me started on the airport officials though... but that is another story), and the inflight crew looked like they stepped out of a fashion magazine and just had their hair and makeup professionally done, but we all know they were just like us, rushing to the airport from their hotels... The food served during the flight was surprisingly good, and my wife who always sleeps through what she says are boring meals, surprised me by eating most of her supper. Amazing. The movies on board were another pleasant diversion that made me regret (sort of) the ""short"" flight because I calculated that I could only watch 2 movies out of the hundreds available. Oh well, we can always look forward to the next time.",positive
3983,"Flying Business Class I have flown with Singapore airlines many times and cannot fault their service. Business class adds a new dimension in service and comfort with their lie flat beds a real treat on long haul flights. The seats are extremely comfortable and the crew really do try to make your journey as pleasant and trouble free as possible.
Now you would assume that this would guarantee 5/5 but unfortunately there is one serious fault. The toilets are too small and there are not enough of them. This is a major flaw in an otherwise terrific service.

I hadn't flown on Singapore Airlines before but heard good things about it.

The first thing I did was download the Singapore Airlines mobile app. I'm able to use it for international check in for the Singapore Airlines flights.

Boarding was pretty easy and the seat was a good size. It had plenty of leg room and an entertainment system with a lot of movies/music.

The cabin crew were efficient and polite.

I experienced the complimentary hot towels at the beginning of the flight. That was a nice way to start the flight.

The inflighy meals are were tasty and perfect for the flights.

The one thing I was amazed by were the complimentary toothbrush/tooth paste and combs in the bathroom. That was pretty nice as it meant I didn't have to grab my own one out of my bag.

I also had to call customer service from Sri Lanka to book the flights I had found online, for some reason my card wouldn't work so the customer service call line was brilliant, the lady booked the seats and organised my payment.

6423,"Exceptional, but not without Issues Our direct flight going to Singapore (18hrs) was everything I had hoped for from “the best airline in the world”, but not without issues. My seat pod had some issues with the movie/audio system. The flight attendants were immediately apologetic, attentive and helpful in trying to reset my individual seat’s system. After multiple tries, they couldn’t get it fixed, but were able to move my wife and I (traveling together, seated side by side) to different seats. It was a mechanical error and they handled it pleasantly and quickly, enough said. However, an hour later, the flight attendant manager came back and apologized for our issue and gave me a sizable airline voucher, that I could also use to shop in their in-air Kriss magazine. Now that’s over and above.
Our return direct flight (14hrs - tail wind) had some issues as well, but those were flight attendant related. Again, my wife and I are seated side by side. The flight attendant handling my side of the plane was having some issues. It was easily apparent by their  demeanor and the consoling of the other attendants. As a result, they were less attentive and somewhat absent the entire flight. I know, because I saw the attendant on my wife’s side come numerous times asking if there was anything they needed.
To sum it up, our first flight was a 5+ star service flight and the second was a 4. So, I can’t truely give them a 5-star rating, but I don’t want to hold an airline accountable for one flight attendant having a bad day...we all have them. However, I can give them a 4-star with an explanation and recommendation of it being a 4+ star.",positive

47,"Great Service - Terrible Aircraft Everything about our trip was amazing other than the plane on the longest part of our journey.

Our first flight was from Phuket > Singapore …… the service and staff were excellent and went over the top for a short haul flight. Very pleasantly surprised.

Our second flight was from Singapore > London Heathrow. 

The staff were beyond perfect.
The service was by far the best I’ve ever experienced from an airline.

The only disappointment throughout our entire trip was the plane. 
Singapore Airlines decided that for this 14hr 25min flight it would be  acceptable to put us in an out dated and run down 777 that really looked and felt its age. Im pretty sure it was nearly 20 years old and it really showed. 

Damaged upholstery, old toilets, out dated accessories, very loud and noisey  ect…..

I had been looking forward to flying with “the best airline in the world” but unfortunately we experienced that in service but not the facilities.

Come on SA ……. Surely this isn’t right?",positive
8869,"New plane This was the new Singapore Airlines plane from London to Singapore. I have to say I was quite worried as the picture of ecconomy class were few and far between. 
On the way out from London we got a row of 4 seats in the middle, they were supprisingly spacious and the arms lifted up, this was a benefit to us as we were a family and this created more space. It also aloud children to lean on you when they slept. The head rests also bend which make things a little more comfortable. The only problem was how cold the plane is kept, not sure if this is for a specific reason but wrap up before boarding.

The service was good, which is what they are famous for, the staff are super friendly and seem genuinely kind. 

In the return journey we paid for seat in the seat forward section expecting to board first etc but this is not the case you board last? 
We also opted for the 42 k seat ? which has the extra leg room however when you choose these seats there is no overhead storage as all the emergency equipment is there. So your bags are put at the back in random places. This makes getting off the plane impossible as no one will let you through to retrieve your bags and then they will not let you back to you seat again as they want to get off the plane before you even though the plane is not allowing anyone off yet!!
The other down side to this seat aswell is the screen is folded down not on the back of a chair, which is fine but if you want to sit to eat your food you have your knees at 90 degrees and there is no leg room as the casing for the screen digs in to your legs. So you have to spend the whole flight with your legs stretched out! The seat also feels narrower and the arm rest is fixed.

In the end we would recommend just opting for the middle seats and leave these well alone.",positive

501,"Customer service rep. commended Flight booked for travel in May.
Usually cautious, I advertently called a scam travel agency disguised as SA inquiring on how to complete the name fields on their website.
By the time I realized I was being scammed, they had already gotten my booking reference number and last name.
Lesson learned.
The scammer did not have my credit card details but had access to my reservation and could change or cancel my reservation at any time.
I pleaded with several SA agents to protect my booking reference by adding a password or change my number to no avail.
Finally, I was lucky to have this amazing SA agent take my call. 
He was very cordial.  When I explained what happend, he  submitted a request to a change my booking reference number.  He called the next day to confirm approval of a new number and patiently went through my reservation to be sure the information was accurate.

4146,"Brilliant Staff Give Brilliant Service In July 2019 we had 4 connecting flights in total; Manila - Singapore - London then 2 weeks later the return trip London - Singapore - Manila. The cabin crew on all flights were 100% brilliant. Honestly they could not have been better. My wife is disabled and can only walk a little with assistance and received willing hands to guide her on and off the plane. During the flights the food and service was the best I have had for economy class. Polite, courteous, cheerful teams. Very pleased with Singapore Airlines - definitely the best.   However the airport ground staff left a lot to be desired at Singapore and London Heathrow. On the outward trip at Singapore they lost our own wheel chair for more than 10 minutes. Confusion abounded while they used an airport wheelchair to put my wife into the special assistance buggy and despite our protests about the whereabouts of my wife's chair they were about to drive off to the next terminal.when someone arrived with the chair.  Then the assistant helped us to the next terminal and took us to a special lounge for  passengers who needed assistance, where we had to leave my wife's boarding card. We had no intention of staying in there for 2 hours, hidden away from 3 other family members, so we moved out, found the others and made our way through the shops towards the gate for the London flight. But then I needed to let the assistance people know we were at the gate and didn't need their service. A very surly response at the lounge while the lady shuffled some papers and tapped her terminal, ""You can't cancel now I have all these to deal with."" ""I just want to take her boarding card and I will be on my way"" ""No you will have to wait."" 5 minutes later, "" Have you got her passport?"" - So i had to walk back to the gate and get the passport then return to the lounge. Eventually received the boarding pass but to this day I cannot understand why they needed it behind the desk. In the gate, we had a helpful assistant and onto the plane with no problem. 
Return Journey from London and what a farce Heathrow check-in is. I had already completed on-line check-in but we have to join hundreds of confused people milling around the various check-in terminals where it's supposed to print our boarding cards but didn't print for all the party. Then we have to attach our own bag tags before moving to another queue to hand over the bags. What they achieve by this self service check-in is unknown to me. Instead of 1 orderly queue we used to have we now have 1 chaotic queue to use the self service check in (having paid the same amount of money that we used to pay someone else to do it ) then join a second queue to check-in the bags. Then just as we were to board the plane we, a party of 5 were stopped because they thought we had checked in 7 bags. We had only checked in 5 bags plus wheelchair. This guy was insisting we have to find the one additional bag - which we knew nothing about. Then a senior person arrived and allowed us through. London Airport = Total inefficiency. Arrival at Singapore and told there is no wheelchair. by the ground crew. I told him I saw it handed over at the plane's door when we entered at London. ""No, it's not on my memo, so we don't have it."" A 5 minute argument then took pace when we were even told ""She will have to walk.""  Eventually the correct wheelchair appeared at the doorway, so off we went. Arrival in the Philippines could not have been more different. Wheelchair built for the plane aisle used inside, our own wheelchair ready and waiting at the doorway and escorted all the way through the baggage claim, border check and customs, no problem at all.

2491,"Singapore Airlines First Class A-380 Suite I was Fortunate to get a Points upgrade from Business on the Second leg from Adelaide to Shanghai.
Wow I thought Emirates First Class was good. This is better Suite wise but with Less Bling Bling.
   Suite is enormous almost like a Study or Office Space.  2 x Plasma Screens. Booked ahead online and Got pre Booked Lobster Thermadore ! yum

   Seat is a full 360 Degrees seat plus the added comfort of a pullout full size bed which is not the same seat so 2 different seating zones great if you want a nap and then food comes you don't have to put seat up and start allover again. Very Private and there is ability to book 2 Suites which can be turned into a double Suite providing a Full Size Double bed for your Partner. (which Have booked for April next year so will write again.

Flew over in First on old 777 was like chalk and Cheese really 777 First is not worth the extra over business but certainly on A380 a Huge Jump. Invitation to the First Lounge and Private room at Singapore was also a Nice Touch were I was greeted by Concierge who Seemed to know my name and greeted me by my name without even seeing my boarding pass which was a shock However upon entry to lounge which was enormous and could easily seat 100 people (not private room) I notice there was only 3 other people there so lacked any ambience and was almost Library Quite I then realised how she knew my name as was the only person they were expecting!. Me and my guest actually turned around and went in Business Lounge!! 

Only upper hand that Emirates has is the Full Bar in Business class Singapore has no Bar on Plane nor does it have the Fantastic Shower that Emirates operate in First.

Flight attendant did not pay attention then gave me a salad sauce instead of coke and tea lemon. I was speechless and shocked with salad sauce...I repeated my request for hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant politely smiled and skipped my request. I flew 2 1/2 hours and did not get any hot tea and coke. I think there was poor attention and poor sloppy service.

Flight was 100% full and despite having an oversized passenger alongside I was not inconvenienced due to adequate seat width and pitch + he was very polite and contained limbs within his own space.
Meal service was very slow as cabin crew repeatedly attended to minor pax requests.  The chicken dish was very ordinary thigh meat in an indiscernible sauce of dubious origins.

540,"This rating is solely given for the crew's immaculate service & excellent skills of the pilot's on both to & fro trips We travelled on Suite class on SQ A380 both ways to & fro Sin Ldn about 2 weeks ago. 

We have also done First Class from Singapore and returned from London in 777 suite pre-COVID before.

This review is a comparison for these 2 trips both Sin-Ldn and back.

Cons:  

1)   Pre-Covid FOOD served on Board --- We were extremely impressed with our first class trip from Sin - Ldn.  I am a foodie.  The food served on this leg was very memorable.  We always order the lobster from book the cook because my partner loves to eat seafood and for me I was never once impressed with their lobtser served on their business class normaly. 

This pre-COVID first class trip meal was the best I ever had on SQ. The lobster was done very well and prepared more extravagantly than what we were normally offered on normal business class. U could tell it's first class with a big difference.  Pre-COVID, SQ also offer delicious Japanese Kaiseki Meal on First class which we paired with sake.  Really felt like having a Michelin star meal. 

- Recent trip on A380 suite from Sin to Ldn. Food in the Private Room was good. We had lobster in laksa gravy. The lobster was fresh and laksa gravy was good.  We did not eat much because we have ordered our meal on board from book the cook.
It was a mistake; we should have had our full meal in the private room before boarding the plane because after that all the main courses quality went downhill.  

We ordered the lobster and beef from Book the Cook.  There is no difference in terms of taste, quality or presentation from the Business Class we flew to France 2 months prior.  Very ordinary and was not tasty at all.  The beef was overly salted. In fact I prefered the beef cheek I have ordered for our business class to France. Didn't expect the Food on Suite can be so disappointing. Total letdown. 

The only saving grace was a delicious chinese clear soup served from Sin to Ldn.  The same  soup was served on our returned flight and was not tasty at all.  

Food on both return flights from London to Sin was not palatable.  The mains were bad and the dessert was even worse.  i even commented to a flight stewardess that some economy class box meals on regional flights tasted much better.  

2)  In my opinion the seat for Suite class is not as comfortable as the business or first class seat.  The only plus point is you get an extra double bed if you travel with a partner. To be honest I much prefer a business / First Class seat.

3) Business class 2 months ago-  Passenger will not be provided with amenity kit if one does not request.  Unlike in the past the stewardess will ask if you would like to have one.

4) Suite class Feb 2023 - There is no lip gross in the amenity bag.  Luckily I brought one along myself.  SQ used to include little crystal fishes' ornament in the past for your collection but now not anymore. There are not many items provided.  So please bring your own.

Pro:

1) It's spacious.  You will have the feeling that you're staying in a small hotel room rather than on an airplane.

2) Service. 
    i)  Pre-Covid service on First Sin- London was excellent + excellent
        returned trip on SQ 777 suite was forgettable

   ii)  Recent trip to & fro Sin - London on A380 suite, all the crews were very attentive and prefessional.  

I flew with my partner.  SQ has sent an email to my partner requesting for a review but I didn't received one.   Hence this review.",neutral

763,"No More the Gold Standard! Returning from Norway we flew Singapore Airlines on two long haul flights, Heathrow to Singapore and then Singapore to Melbourne on their Boeing 777-300ER. Although we were in Premium Economy, there was nothing premium about the service. For starters there were no complimentary amenity bags despite these being long haul flights. When requested, it took the crew member a long time to return to us with an old looking amenities bag which had obviously seen better days. All it had was a cheap pair of orange socks and a toothbrush/toothpaste. The food was nothing to shout about and the service was inattentive. The seats were uncomfortable and trying to find a comfortable position to sleep even with having taken a sleeping tablet proved difficult. What was truly disappointing was the fact that the toilets had to be shared with Economy. It meant a walk to the back of the plane to join the always long queue! Definitely not a premium service and not worth the money spent. Standards have fallen due to complacency! Won’t fly this airline or recommend to anyone else. Another airline now wears the crown; we’ll definitely consider the other airline.",negative

--The food was fairly poor by Business standards.  (better artisan breads would have saved a mediocre take-off meal)  

--The furniture is outdated and needs a re-do.  The cabin's lie-flat beds seemed like they were from the first generation of true lie flats. You have to manually turn the back down and the average person would have a hard time putting it back up.  I saw flight attendants put their full body weight on the bed to release the lock.  They were actually pretty good for sleeping, but there was no opening for leg room directly in front of you to stretch your legs while sitting upright.  You have to turn cock-eyed diagonal in your seat to put your feet up and twist forward to face the tv screen.  

--Check-in and customer service is very good and I could see here how they really shine in other ""more important"" locations.  The business class lounge in Changi airport is really, really good.  Really.  It should be the standard for most of the other big airline lounges.

Hope they fix it.",neutral
1502,"Very Comforting The flight from Brisbane to Jakarta via Singapore was very comfortable even though I was in Economy. I had a window seat. The only unfortunate part about having a window seat that if you need to go to the toilet or stretch our legs you have to ask the 2 passengers to move! So, when they got up to go to the toilet I did too!! The crew were very courteous and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble! The plane was clean and tidy and smelt fresh. The meals were very nice - lunch and a snack. (It was a midmorning flight.)  We landed in Singapore and had to change planes at Singapore and had to rush from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4. There was  45 minutes between flights. If anyone knows Singapore airport, sometimes there can be delays and trying to get from one terminal to another can be very rushed. I managed to get to the right terminal and boarding gate in time. The flight from Singapore to Jakarta was very good too. I had a seat with plenty of leg room. Shame the flight was only about 1.5 hrs.  Again the crew were very courteous and friendly. Because of the Corona Virus, all the crew wore masks throughout both flights.

6819,"Good but not the same as a few years ago I have made this trip a few times on different airlines but on this occasion SIN made sense due to price on Business Class.  I used to fly with them all the time and always gave them a 5 star rating and couldn't fault them for service or facilities.  This time I was disappointed on a couple of things when compared to other airlines.  First of all the business class on the B777 is not to the same standard as on their A380 and was only comparable to Premium Economy on other airlines. Surprisingly there were no amenities bags as on all other airlines Business Class.  Even economy class pax get an amenities bag when travelling at night.  I had two 12/13 hour flights so expected something.  I didn't find the entertainment system as good as others.  On other airlines they have had the latest films but these were older so little to watch on my long journeys.  The food was good but choice not as wide with lots of chicken and not much else.  Only different from economy in that it was served on plates. As usual service from staff was good but even that was hit and miss.

4459,"Poor arrangement and ground services when on a delayed flight Due to closure of Changi runway, the KL-SPORE flight was delayed and as such, we missed our connecting flight to Christchurch on SQ297. The overall experience was extremely disappointing and VERY POORLY managed for the onwards journey.
We are travelling in a group of 3 including my elderly mother aged 75 yo. Upon arrival at Changi, SIA provided alternative arrangements on 2 different flights. I told the ground staff that we have an EXCEPTION case here (and expect an exception handling case). I am travelling with my elderly mother which is dependent on me. We need to travel on the same flight and NOT on 2 different flights. 
I was told to liaise with Krisflyer directly as mine was on redemption ticket and my mum on a paid ticket. Despite me being in Changi i.e Singapore and that we missed the connecting flight due to reasons beyond our control, I was seeking some kind assistance to help with the rebooking of flights with some urgency as the next flight of which my mother was on will depart just under 2 hours for Melbourne and then onwards journey to Christchurch. I was just offered a phone and I have to spend more than an hour or more in a stressful situation to convince both Krisflyer on the PHONE and ground staff to help me on this exception request. Many calls and discussions between SIA, Krisflyer, SATS and myself follow through. With much regret, SIA reputation did not live up to its name and my expectation, having very good experience in the past. Rightfully, in a situation like this someone within SIA should take charge of the entire situation without having passengers kept in the waiting and pursue/manage/deal with different teams. At the very last, SIA allowed me on the flight to Melbourne  45 mins before departure, thanks to a gentleman by the name of Mr. LIM.
Apart from incurring extra expenses and a lost baggage (upon arrival), I wish to raise this to SIA that you have caused unnecessary stress among us – not that I am claiming any damages whatsoever but please look into this with utmost importance so that this does not repeat if similar case were to happen in the future for your passengers.

Starting with the good:
Food service as absolutely great.
Attendants service was wonderful
Drink & alcohol selection was good
I was extremely disappointed by the seat configuration, which while in the layflat position, actually forces you to try and sleep diagonally (for me, legs to the left).
I was not able to get 1 minute of sleep due to this
for comparison, flight back was with Swiss - Normal business seat - Slept 8 hours like a baby...
Another small thing: I was very surprised that they don't give away amenity kits to business class passengers, not to mention Pajamas (which are very common with other Asian airlines on long haul flights)",neutral

The online booking of tickets does take time with intricate details and mistakes, if one does not have a family name/surname ! 
It was long but tedious journey and the only saving grace being the excellent service in the aircraft. Food was good but the drinks were rationed.

I booked a window seat but they put me just in the middle which it is completely opposite of what I wanted. I complained on the plane but nobody wanted to help me, then I complained when I landed in London and according to them, I selected a middle seat (the customer service in London was quite rude). Why would I select a middle seat prior to my flight if this is not what I wanted? Anyway, they said in the end that because they are right, there is no way they can help me.

15hours of flight in a seat that you do not want to be at is not the best experience. 

In general, I would say and after flying with other airlines in economy to Singapore that the service for most of them is pretty much the same. I paid a plus of 350£ for this airline for the good things I heard about them but it is not worth the money. Also, I never had this issue. Hence my struggle to understand why this airline is so good.",negative
9498,"Damaged Luggage Policy - APPALLING Singapore Airlines' damaged luggage policy is appalling - it excludes damage to wheels, handles and even cuts to your baggage - see copy of policy below.  It appears that SA doesn't actually cover any damage to your suitcases.       I just returned from a trip to China and found that the handle on my expensive Samsonite suitcase had been damaged.  I have traveled a lot (mostly with Qantas) so knew that I had to immediately report the damage at the airport.  However, at the baggage counter for Singapore Airlines, the exclusions were pointed out to me. The exclusions are extensive - see below. I couldn't believe that Singapore Airlines will not cover damage that they have done to your suitcases.  Seriously?  However, I would like to note that the lady at the Counter was very empathetic and nice to me - which took a bit of the sting out of SA's horrible policy.

4331,"Premium Economy Singapore to Amsterdam - Not Value for Money. Our first experience flying this class with Singapore was booked as part of an Air NZ flight from Auckland to Amsterdam so we boarded this flight after first having traveled premium with Air NZ (which was far superior). We liked the Singapore premium check in service, as this was separate from economy so it was fast with no queues, and boarding the plane was also better as premium boarded separately from economy. After that, things were not so great. Seats were leather and looked really nice but width and leg room were almost no different from economy, toilets were shared with economy, and there was no separation from economy area either so the economy rows just continued after the last designated premium row, with economy  seats sticking out into the aisle. We also found this same layout on Lufthansa and it was just weird.This also meant you were still sharing the same space as economy so got no respite from the usual noise, slow food service, toilet queues and other disruptions of economy. We were lucky and had bulkhead seats on the return flight  so we had good leg room and could easily get out of the seats, but on the first flight we were in the second row and my husband could not get out of his seat without asking the person beside him to get up as there simply was not enough room between the seat rows. Air NZ is much roomier in both width and leg room, and in recline. Food was average, there was a menu to choose from. We have flown in economy for this same trip on several other occasions, and in our opinion for the extra cost of premium seats, we don't think it was worth it. Basically we paid extra for a faster check in and that is about it. Singapore  is overall still one of our favorite airlines but they need to re-think their premium economy offering.",neutral

She was unsure of everything and was constantly being scolded by the superior in our section. I grimaced with how horrible she was. She was playing with a baby during take off and landing when she should be focused. She didn’t know our class couldn’t use business class bathrooms. She also gave the wrong food when we told her what was wanted. Basically, she failed miserably in her job performance. This made air Asia and other budget carriers look so much more competent. The flight was fine but for such a Long flight it would be nice to have a children section in both classes as babies were screaming for the duration of the flight making me wish I took a different flight.",neutral

7410,Best service I have flown many airlines and I have to say that this airline goes above and beyond to make your flight comfortable.   Friendly flight attendants.  Extremely polite and helpful.  Clean and even on a short 3 hour flight we had a meal.  I booked this flight on points with star alliance but didn’t realize my preferences were not transferred and I  am vegan.  The staff went out of their way to get me something I could eat.  Other airlines should take note. This is how it should be done.  Well done SQ.  I will definitely fly with you again.,positive
1154,Refund I had 13 days left for my passport to expire so I should have not even been able to go on the flight. On top of that they didn't even check how many days I had left to my passport to expire. Then on the flight they didn't treat me good  on the flight. They brought me pork and didn't respect that I couldn't eat it. Then when I got to Germany they didn't allow me to exit the airlines and brought me to the police station and kept me there for 7 - 8 hours. Then I had to buy my flight back  even though I was supposed to get the flight back for free. I want a refund and get my $841 back.,negative
2819,"Singapore Airlines to Bali The check in system at Changi was all system based. We did it by our self and was hassle free. Even though we reached 3 hours prior to our flight, me and my wife could not get seats together. May be the seats were already taken beforehand/online. The flight experience was excellent and cabin crew were very helpful and polite. The 2 hours 40 minutes flight was perfect and smooth.",positive

2080,Did not meet expectations The service was matter of fact. Warmth and friendliness was missing. The food was average. It had cauliflower salad and a cauliflower curry! Too much rice and too little curry.,neutral
2133,"Just ok Have travelled business with Singapore a few times and the service was exceptional. This time my family flew a mixture of Premier Economy and Economy to Perth. I have to agree with other reviews you don’t get much extra with Premier economy. Having said that you did get a bit of extra seat width which is the biggest benefit. 

We paid for extra leg room for our Sons in Economy and they had great seats when flying in the A380. I think paying for extra leg room is very good value for money on these trips to Australia. However they were not at all impressed with the food offering and snacks. All very limited, unless you like Asian food, you will be disappointed. Also if you happen to be the last to be served as we were on our leg to Perth or as my Sons were on the return today to London, food choices ran out! That’s not acceptable when so much money is being paid.

Overall I’m not saying I wouldn’t fly Singapore again, but I’ll be looking at other airlines next time I fly to Australia or that part of the world before I make a decision.

As an aside, I also think Singapore IT platform needs updating and spending up. The site is clunky, slow and the app isn’t much better.

Look hard at your options before booking.",neutral
3950,"The good and bad of business Our plane was the A350-900, fairly new and comfortable seating, but a bit tight with the leg room when trying to sleep on a long haul I felt. The food choices were good, if a little sparse for business class, and the drink selection as per usual was very good.
Found the entertainment choice not as good as it had been on other flights, must have been a quiet time at the box office.
This leads me to the age old question of what to do on a flight which has young children on it, like ours did, and who are restless to the extreme with continuous crying causing a lack of sleep for everyone. No real answer to that problem is there, as we all paid the same money to be there, it just kind of spoilt the trip for us who are light sleepers. Headphones and alcohol only go halfway to solving the problem, and the staff seemed powerless. As we landed, both children slept the sleep of innocents!",neutral

9324,"Smooth transition for flights, and great care by cabin crew for restful travel Singapore Airlines works well for Economy and Business Class for long haul flights. The seats for international leg are decent for leg room. The cabin crew are also generous in ensuring passengers are well hydrated during the flights. 
On the return leg, we allowed for time to break the flights into two phases and stayed over two nights in Singapore. It doesn't costs much more to do that (for flights) and the additional cost is the accommodation in Singapore but it is worthwhile as thats gives you bonus of time in Singapore plus time to unwind in a place with same time zone, so that you are able to return to life routines and work challenges with a fresher mind and body.",positive

Travelling with Singapore airlines was truly satisfying. From the food to the service to the smiling crew to the overall comfort, everything was great, regardless it being economy.
We travelled Melbourne to Singapore and back, however on the way we continued our journey to Athens with Scoot. Now that is a different story!!! I felt like I hopped off a 5 star hotel and onto a 2 star. I think that may be for another review!!!",positive
225,"Skip Business Class Singapore Airlines Beds -my torso was not in line with my legs so turning on side meant you were sleeping in a zigzag position and when on the other side you could not bend your knees. This is a design fault and needs to be corrected. This is not good for anybody who has any back issues.
Loading -no flight call in lounge at Singapore that's okay but when arrival at gate on appointed time about 20 business passengers were left waiting whilst premium economy was loaded first and seats from 47 upwards economy were also loaded. All before business class. Smooth and early loading is one of the reasons I chose business class.

However, the health procedures take sometime (there is heath quarantine)  form to complete online.  I ask question incorrectly which results in some delay (to my frustration).   The normal passport control and security -pretty easy.  The Shenzhen International Terminals has no shops open and no restaurants.   There is only vending machines for drinks only (poor!) and even all the drinks are not there.    Board on time.  There is about 30 minute delays as passengers are still passing through health controls.   Business Class seat (lie flat is comfortable) but the enclosing dividers for cubicle makes in seat tramped.  This is shame, and only fault of this plane.  Large passengers would find this uncomfortable and the arm would be pressed in - its obviously management did not test with large passengers.  No beverage service prior to departures, but cabin crew were make coffee / tea for passengers (on case by case basis). I was never asked, but don’t like or coffee.   However, my preordered drinks (whisky & Coke) came pretty quickly.   About 20 minutes (after departure).    I chose the beef option (see below) .

We had read much of the press that detailed all of the preparation recommended for the long flight. None of it turned out to be necessary for us. From the moment we boarded until our landing in Singapore the extraordinary service form the Singapore Air crew was extraordinary. Being a long flight we were able to relax, settle in and enjoy our time together. There was a screaming baby issue that disturbed our sleep for about three hours. Everything else was flawless. The timing of the meals, the sleeping hours, and the lighting all worked together to acclimate us to Singapore time. We arrived feeling rested and ready for the evenings activities.

You're welcomed on to the flight with beaming smiles and shown to your seat. The seats are very comfortable with adequate leg room even for those over 6foot. The entertainment system is fantastic, and you get to watch it on a beautifully large screen, and have the use of a console to control the screen. 

All the food provided was the best I've had on a plane, the flight attendants keep your glass topped up whenever you ask for a refill, and make sure you are well hydrated.

If they don’t allocate a fare for the same fare class, then it’s hard for them to be available!  The only option is to increase the fare by AUD5000 for a change to one leg of a return flight.

2595,"Family visit to Perth with stopover in Singapore Singapore is always my first choice, the A380 has a little more room than the 7 series we flew from Singapore to Perth, the flight from London to Singapore we chose the seats near a door for leg room, glad we did, the only slight setback is people standing waiting for the loo. The food and flight staff I think are excellent, getting a drink was no trouble although I feel awkward pressing the attendant call button so did not use it, the flight between Singapore and Perth was quite tight and when the person in front put the seat back was sort of pined think next time will pay extra and see what the premium economy is like. Being a mechanical engineer the 7 series had wheel bearing noise and the wheel legs were old and very noisy under wing, showing the age of the plane and the workouts done still amazing how smooth the flight was hardly any turbulence. Saving for our next trip but won’t be next year, so my only criticism is our kris flyer points are a waste and was not automatically added to my account so really a waste unless you are a frequent flyer let’s face it if you ca afford to fly often won’t be using economy.",positive

1929,"Please share the meal service menu card? I have been flying Singapore Airlines for over 22 years as  regular frequent flyer. I have been at the top tier Solitaire PPS for a few years before the SQ program changed and my company changed travel policy. Needless to say I have spent many many hours on SQ at all levels of service. My 2 hour flight from Singapore to Bangkok on this day was nothing different. On time departure, a clean aircraft, good service and comfortable seats. What I have come to expect from SQ. However, I experienced something new on this flight and have not seen it again since. During meal service the cabin crew passed around a shared menu card for all of us to use across our row. How odd? The 2 meal selections were highlighted and explained with pictures. Just out of curiosity, I asked about this menu card because I had never seen it before and was told by the crew member it was only for shorter flights. I took a picture of the menu card and the crew member seemed a bit offended by that. I thought nothing more about it until after the meal service I was approached by the Flight Director and he asked me why i had taken a picture of the menu card. He made me feel as though I had committed an offence. It was a real issue with him. He made me very uncomfortable with this manner of approach in front of other passengers. I explained my reasons for taking the photo because I had never seen it before I I found it an odd thing for Singapore Airlines to do. To be honest, as I explained to the FD, this was not what I expected from a world class, award winning airline - my preferred airline. Anyway, this interest by the FD about why I had taken the photo made the menu card even more of an unusual experience. The FD provided the standard reply and that was the end of it. I am waiting to see if I am ever presented with the shared dinner menu again.",positive

The complaints all come from the company itself. It used to be a luxury airline to fly with. Now they have gone the same way as British Airways and become a disappointment. 
No over-ear head phones, just little cheap buds that are difficult to hear with. The food is really cheap and bad.
Boarding happens from only the front of the plane. They let business board, then after a few minutes they let economy board walking straight passed their not so private business seats.

I highly suggest avoiding Singapore Airways now and take a cheaper flight.",negative

Boarding was quick and easy and we had plenty of room in the seat. The seats were WIDE...:) Service on-board was first class. I love the a380 aircraft, so spacious and QUIET. They set the table for you for every meal, there was soo much delicious food, probably too much! Definitely recommend Singapore Air business class. Hope I can fly business again some time soon!

Staff are super friendly and helpful and the planes are always clean and in good repair, as they should. Probably costs a little more for the privilege, but you do get more bang for your buck when it comes to in flight entertainment , meals and service.This flight did tick off one of my bucket list items, I had always wanted to fly in a A380.

The check-in was efficient and the lounge was quite good both sides. However the Singapore to New Delhi was not very good by most standards. I just felt the flight crew were not particularly interested. I quite like the new Singapore airlines seat configuration. I would have given this an excellent all-round except for this one sector. I've normally found in Asia to New Delhi flights can be lacking and wanting with normally older planes being used and the staff being less than caring compared to the Singapore -Brisbane and Brisbane- Singapore flights. These latter segments are exceptionally good. Interestingly there was not much vegetarian options available which is a bit new. In particular would like to commend Mr Anthony Pek Pek Siong for exceptional service as the purser.

I remember when it was first introduced around 10 years ago but it has never made sense.  Crew have to set it up and undo it, it's hard and not long enough for someone of 195cm. I see that SQ are replacing it progressively with the more conventional format. This flight includes a very old plane which is quite worn so it may be one of the last to update alas.  But crew service helped to make up. So caring.",positive
8795,Really disappointed I paid exact money to get more leg room etc for this class but it was terrible. Compared to Canadian Airlines I would never go Singapore again. Please be aware of what you pay for. The seating was old service was average.Just so disappointed.,negative
6013,"Crew Reply Slow I took the SQ flight from Changi to Melbourne. While in the plane, I lited the icon and request for an additional immigration form. It took about half an hour to see one of the crew. 
While on my way back to Singapore. 5-6 children keep on crying all way long about 7 hours. Well, I have to understand though the sound really irritating. The on board meal I preferred which was fish was ran out. So I had to take another choice which was Nasi Briyani. I found that it was full of scallion topping and I don’t eat scallion. I am so happy that the crew made fast change to another beef noodle to me.",neutral

6060,"Singapore Airlines? NEVER AGAIN We were excited at the prospect of flying Business Class. We departed LHR at 9.20AM and an hour later offered ""Brunch"". as we had breakfast in the lounge we were not ready for this ""meal"". About 12.30 we asked for some snacks etc and were informed there was no food available and we would get a meal an hour and a half out of Singapore. There was no drinks cart, no water unless we asked and no tea or coffee!!! this 13 hour flight with little drink or food, we were utterly disgusted.. For this we paid $6500 each. Never again. Be warned. The same scenario happened on the Singapore to Brisbane leg, however this trip not as long, but service or rather lack of was the same. So, best airline, i do not think so.!!!!! 
I need to add that upon return I asked for a refund of the difference between Business and Economy this refused and after much writing and eventually contacting the CEO we were given  a cashcard each of $350. no way enough compensation after paying $12,700.",negative

372,"Damaged Luggage Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. i flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. upon arrival, i notice my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I immediately contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which i sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag i can use for my luggage. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres absolutely no regard for this. I will definitely not be flying with Singapore airlines again because of this poor service. The disregard is unbelievable. i will also be informing my company and other companies in our network to not use Singapore airlines for any of our staff going forward. I never expected this type of service from what i thought was a reputable company

Thank you",negative
1260,"Singapore Airlines 787-10 economy the Singapore Airlines 787-10 economy is  modern quiet comfortable aircraft with only 2 classes. Business and economy. On this trip I flew economy and the cabin is in a 3-3-3 layout 2 isle layout. Being a Gold member with an affiliate airline I was able to use the business check in and I had priority boarding.

The economy seats are designed by RECARO and have a six-way adjustable headrest with adjustable wings to provide more neck support. However teh seats themselves are a tad narrower than the same design which you will find on the A350-900 and the newer A380's.  Power sockets can also be found in-between the seats, and in the back of the seat in front of you there is also a folding table a new updated IFE system and a USB port and a cup holder for your drinks.

The aircraft a modern and the Dreamliner offers a very quiet inflight experience and Singapore Airlines as usual offer very good in flight cabin service.

I would recommend their economy product as its comfortable and clean and  it was an enjoyable experience

Economy seats are getting smaller (is that possible?). We were fortunate to be surrounded by very considerate passengers who only partially inclined their seats so the longest leg (5 1/2 hours) was comfortable enough. Check in and boarding at Hanoi end was a bit chaotic. Our only complaint is the ground staff when departing Perth who didn't know the rules for carrying liquids in hand luggage and insisted we check a bag in. She was adamant that she was right and refused to check for us. We didn't hold our ground because we didn't want to hold up other passengers. We checked with Singapore later and she was wrong!",positive

5373,"Most terrible flight I have flown with Singapore Airlines before and was happy with the service, but my last experience with them was most disappointing. The plain was full, except for one row where the captain was sleeping for the entire flight. My husband had a seat which appears to have added on, as it was halfway on the ile towards premium economy and his legs created a blockage/hinderance for the flight attendance walking past. He further had no screen being half in the ile. Food option ran out on each meal, with no choice for us. We were under the impression to have a direct flight to Cape Town as the booking stated, however the was a stop-over in Johannesburg, where however we were not permitted to disembark to stretch our legs or freshen up in the airport toilets. We had to remain on our seats for passport checks, unable to us the plane toilet facilities or being offered refreshment. Further a cleaning crew enter the plain for cleaning, adding to the unpleasant stop-over. It did not make sense as to why the aircraft was cleaned as no new passengers embarked during this stop-over in Johannesburg.

The flight attendants were very approachable and willing to do anything to make the flight more comfortable and enjoying. On arrival in Singapore I had what I thought was plenty of time to change to the departure terminal for the London leg only to find the 1 hour 30 mins was only just enough. As an elderly person I d0 not walk very fast so it was a tight squeeze to reach the departure terminal on time. The flight to London was comfortable, although I did have a business class seat so was able to lie down and get some sleep. Very comfortable. Only thing I can fault was Singapore airlines do not provide pyjamas, although this was overcome by bringing a very light track suit. The food was amazing as I used the “book the cook” option and ordered Lobster thermidor and a sushi bowl that was very tasty and decent sized portions.

Crew aboard all the flights were wonderful:  always smiling, super efficient, willing to please, and calling me by my name.

Extremely impressed that they could serve a full dinner during the short flight between SIN & PEN; it didn't feel rushed at all. Very good selection of movies and TV. Seat was comfortable, although the need to change the setup between seat and bed is a little awkward.  Also, the table is right where the armrest should be, so my elbow kept on popping up the table.

The only negative element was the agent at Penang airport.  Not knowledgeable, kept challenging my checking in case of wine.  Also, no longer keep fresh orchids in bathrooms (plastic on one flight, none on others).",positive

4004,"Definitely NOT the best! A big risk of time. Qatar Airways is much better!!! I was flying Singapore Airlines from San Francisco to Hyderabad via Singapore and Delhi. The service in the San Francisco to Singapore flight was okay, but I was overly bored in the 18-hour flight. I recommend not flying Singapore Airlines to India since it is a risk of time. Adding a Stopover in Hong Kong  and Delhi was very expensive for me. 18-24 hours to get to Singapore from USA, 2-10 hours of layover in Singapore, and 5 hours to India! I will never fly with Singapore Airlines to India ever again! I will hopefully only fly it to the Singapore City or somewhere in East Asia! 

I wasted an additional $1000 just to be safe from Silkair 737 MAX from Singapore to Hyderabad but my flight Ai383 got canceled again! I also hated Silkair when I went on it and it was very terrible like the last review I wrote! I felt scared in the flight! 

The next time I go to India, I will use Air India non-stop from San Francisco to Delhi to Hyderabad,

Qatar Airways was absolutely better. Last year in July I flew it from LAX to Doha to Hyderabad. It’s service was much better, it’s time was absolutely shorter. It was smoother as silk than Singapore Airlines. It’s Boeing 787 Dreamliners we’re absolutely better than Silkair 737 MAX and Singapore A350 (which everything was OK except it was a giant risk of time), I think other airlines like Air India, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Lufthansa, British, KLM, United, and everything else I flew are absolutely better than Singapore Airlines and Silkair!

198,"Bad experience - beware if you have dietary needs had previously flown with Singapore Airlines and had a positive experience, so I booked again. I have been extremely (!!!) disappointed. 

I do not recommend flying Singapore Airlines if you have any dietary intolerances, requirements or allergies. Before flying: (1) I requested a gluten intolerant meal; (2) I contacted Singapore Airlines through the app; and (3) I also checked that I was all sorted for gluten free upon checking in at Sydney Airport. 

Despite the staff member at the airport providing confirmation, the staff on the second flight (from Singapore to Paris) told me that they had no gluten intolerant meal for me onboard or any record of the request. I then went 13 hours without any substantial food, as I had only brought muesli bars with me (between the initial flight of 8 hours and then a 13 hour layover, I couldn’t bring much else). The stewards offered me a vegetarian meal as an alternative, but this had barley etc (so not suitable). 

The crew onboard and at the airport were both very nice, so that is the only plus I would give to Singapore Airlines. I felt like they were pleasant and tried to make the experience better. However, when contacting Singapore Airlines via phone some weeks before to enquire about re-routing my flight, I had to wait on hold for quite a long time when I just wanted confirmation as to whether I could change the flight at all. It turns out that they have to manually calculate re-routing the flights, which is fair - however, I kept just asking for them to confirm whether it could be done and couldn’t seem to get a simple answer. 

In my subjective opinion, I felt that the seats were more uncomfortable than other similar airlines. The gentleman in front of me on the second flight put his seat right back, so the steward assisted me to find a temporary new seat which was kind of him. Again, the staff at check-in and onboard were lovely and the only plus I would give to the airline. 

I have since contacted Singapore Airlines about the experience and got a very generic short email noting their  sincere apologies and a query about whether I needed to select gluten free on the flight back. I replied in more detail, and have since received a reply addressed to somebody completely different (definitely not me - a completely different surname) saying that they already booked a gluten intolerant meal for my inbound flight (which is contrary to their previous email). 

I would never personally book with Singapore Airlines again and am absolutely dreading the flight back.",negative

However, on the day of departure the check-in was smooth and the counter staff member very polite, efficient and obliging.
Boarding was smooth and hassle-free and the cabin staff bright, helpful, full of smiles and efficient.

I took the time to write to Singapore Airlines on July 6th 2019, plus several follow up e-mails. I believe I gave ample information, so a speedy investigation could be carried out. Today is August 23rd 2019, and I’ve only received correspondence from Singapore Airlines which informs me that my complaint has been forward to Public Affairs. This is now approximately 30 plus working days Singapore has had my complaint and not even sent an e-mail asking if I’m fully recovered. Therefore I’m just bewildered and amazed how this airline operates.",negative
1946,"ALWAYS my first choice! Having lived and traveled in Singapore and other Asian countries, I've done a lot of flying. Though our first-ever Singapore Airlines experience 40+ years ago wasn't great (too much free alcohol to a soccer team on board!), I've never again been in any disappointed with SIA. If the airfare is no more than $100 more to fly Singapore Airlines, I'll willingly pay the difference.

The cabin crew is invariably friendly and polite. Very courteous. They don't talk down to you, but rather kneel to be looking up at you if they stop to visit a bit. 

As airline seats go, the SIA seats are pretty decent. Blankets and pillows add to the comfort. And cleanliness of the aisles and bathrooms is as good as airlines get.

Airline food certainly isn't restaurant food, but it is as good as I've ever had onboard. Whether I request Asian vegetarian or Indian vegetarian, the Singaporeans know how to cook it.

And the prize at the end of the journey is the beauty of Changi Airport and the enchantment of Singapore as a whole.",positive
4131,"Perfect Service The flight started with an uncomplicated check in and a good service on board.

6936,"SQ 242 Singapore Air - Always a great way to fly I've always wished fellow travellers would post menus of flights they were on so they know what to expect beforehand... I suppose here is a great way to contribute!

Singapore Airlines is always a great way to fly、no doubt about that. Of course the flight experience differs each time、depending on the crew、the menu、the entertainment etc.

I must say I really enjoyed the flight back from Sydney. The stewardess on my aisle was extra warm and friendly and recommended me (and the passenger beside me whom I don't know personally) champagne, although both of us were ordering juice or something initially. It might sound a little shallow, but service staff could just do what they are told (which would be robotic) but it takes effort to engage with their customers/passengers and suggest something. So I really appreciated that. I pre-ordered the ""Book The Cook"" from Singapore Airlines' website... for those who are wondering what is on the menu for SQ242 (and the corresponding flight SIN-SYD), photos are attached. Enjoy!!",positive
261,"Avoid using Singapore airline or transit through Changi We used SQ  875 from Hong Kong to Singapore for transit  and SQ 964 from Singapore to CGK international airport in Indonesia, This is used to be the best Airlines. First of all it was delayed for 3 hours at the Hong Kong Airport with no air conditions in the mid of Summer in Hong Kong. The AC was on after the plan started to move. This delayed cause us to missed our connecting flight in Singapore. Arrive in Hong Kong again we had to wait inside the airplane for 45 minutes due to technical problems again with no air conditions. Now because of that we are booked on the next flight in which of course being 2 hours late, it is a good thing that are in side Changi Airport. The airport is not that great like people saying. Hong Kong new airport and Doha international airport is way better than Changi. I have to tell you about this airport too. Now after being 2 hours late they told us to go to Gate 69 in which we wait patiently with the other passenger and crew. Long behold on the boarding time, a staff came and spoke to the crew and the crew announced that the gate was changed to Gate 29. That is a 40 mins walked with no official announcement. By the way at Gate 29 it will still say SQ  964 and the official airport announcement  board is still on Gate 69. This is the worst airlines experience that we had, this is way worst than Lion Air or Pakistan International Air. Singapore Airlines make these airlines looks way better. So we cancelled our return flight and only got 50% back after all of the fine, currency exchange etc even though we cancelled it 3 weeks before our returned flight. I recommended Avoid using Singapore Airlines at all cost. We changed to Cathay Air from CGK to HK and its a very nice experience with cheaper ticket price with a wonderful crew and better meal. Again Do Not use this airlines, you will regret it.",negative

To this day, 5 months later, Singaporeair has not responded to my claim for reimbursement. No more Singaporeair. Spent a lot of money on flights, very shabby service.

3843,Vaping in Singapore/Changi Airport As an avid vapour I was worried about what to do once hitting Changi Airport as vaping is prohibited in Singapore.  So here is how it works.  I traveled from Auckland to Vietnam with a transit stop in Singapore for 3 hours and was panicking about my vape which was in my checked in baggage. This was not an issue but my plans had me coming back to Singapore for 3 days later in my travels - here's what I found out. While transiting you can carry your vape and use the smoking areas in the international terminals as long as you do not go through immigration.  On my return to Singapore 2 weeks later I was going through immigration/customs so you can put your vape into baggage storage BEFORE going through immigration - in terminal 2 the baggage storage is behind Prada right beside the immigration gate and there is storage in every terminal.  When I flew out I was going out of terminal 3 so I went through immigration at T2 picked up my stuff and headed over to T3 - easy peezy.  You will either need to smoke cigarettes or use patches while in Singapore - I used nicotine lozenges which were no issue at all through customs.  I was there late August 2019.  Happy vaping...,positive

9184,"Travel if you wanna know what is likely to fly with best airline in the World I would like to share my feedback on my recent & first trip With SQ. and why i choose to fly with SQ

As per business need in my current  organisation all ""C"" level need  to travel frequently so with our corporate travel agent i book SQ as they ""Preferred"" & from my other team who has ever traveled with SQ they always says It's THE BEST!

So I thought personally why not to feel it and see what’s make it best so i discovered promotion at SQ site and decided that's it’s the time where i need to experience, in-spite of  long flight i thought i will have more time to explore so I flew. So I travel from Delhi to Bangkok via Singapore and vice versa.

Amazing experience overall and what I have heard mostly ""Great food"" indeed it is  and it exceeded my expectations Hindu meal- Non Veg- Best food I have ever had, best in class entertainment options ( i like specially Hindi movies collection from Asain part) although SQ 401 seems  a bit outdated to me looking  at entertainment options however even though all looks good to me, in lavatory all amenities were perfectly placed majorly i have seen everything and mostly i found clean and tidy too.

SQ 978 which we boarded from Singapore to Bangkok was again perfect, cabin crew is happy to help you for everything that one need, i have to mentioned because economy class at times been treated secondary which i didnt felt while travelling with SQ.

when I was travelling from Bangkok to Singapore- SQ 975 as seat was not getting adjusted I thought it’s non recliner but flight attended tried to adjust and informed its recliner seat and i was in forward seat zone not sure name Sarifash ( maybe) offered with great smile in case I would like to shift as it was short flight I didn’t wish to move but i could feel empathy! and that's what matter.

what i love the most is Airbus 380- 800 SQ 406 while i travailed from Singapore to New Delhi, huge aircraft and i choose to be at upper Deck which was good idea.

Meals were served hot all the time and if one has order any special meal they serve first to them then anyone. They kept us servicing water/Drinks so good in case one has long flight.

Staff make sure that everyone get equal attention and they nailed it, if one starts travelling with Singapore Airlines would choose only to fly with SQ because it's The best!",positive

The A350 is a superior aircraft in comfort compared to B787. I particularly liked the seat recline, seat as well as back moves, thus avoiding a pet dislike,i.e. the passenger who reclines seat back so far that there is no room to get in & out.

4888,"Very comfortable, well serviced flight We travelled Economy from Melbourne to Amsterdam via Singapore and return from Zurich to Melbourne in June. We found the both the check-in staff and the cabin crew very attentive and friendly, we enjoyed the food selections and the movie menu and as we are both short, leg room was ample for us. All announcements were clear and toilets were clean. The blankets were large and warm and the pillows very comfortable. We were given a small travel pack containing socks and a toothbrush 
& paste on the way over but this was not handed out on our return flight 6 weeks later. The only problem we encountered was finding our way to a different terminal in Singapore's enormous airport with very little time to do so. On our return journey this was exacerbated when the plane was late to arrive in Singapore leaving us with 10 minutes by the time we disembarked to catch our forwarding flight in the same terminal, then to find out (only because we couldn't see our flight on the board) that forwarding flight was leaving from another terminal. Our race to firstly catch the train, then run to the departure lounge totally stressed our senior bodies to the limit. When we arrived we were informed that the flight had been delayed for an hour and we were told to take a seat and settle our heart rates. Communication was extremely poor in our case and had the potential to cause a health problem.",positive
4338,"Excellent in every aspect. We have flown with Singapore Airlines for many years which in itself is an acknowledgement of their excellent service. On this recent trip we flew five legs with the airline and in all cases their service was exemplary. The cabins are always well maintained, especially the toilets where staff regularly ensure that they are clean and well stocked. We had an issue at one airport where we needed to ensure that our luggage was leaving on the same flight as ourselves; Singapore Airline staff were quickly onto the task of confirming this and once they received confirmation they sought me out even though I had committed to calling into the Departure counter to check. The other great advantage of flying with Singapore Airlines is that we land in Singapore and make use of a stopover for a few days to get ourselves back into the time zone after travelling to Europe. Going through Changi Airport is always a  pleasure rather than a chore. Highly recommended.",positive

There was no confirmation sent by Singapore Airlines to Scoot so our names were nonexistent on the flight. We were told by staff that nothing could be done from their end. Two and half hours sitting at the service desk, while reading signs saying it was already overbooked made us realize there was no chance we could return home to Australia as planned. Pulling our hair out and going around in circles calling every possible company (Singapore used Scoot who then used silk airlines all of which are affiliated with one another). We got to Singapore to be laughed at in transfer D and told go online at terminal C, when informed to lodge a formal complaint when we arrived at Singapore.

4104,"Spacious Refitted 777-200 but some wear & tear visible. Terminal 2 Silverkris Lounge
- Spacious and much quieter lounge than the one in Terminal 3.
- Food offering wise, quite standard nothing wow or feels a bit premium. Even the temporary Gold Lounge at T3 for economy class passengers food offering seems better: There's satay.
- I was there in between breakfast and lunch, hence the quite normal fare. 

Aircraft General Feel and Comments
- This is a refitted 777-200 aircraft with some of the older products. 
- Plus point, the seat is very spacious and in a 1-2-1 layout. For short-haul not an issue, for medium-long haul, read from some reviews that people don't like it as the seat is very hard and not very comfortable for sleeping. 
- As it is an older aircraft, plus there has been several versions of business class seats since this one, hence, some wear and tear around the seat, carpet, even shelves in toilets can be seen. 

Food & Beverage
- Very average and normal starter.
- Main course selected book the cook: Japanese char-grilled soya beef. Taste is good and but not wow. Probably will not choose again. 
- Bread feels soggy, had the garlic bread. Last flight from Sydney was warm and crisp. 

Service
- Pretty standard SQ service. Again, was good but not wow. 
- The aunties at the lounge was much nicer and friendlier. 

Economy class wasn't full too, perhaps next time should book economy since this is such a short flight.",positive

2862,Only average I usually take emirates when I fly. but decided to take Singapore airlines for once to try it out with all the great reviews. I felt that the inflight entertainment was quite limiting and difficult to navigate only a small selection of new films compared to loads of old and new alike on emirates. But I would say that I enjoyed having a full HD display. I would say that the crew were above average in the terms of service and gave a hot towel before the flight which was a bit too warm for me. The food was way to salty and had only a western and Chinese options without any curry option as I guess they assume that only people whom order a halal meal like curry.  For some reason they would not let me charge my phone during take off and landing. I feel that this airline is not worth the extra money over emirates. I feel some of the good reviews of this airline are from Singaporeans whom pledge loyalty to the national airline without trying out the competition,neutral
399,"Disappointing After flying a few times with Singapore Economy Class I decided to splurge and try Business Class, but I was disappointed for one main reason: I remember the slogan for Singapore Airlines used to be, 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', and this is one of the rare cases of 'truth' in advertising and one of the main selling points and points of difference for Singapore airlines. But obviously, this slogan is not very PC or woke, and is no longer used because of those reasons; but that does not mean it isn't true or effective marketing. But worse than that, the Business class cabin was staffed by way too many male flight attendants; and even worse, the 'team leader' for all the flight attendants on all Singapore Airlines fights I have experienced (business and economy) was a man! So, Singapore Airlines have gone from 'Singapore Girl, you're a great way to fly!', to way too many male flight attendants and not even a Singapore girl or woman being the the boss of the inflight cabin crew! That is extremely stupid and disappointing! For Singapore Airlines to relinquish one of the best and most truthful slogans in airline marketing history because of woke or otherwise pressure is political correctness and 'equal opportunity' gone mad! Isn't it funny that for years women strive for equal opportunity to no avail, but when whining men cry for the same it is instantly realised to the detriment of everybody, including an airline's effective marketing slogan. The vocation of flight attendant is a 'care' vocation, like a tour guide, like child care, like elderly care, men should not do it. I will avoid Singapore Airlines in the future for this very reason: 'Singapore 'Man', you're NOT a great way to fly.",neutral

The service on board was excellant with all the personnel using your name. they were very attentaive and nothing was a problem. In relation to food we used the 'book the cook' which was excellant and had Lobster Thermidor for one meal followed by a lovely steak for the next. Would recommend using this service.

They offered me SGD 250 per person compensation and also business class tickets for China eastern airlines to reach shanghai directly. The only issue that I faced was to wait at the airport as the flight that they offered was after 4 hours, but they sent me to the airport lounge.

5711,"Worst Premium Economy seat on Singapore Airlines Seat 32H in Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines A380-800 is terrible. Firstly, seats 31H and K have no luggage space at all. If the occupants of these seats are onboard before those sitting in 32H and K they use the space above row 32 which leaves no space for row 32. However, the bigger issue is that adjacent to seat 32H is a cabinet used to store various sundry items used by cabin staff. The problem with this is that cabin staff access this cabinet constantly throughout the flight and every time they do they inconvenience the occupant of seat 32H. Each time cabin staff access the cabinet they tend to stick their bottom in the face of the occupant of 32H. Further, each time they access the cabinet they make a noise locking and unlocking the doors and consistently disturbing and/or waking the occupant of seat 32H. This is extremely poor design. Also, about 2 metres in front of row 32 is an area where cabin staff congregate for no other apparent reason but to have a chat. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines around 20 times in the last 2 years and have had a good experience each time but save your money and fly Economy class or make sure you avoid seat 32H at all costs in the Singapore Airlines A380-800.",negative
59,"Generally a high standard In the bigger scheme of things among all airlines, it provides a high level of service and offers a good product, though not outstanding. Staff service was professional and efficient but somewhat lacking in genuineness. Service, especially on the outbound, was very rushed. For example, the pre-departure hot towel was given and taken away before I could even touch it. Cabin crew can best be described as highly efficient but perfunctory. There is a high degree of helpfulness but also kind of stern. Seating was the same kind for inbound and outbound even though they were on different types of aircraft (B787 and A350). One is lucky to get flat-bed seating on a regional flight, but the seat is just uncomfortable, too narrow, and the head “wing” gets in the way and blocks the view from the window. The 3-point seatbelt was also uncomfortable. Food on the outbound was awful, even when it’s from “book the cook”. The duck was dry and pathetic looking, and tasted like it looked. On the inbound, the fish dish was excellent and succulent. I wonder if it’s from the Bangkok kitchen rather than from the Singapore kitchen. Beverages were good, with Piper Heidsieck champagne and a very good port, though the pre-takeoff champagne was served warm. There was strangely no beverage menu -- only a food menu with wine list. For the Singapore lounges, Terminal 3 lounge is renovated and expanded, and world class. Terminal 2 lounge is dated and in need of a revamp. The main issue with the Singapore lounges is the food – only mediocre local food is served. It is a real shame that there is no Western food, or other kinds of Asian cuisine such as Japanese and Middle Eastern. Singapore is not known for tasty food or fine cuisine, and the lounge food clearly reflects this. The lounge wines were very good, however; especially the 2 kinds of white. Lounge staff were rather surly. The Bangkok lounge was good enough for its purpose of being an outstation lounge. It has enough quantity and variety of seating and adequate F & B, though there are no showers. F & B on the whole – both on board and in the lounge – was one level below that of Qatar, though Singapore has better consistency in the various other aspects. Online check-in was very smooth and painless. You need not go to a counter nor get a paper boarding pass.

The lady I spoke to told me I couldn't use my 31,000 points, I would have to use them later and there was no way I could make the booking and use the points.  This went on for 45 minutes so I asked to speak to her supervisor , which took another 12 minutes of waiting and sounded remarkably like the same person.  
I asked if we could split the flights up so that we could use the points for the Singapore airlines flights, and then book our Lufthansa section separately.  She eventually agreed to this and then pointed out that our 31,000 points were worth a little over $300 and there would be a separate surcharge for each booking as we doing them through the phone and that she couldn't guarantee my husband and I would be able to sit together.

Over a 21 hour period, there were many opportunities to impress us with the food served. Singapore Airlines menu sounded tasty, elaborate even, but in reality we just didn’t enjoy much of it at all. Difficult to explain why we felt disappointed but each course just didn’t taste very good. The quality and flavour just wasn’t there. It reached a point where we gave up expecting anything decent to eat and turned down a few meals even though we were hungry. We left the plane more or less ravenous! The film choices were very poor.

2344,"Very Disappointed  My onwards flight to Vegas was quite good as I was given the emergency seats as I’m 6’3” in height. The meals were quite good but was disappointed by the selection of movies on the flights on the 30th of November from Colombo to Singapore and then from Singapore to San Francisco. The service also was definitely not the typical Singapore airlines standard that I have experienced in the past. The call for assistance was missed several times. 

On my return journey on the 8th of December via Los Angeles to Singapore and Colombo it was a more than 20hr light and was extremely disappointing. First I couldn’t get the emergency exit seats despite I felt that it could have been done at Narita. Further the real issue was the seat I had 42D was broken and couldn’t recline. I suffered so much due to this. It was so hard given the length of the flight. They did offer me a middle seat but thag would have made matters worse. I feel given that I had a decent amount of Krysflyer points I think they could have easily upgraded me to business class given the situation of the chair and my height. It was a terrible flight due to this and once again it wasn’t at all the typical SIA flights that I have experienced in the past. The food was also not that great and once again the service was not at all what I expected. In fact for the first time I thought that Qatar Airways service was much better compared to my last trip with them.  
The boarding process on both legs was very professional and done well.",negative
1282,Refund related issue I wish i could give them a 0 star ..because of covid flights got canceld i called them to give me refund me they refunded me but after few days back they again charged me near about $400 dollars i send them my bank statements they guys are looking at total puchases instead of SingaporeAir,negative

2704,"Only slightly better than our outward flight but not satisfying Our outward flight was alredy disappointing. So we decreased our expectations and anticipation to that business flight. Friendlyness of staff was marginally better, but service was still chaotic. E.g. I got my braekfast (simple continental with OJ, coffee, croissant) over 30' and just because I asked 3 times (e.g. OJ received when almost in Zürich...). And my wife beside me had have breakfast a long time ago when I begann to receive tablecloth already (recommendation to Singapore Airline: Emirates is capable to serve couples simutaniously even when served from separate corridor). I still had my issue with to less space for laying (feet on the left of my seat in front of me, only laying on one side possible - call it croissant-position). But this flight shocked me mostly du to condition of furniture. Shaky stuff, jammed seat and even missing furniture parts!! And that in the ""new A380 setting"" Pretty bad condition for ""new""",neutral
5467,"Brilliant Staff & Airline Spoke to girls in Brisbane they were brilliant Charlotte & Georgie catered to all our requirements we needed to have a return flight from Brisbane/London, however we were cruising from Singapore to London. Another company we have been with for many years wanted to book 2 one way flights.Singapore made it return without the Singapore to London leg with a substantial saving to us.They booked us on extra legroom to Singapore then Premium Economy home.
We could not fault their service. The staff on board each flight were also fantastic nothing was too hard. Overall a brilliant trip.",positive

3728,"Disappointing for SQ Flew Premium Economy fm FCO to MEL via SIN. Flight No’s : SQ365 A350-900, SQ217 A380. 
Overall SQ Prem Y class is okay but that’s reflective of SQ pricing which is quite reasonable of this quality airline. Basically the extra $ you pay for is just for the bigger seat. The service is very much still Economy. SQ is known for its excellent cabin crew and service levels in all classes , however this was not evident in premium economy cabin on either flights. Believe Economy crew were responsible for Premium Economy cabin and as Economy was quite busy the premium cabin felt “forgotten about “. Food & drinks was very much Economy class, except in FCO they served a complimentary champagne after take off (but only one glass per pax, when I asked for another glass the crew simply forgot it and when enquiring about it with meal service , they said they could not serve it now only at take off?!) 
Curtains couldn’t be drawn as premium cabin uses Economy bathrooms so again gave it a more Economy feel than premium. 
Overall - good price for bigger seat , but don’t expect famous SQ service levels everyone talks about. If you want the big seat with all the bells and whistles - fly CX or QF (but note the price increase)!
My advice to SQ - appoint dedicated cabin crew to Premium Economy cabin will surely improve the service and feel of this class.",neutral

9985,"Confusing and misleading website As a KrisFlyer Member and loyal customer booking flights online used to be a breeze.
Not anymore. On the first page you choose the flight to your destination at the advertised prize then on the second page book your return only to find out that your booking class is no more available and one is forced to pay considerably more. To make matters worse you have to pay extra for a reserved seat, pay some more for a ""forward seat"" and baggage allowance for the return leg might differ too. All very confusing and misleading.
Overall the website resembles more and more a ""el cheapo"" budget airline.
Service on board has been cut too - no more snacks and refreshments before the main meal, asking for water results in a sip out out of plastic cup - what about a 500ml water bottle available in Thailand for 20 cents.
It seems obvious that the bean counters are now in charge at headquarters",negative

3827,"got well and truly stuffed by this airline i guess i expected better, noticed on flightradar24 the flight was already down as delayed ( 5pm flight saw the delayed at 10am that morning)  i had a 75 minute change over at Changi. when i approach the staff they had already had options for me to go either via Perth or melbourne chose via melbourne , originally i had paid extra money for a exit row seat on the aisle only to be dumped at the back of the plane on a window ( no mention from them to reimburse for the paid good seat) get to melbourne go to Qantas to checkin , sorry we cannot help you they have not ticketed the booking we cannot help go upstairs and fine the Admin room, after half an hour they put me on a virgin flight. 
 A few things that upset me most i asked for a print out from Chiang Mai staff for the Qantas booking ( yes yes thats all you need) i get to the transfer station at Changi yes yes all fine  all booked just check in at Qantas in melbourne . Why did no one pick up the error , nothing worse than being stuff around and after a Sh..t trip i am told nothing confirmed sort it out yourself !!

4835,"Unacceptable treatment  My husband and I had selected seats together on our return flight from HK. We were informed by email that there was a change in carrier and our seats were changed separating us. We tried to make changes immediately on the system and the changes were accepted. However, on the actual day when we checked in at the airport express we were told that our seats has been reverted to separate seats.    Reasons given change in carrier and flight is full.  One would have thought that such a renown brand like Singapore Airlines would have the resource to apply data analytics to understand its passengers profile such that passengers travelling together will not inadvertently be separated due to a change in carrier. This was really an unacceptable treatment and disappointing experience.",neutral
8206,Really good experience on board We took a morning flight out of Manila to Singapore in November on board their B787. We have to say that the experience was a lot better than their B777s.

It was a very pleasant morning flight.,positive
8925,The best flying experience I've ever had My wife and I were very well looked after by our cabin crew including CS Faruku and Mok Kai Yee who catered for our every need.

7442,"Ok but no ‘Wow’ experience We flew by SIA because it enabled us to fly to Tokyo and depart from Osaka. And it was a direct flight which we preferred. The experience was average where staff were courteous and polite. Food wise was average too. We did not experience any ‘wow’ moments e.g., additional  ice creams being served as we heard from other people’s experience. 
My entertainment system didn’t work on the flight back even after the air stewardess helped to reset the system. It was a boring flight back for me. The Singapore local special meal (fried bee noon) was a disgrace as It didn’t taste nice at all.
 Nonetheless, the flight was smooth and landing was great. We probably had higher expectations from this airline because it was SIA and the fare was not cheap. We were also surprised to have to pay extra for seat selection prior to check in (similar to budget airline)",neutral

2205,"Awesome experience So had booked premium economy with Air NZ to Singapore return but changes to flights meant we swapped to Singapore on the way back. We were happy with that to compare premium economy as this was our first time on this class. Arrived in Singapore Changi at our gate lounge and were surprised we had to scan our boarding passes to get into the gate. Ours would not scan and we were told to wait to one side while it was sorted. There had been a storm in Singapore which had caused delays (our flight on Silk Air from Phuket had been delayed an hour due to this) so our plane was changed to a Dreamliner which has the full two stories. There was quite a delay with the ticketing but we finally got our boarding passes to find we had been upgraded to business class. Well we were through that boarding lounge and onto the plane like a rat up a drain pipe...! We were blown away by the service and the comfort. The seats are huge, your foot rest too comfy and the lie flat bed was awesome. We both loved the food and especially the little things like the table cloths etc. the staff were wonderful and it was the best end to a great holiday.",positive

367,"No Stars if it was an option Four flights - Brisbane to Singapore to Phuket and return.  Absolutely dreadful experience.  Still have PTSD from the final flight!  Firstly, the food trays in economy are not to be messed with.  They sit so low on the seat in front that when you open them out they sit on your stomach at an angle that allows the food/drinks to slide off.  Also no complimentary packs as was once the case.  I was looking forward to those little slippers they used to give you – nada - but that's ok because the seat in front of you is so close that to bend down to put them on you more than likely would give yourself concussion when your head hits said seat.  It also felt like they had managed to squeeze in another four rows of seats at the expense of comfort and ease for passengers. 

Food on all flights was inedible but the final flight's food (departed Singapore around 12.45 am) was non-existent - nothing was offered except water and juice until approximately 7 am when baked beans and an egg was served.  Who serves baked beans to a plane load of passengers? The toilets are busy enough without the added fibre of a baked bean meal.  Can't complain about the service because there was nothing to serve.  I really felt like I was flying with some sort of budget airline instead of one that I paid quite a bit of money for.  Singapore Airlines once had a fantastic reputation and I was looking forward to flying with them.  I certainly won't be flying with them again.  It’s obviously all about the bottom dollar now and not flying experience for passengers.",negative

- Very friendly staff

5171,"I just don’t get it. What am I missing?  World’s best airline? Not by a very long shot!! I quit flying SQ’s economy products years ago while living in Singapore. It was so often terrible, notably dirty. Most recently I ventured back into their business class to discover their new fit out. I honestly didn’t think I could dislike a plane seat more than their old fold down leather seats which became lumpy and rancid smelling, but alas, at least you had space to stretch while the seat was in its bed configuration. 

The new seat is a regular slide down seat BUT it’s extremely hard and excruciatingly uncomfortable to sleep on. It’s like laying on a wood floor with less than an inch of fabric to provide comfort. Bring back the smelly old leather seats I say! Although on my return flight I got that old fit out on an A380 and it was still stinking like the back of on old man’s car.

A note on cabin crew: I find the so-called SQ girls (and boys) to be extremely insincere and unhelpful. Even in business class, they are slow to respond and barely articulate. The fake and uncomfortable grimacing is upsetting. The Singapore girl on my aisle was trying hurry me into menu choices I didn’t want because she visibly couldn’t be bothered. Worse still, she couldn’t pronounce any of the words correctly, which was ridiculous. Not a matter of accent, but a complete lack of interest. 

Generally speaking, Singapore Airlines is just so tacky. From the ugly old uniforms to the lounges, to the inflight music and the menus, which look like they were typeset in the 1980s using your neighbour’s word processor. Just awful.",negative

Food has dropped in standard and they didnt have the choice many people wanted on all of four flights. They need to learn what meals are popular, it isn't hard, but this seems to be cost-saving they are doing.

The people who pay extra for legroom at the front like me seem to get worst deal being served last, with cold food and no choices.
The food is no longer great, a continental breakfast was six bits of chopped fruit (4 apple) a dry roll and muffin - Thats it.  No cheese, ham, yogurt, cereal,  etc.

9838,"Okay flight , UGH CHECK IN!!  I don’t get it. 

Singapore airlines has some of the nicest inflight entertainment, new fleet of airlines, slightly above average aircrew and okay seats. Why do they have to make the check in experience so horrible ! They have implemented self check in for the past 1.5 years. It’s horrible. The seats are at a higher cost then other airlines. Yet, we have to bend or backs to load our luggage on the conveyor belt, print our tickets. It’s super UGH! A skeleton crew of 5 staff helps you with the check in queries. 

So the message is this, if you take economy or premium economy everything less business or first class be prepare to be treated like a peon! 

By the way the call Centre is horribly outsourced. So god luck if you are calling in to check anything via the phone. Some times the online help doesn’t have the info, yet this is implemented.

3377,"Lifetime experience in suites Well what can I say, Ticking off an item on my bucket list I decided to book 2 legs in First Class with Singapore Airlines and it was an experience that lived up to more than I expected.

Having flown many a time with Singapore in Economy Class, I knew that there was a reason why it is considered to be one of the best airlines in the world.

On this occasion, all the perks that come with flying 1st Class as well as the unbelievable attention given by the staff, was an amazing experience.",positive
6596,Very good service I Cannot fault the service but I would not pay the extra for premium economy. I like to lean against the window to try and get some sleep but in Premium economy the seats are too far away from the wall of the plane. The seats were leather and I was slipping down in the seat so I found it a bit uncomfortable. Returned on normal economy and found it easier to sleep. I would definitely fly with them again the food and the service was very good.,positive

8128,"OK but. The JAL lounge in Osaka was not terrific. The service on the flight was very good but the food was very average. Nice wines though.

The seats were oddly configured and the entertainment system was really old. Could only get a list of movies that were part through and had to scroll through each one. I’ve seen anything like it.

I checked to see if this might be its last flight before being handed back and see that they started handing them back the 10 year old ones in Nov 2017. This one is overdue.

I had been wanting to fly Singapore Airlines for years, but I was never going to the right places. We made a slight detour to do it this year. The plane was an hour late so we missed the SQ flight to Bali and had to stay overnight. They were at the gate with boarding passes for the early flight next day with Silk Air and Crown Plaza tickets, but it made a less than great experience annoying.",positive

The crew came and have a small chat with us and our daughter too. They even asked how was our rest and meal.

They are the best and no-one  come close to standards of Singapore airline, in my opinion.

Krisflyer not good as it cost more money to redeem flights or redeem using their duty free. I would not recommend membership as the blackout dates are so much that you need to use most of your miles to fly economy class and also pay fees and charges when redeeming and I found the cheap tickets to work out better than redemption.",positive
6124,"Excellent long-haul and regional business class Singapore Airlines offered an excellent business class product on both the medium-haul and short-haul legs of my trip from Brisbane to Yangon via Singapore. Brisbane to Singapore 8 hr flight was on their new Airbus A350-900, which offer an excellent all-aisle business class seat (at first I has my doubts about the new seat, which looks very wide but short, but actually its length is comparable to other latest generation seats, while affording much more lateral space, great choice!). Singapore to Yangon was on A330-300 with the regional business class seat (former medium-haul seat), which albeit without 180º recline still becomes fully flat and is very comfortable for the 2.5 hr flight. In both legs the flight crew was extremely attentive, and the Terminal 3 KrisSilver business lounge in Singapore is very good, even if it would be nicer if it had views to the outside of the airport (also, showers in the lounge start to feel a bit tired, and are smaller than the product in other more recently renewed lounges). The food options seemed a bit bland, and I was surprised that no amenity kit was offered even for the 8 hour flight (there were amenities, but they did not come in a kit), but in any case, Singapore Airlines continues to offer an excellent business class travel experience.",positive

While serving drinks and meals she wasnt happy at all. Even upon finishing serving, she just dragged the trolly and hid into a lady seated near me and without even saying sorry and dashed off. Surprised how she climbed up to this very senior position. How do you expect her juniors to behave. Honestly i think she should be pulled and cautioned. Its a disgrace to SIA indeed.",neutral

2430,"Pampered by great service, tasty food choices We took SQ478 from Singapore to Johannesburg on Business Class. The seat was more than roomy, & was definitely comfortable. The handheld set was easy to figure out, so were the seat settings. The restroom was always clean, the toilet paper neatly folded even at 3AM. I've been on many other airlines & the restrooms were not always as well maintained as the ones on this flight. Supplies were always present even on the last hour of the flight. 

The menu had food for different cultures- oriental or western. Food was nicely prepared, & it was a treat to our taste buds. The staff also offered us snacks & hot beverages as we watched movies in the wee hours of the night. It was easy to catch the flight attendant's attention, so I never had to use the call light for assistance. Service was prompt, timely & always given with a smile even at 3 AM. I, too, have worked overnight shifts in the past & to serve with a smile is no easy feat. I requested the flight attendant to make my bed or convert it back to a seat, & she promptly obliged. The flight attendants as a group made us, the customers, feel pampered. 

Entertainment was diversified with so many movies available, as well as TV shows & games. They also had movies in Chinese, Hindi, & other languages. 

The flight left on time & arrived on time. Our luggage was handled fairly well with no dented suitcases. 

I recommend Singapore Airlines. I'd fly with them again whether it's a 12-hour flight or just a 3-hour one. After getting pampered by their flight attendants for hours, one doesn't feel like getting off. Truly the world's best.",positive
478,"Very Disappointing First Class Experience The lounge was disappointing and felt untidy and the food on offer was ok. Boarding was disjointed with me being handed off between three different crew members. The suite was nice but the leather felt dirty. The staff were far too over the top and this did not feel genuine but rather subservient. Feel that other airlines do much better at genuine customer service. SQ needs to review their uniforms as the women’s tops and skirts all looked way too tight and that style is now rather dated. The men’s suits all looked modern in comparison. The Lalique toiletries were lovely. The menu selection was vast and the best part of the entire flight. 
One of my bags was badly damaged. It was brand new and I inadvertently had two photos to prove tgat at the airport the bag was not damaged. I had NOTHING BUT ISSUES with SQ. They insisted I claim this on my travel insurance despite proof that the damage was caused buy them/an agent acting for them. I had staff members be incredibly rude and even lie to me. I have never had such horrific treatment. 
I’d never spend this amount of money with SQ again. In fact, I’ll never fly with them again. SQ staff are substandard.",negative
210,"Standards Dropping - A Mixed Experience Note: This review includes SQ47 (Economy) and SQ422 (which was in Business)

SQ used to be my home airline, and I used to really enjoy flying with them. I was looking forward to experiencing them after the pandemic, and I was left with mixed feelings, being disappointed after the first, and impressed after the second?

My first flight from Vancouver to Singapore, I was waitlisted for an upgrade. However, this caused a problem with my ticket, resulting in about a 30 minute check in process. Additionally, the check-in staff requested my OCI (an Indian overseas citizenship), despite my second flight being on a separate ticket made from a different mileage account, and the check-in staff only checking the bag through to Singapore, as they apparently couldn't see my onward booking. They tried to avoid this question, and while I suspect it was so they could charge us extra in Singapore, since the baggage allowance is different for flights from Singapore to India, I won't make any assumptions.

My initial reaction to the seat was that it definitely felt smaller than the older A350 seats (since I believe these are the same ones used on the 787 with a narrower cabin). I was seated in an extra legroom seat for this flight (48K), which I recommend if you're flying on the A350. It has a window, great legroom, and if you're relatively small, you can also get out into the aisle without disturbing your seatmates.

I have to say, the entertainment system aboard SQ is great. Additionally, as KF members, we had access to unlimited free wifi throughout the flight, which worked great, and which was surprisingly fast. I ended up using it the whole flight. 

The food on this flight was substandard. The first meal was fine, a bit on the small side, but I was OK with it. The second meal, however, was very low quality, and dry. Considering there were only 2 major meal services, I expected something more substantial, and with SQ being named ""Best Airline in the World"", I definitely expected more. Attached with this review is  a picture of a similar meal served on my Emirates flight a few weeks later. 

However, what really disappointed me was the service. One of the crew members working my section was very friendly and warm. However, I witnessed poor service from the other crew members. The other crew seemed to be a bit hostile. When I went to get snacks from the aft galley, the crew members were extremely unfriendly, and seemed quite annoyed when I asked what options were available. Also saw 2 crew on the other side of the cabin screaming at a passenger who went to use the washroom before takeoff (which is completely understandable lol, so I didn't think much of it), but throughout the flight, they seemed to be unfriendly, and later screamed at a passenger seated near me who asked a question about the special assistance they needed disembarking, which is unacceptable behavior. 

Crew are extremely important to any experience, and growing up, I remember the friendly service from crew, and the care they treated children with aboard flights, which really built a strong image of SQ for me. However, I never saw that for the children seated behind me from the majority of the cabin crew, and to me, this shows either a drop in standard, or a lack of training. I have experienced friendlier cabin crew aboard budget airlines like Swoop, which certainly doesn't charge the same as SQ. I've seen poor service on SQ (particularly on flights to the US, including in business class), but this was worse than what I've seen before, and I really hope this is not caused by lack of crew rest, as I noticed the crew working most of the flight.

In Singapore, I have to say Changi cannot be beaten. It was still a very smooth experience, and brought back many childhood memories, not having changed much in 4 years imo. I had access to the lounge on my second flight, and I have to say the new KrisFlyer lounge is great. Good selection of food, and lots of seating.
 
SQs medium haul business is smaller than their LH product, but is still very comfortable. I wish they modified their 787 seats to take advantage of the wider cabin on the A350, in business and economy. The bed is comfortable, and the seat is well designed overall. It's good to see this kind of product on medium haul/short haul flights.

The food on this flight was excellent. Had Laksa from the Book the Cook menu, and it was easily one of the best inflight meals I've had. The service on this flight was very different, much friendlier, and very attentive. All the crew went above and beyond on this flight. Although service standards are higher in business class, I do think the service definitely exceeded what I have experienced in business before. I wish these crew were deployed on the longer flights.

Overall, after the pandemic, I'm left with mixed feelings about the airline. The first flight was very disappointing, nowhere near what my experience with them has been before. However, my second flight was great (although it was in business). This experience has definitely put me off flying SQ, and given my experience with EK this summer, I would definitely fly to India next time using the 3 big gulf carriers over SQ. I hope SQ really takes their service and catering more seriously, as I have been seeing other people complain about dropping standards too.",neutral

836,"Singapore Airlines was always great, what has happened since covid What was so hard was change in flights times at airport where the change was so close to next flight, most of passengers on our previous flight from Copenhagen to Singapore were like us, had to run to get to the gate, go through customs and the lines were so long, all passengers called during the line up. Because of the big rush belongings were left behind my husbands good hat, people had moved it and we missed it (we wrote to Singapore Airlines about this) the worst thing was our Grandson's Epi Pen for his peanut allergy was left on the plane. My daughter had to again run back to the plane to get the epi-pen.  On the flight there was no record of our grandson's peanut allergy, we had requested no peanuts in the food, no one knew of this, the travel agent was given the information and gave it to Singapore Airlines. Our daughter had a seat on a long flight which would not recline on way Singapore to Copenhagen staff tried to pull it apart,  no luck, this is not so good in economy class. We did try to upgrade with our travel agent, for on way home only the cost of the seats escalated to 5 times more than what it was at Sydney airport and there were only 2 seats left. We were disillusioned. When we arrived in Sydney airport our luggage did not, due to the close times we had to get onto the plane nobody believed the luggage would make it, this was to be true. This is not to complain about Singapore Airlines but to please improve these things. It was quite stressful for all of the passengers to have such short periods with the flight changes to get on next plane. Of course the plane waited as there were so many passengers who had to get on the planes....but it was just too much to deal with.  Prior to this we had travelled with Singapore Airlines with no problem, what has happened.?",neutral

4054,"WOW!!!! I recently accompanied my husband to Singapore( again!) where he stopped on his was to Australia  for business.

He very kindly decided to spoil me by flying me in the Suites of this amazing Airline! 

I thought that the impeccable service, very comfortable bed  in luxurious surroundings, lovely food  were out of this world - they even brought my husband a “birthday cake” with fairy lights( to replace a candle ) at 4 am Singapore time  just before we landed!

That was until we climbed on the plane to come back to London! We were on the A380 with the new Suites ! 

We were met ( as we were on the way out ) by the head steward who greet us by name and offered to carry our hand luggage . The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and showed us to our seats 1F and 2F which turned out to be the size of a room with the beds dividing it ! We each had a huge arm chair that could swivel almost 360degrees! When we asked for the beds to be made -it turned into a very comfortable double bed ! 
The bathrooms were also very large and with only 6 passengers in Suites there was never a queue! One of the bathrooms even had a dressing table ! 

Needless to say the service was superb ( as it was on the first flight ) Jasmine, Edward, Louisa and Daniel made us feel like we were the only people on the plane - thank you for making it so special 

It is not a cheap way to fly but  well worth doing in you want to do something special !

THANK YOU AGAIN Singapore Airlines for another FABULOUS flight!",positive

4681,"Quality I have flown with Singapore airlines many times and they've been consistently good to I always try to book with them. Their economy cabins are roomy and comfortable, excellent customer service, on board entertainment is great, I always fly just with a carry on and there is always enough room in the overhead cabins. The food is great except once they gave me the vegetarian meal containing dairy and I don't eat dairy - I only noticed when I read the ingredients on a muffin. This could have been a bad experience for someone else with a severe dairy allergy. 

During another flight I was seated next to an elderly couple who were ceoliac and requested gluten free meals but their requests didn't come through for some reason. There were no gluten free meals on the flight but the Singapore team member put together some meals for them that looked better than whatever anyone else had, it was great they could accommodate for them so quickly.",positive
7200,"Flight to California, USA No doubt it’s Premium Economy but there don’t seem to be a big difference between Economy and Premium Economy. Such a vast difference from the SQ flight I took some 10 years back. Back then the seats were comfortable and the seat divider could be lifted up. So, if the seat beside you was vacant you could lift the seat divider, stretch out and at least catch a few hours of shut eye during the 15-17 hours of flight! Now, Premium Economy means you get seats that are a tad stiff though SQ is kind enough to give just a little more leg room. The quality of the meals have also gone down. Since I’m a vegetarian I opted for a Jain meal on my flight to LAX and a Chinese Oriental Vegetarian (COV) meal on my flight back. The Jain meal was somewhat acceptable and it did come piping hot! Now, the COV was a real disaster! It was white rice just warm, some vegi and a side dish (no idea what that was!) and a small bun of bread with butter provided (they used to give jam but have scrapped it!) There was no gravy or soup of any kind so I guess we are required to eat plain white rice with stir fry mixed green vegi! It was a dismal enough picture but I ate what I could since I had opted for it! Now, the service - some of the air stewardesses wear plastic smiles on their faces throughout the flight since for them it was just a line of duty, nothing more! With their impeccable appearances and heavy enough make up they do look a little like Barbie dolls! But to be honest in this bucket of bad apples there were one or two flight stewards/stewardess who were warm and easy to talk to. One kind steward lend me his personal usb cable to charge my iphone! So I guess SQ does not deserve anything lower than 6 on the scale! The toilets were acceptable though I feel SQ can do a bit more to prevent theft! I simply don’t understand why people think it is alright to take away the soap bottle! Oh yes, the liquid hand soap was missing in one toilet and when I queried a flight steward about it he said it was stolen! Now, the entertainment - the movies available were pathetic, especially for the Indian passengers! I had expected to see some of the latest movies but was deeply disappointed! Finally, I saw what was available and an old English classic - Seven Brides for Seven Brothers just to pass time! One good thing was there were USB slots to facilitate mobile phone charging and free Wi-Fi. Finally, a kudos to the pilots for safely bringing us to LA and back home. The flight at times seems to be a little bumpy which I guess is natural as we do have to bow down to Mother Nature! So, the seat belts sign came on and off frequently. Overall, I guess it was an acceptable flight, both ways but next time I may want to try other reputable airlines too just to compare notes! 🤔",neutral
7212,"Efficiency is the difference  I was so pleasantly surprised with SQ468 from Singapore to Colombo. This was a great start to my summer vacation. The aircraft was unfortunately showing its age though, however, the crew were extremely professional and courteous. The biggest highlight of the flight was the food which tasted great. The fish buriyani tasted authentic and was very palatable!

Christchurch, Singapore, Singapore, Bangkok, & return Koh Samui, Singapore, Singapore, Christchurch. Through Travel Agent FCM. ( A special one off family holiday) All flights were confirmed, and paid for (no special deals). Then on 22 Dec 2019. Singapore Airlines bumped 2 flights off the return flight Koh Samui, Singapore, Singapore, Christchurch. If I had not had issues trying to log my bookings with Kris Flyer I would have been up queer street. I contacted the travel agent, who then made further enquiries, only to discover those two flights had been cancelled by Singapore Airlines. Result:- Two of us had to come home via Bangkok Air to Singapore, then Singapore air to Christchurch, a day earlier than planned. We have been unable to claim the extra day's accommodation(owing to insurance excess). Singapore air has not apologised, nor did they offer any upgrade, nor compensation of any sort. We have not heard a whisper from them... Poor form Singapore Air. To make matters worse, it is impossible to contact them in person. The Travel agent was the meat in the sandwich & she did a wonderful job. We may have been sitting at the airport in Christchurch with the ground staff saying 'Sorry madam you have no return tickets, you are not leaving the country'...!!!

One of the flight attendant even spilled some tea on my jeans because he's too hurry. A bit hot, but I didn't quite mind it. 

Oh yeah, on the flight from SIN to ICN (I've a transfer in SIN) the air con was too cold (probably because it's autumn night) but It's still too damn cold.

2813,Nice touches  We recently flew Wellington to Melbourne and found the experience pretty good. They have some nice touches including hot towels and a printed menu for the forthcoming meal. Previous to the flight I had enquired about gluten free meals which they happily accommodated. On the off chance I also enquired about making one of them vegetarian and suddenly it was a huge deal requiring medical certificates and 2 weeks notice and the certificate would have to be sent to them which was a little odd I felt. I had specified it was just an enquiry so a simple yes or no would have sufficed. On the flight the attendants were polite however it was freezing cold and many passengers were asking for a blanket. Not sure why the necessity to have it SO cold that it was uncomfortable. Overall a good flight.,positive

She was a complete testament to herself and the training she has received. All the crew on the flight were very good but this young lady stood out.I did ask her for name and the contact in the Airline who I convey my gratitude. The names of the staff that she gave me were,Joe, Shanti, Hakeem Irwin Joanna and Wai Ling. I think that the paricular young lady was Wai Ling. Great stuff.

5443,"Cramped on Airbus A350 Disappointed that our favourite airline, Singapore, has configured this aircraft with the worst economy class seating I have experienced.   I am an average sized person, 184cm and 100 kg, and found a centre seat in a middle row of three extremely cramped and uncomfortable for a 9- hour flight.   Five stars for service; one star if possible for comfort.",positive

5845,"Don’t buy Premium Economy for the food Departure from Singapore for Melbourne was on time, however boarding was chaotic.  Premium Economy seat was more comfortable, wider and apparently with a greater incline and leg room.  I had traveled all of the previous night with a 7:45am boarding in Singapore and the only option on board was a continental breakfast; 5 cubes of fruit, a small burnt croissant but a very nice muffin, inadequate!  For lunch I chose oriental style pork: tasteless pork with a very thick sauce, well-seasoned rice and steamed unseasoned vegetables.   The sauce (being kind) was so thick it could not be incorporated with any other element of the dish; it was a separate unpleasant gelatinous ‘entity’.",neutral
1956,"Good but not amazing anymore I traveled on Singapore Airlines' business-class on Dec 25th 2019 after almost 16 years. The service is excellent but the food quality has degraded for sure. Western options like pasta are non-existent and Indian options are extremely spicy and harsh on your stomach especially when you travel. There were always one or two curries from the main dish that my entire family could not handle due to strong and pungent spices. The various types of breads are extremely greasy. Bathrooms are kept reasonably clean at all times and the staff is always eager to please. It makes up for the food and awkward seats in the business class wherein you have to sleep diagonally to rest your feet. Also, the mattress is builtin and exceptionally firm/hard making it less comfortable. Furthermore, in order to be environmentally friendly, they have stopped giving the complimentary vanity pouch/toiletries. 

Lastly, I was very disappointed by the ground staff that does the second screening for America bound travelers. I am a US Citizen with a TSA pre which means, I never need extra check in the US and yet the security person kept harassing me and finally asked me to dump my 4-ounce, half-used Burt-Bees powder which is ridiculous. Under the name of security, airline security staff is behaving like brain dead slaves. When will airlines petition to stop this madness under the name of security? Their businesses are getting killed and the profits are marginalized because people are apprehensive to travel.",positive

Contacted them through Facebook Messenger and was told they would ring me today, they didn’t. Rang and waited another hour on hold to then speak to a really rude agent. He said my flight to Darwin had been changed as original flight had been cancelled. I pointed out that my first and second flights now overlapped so that was absurd. He said that my third flight from Darwin to Alice Springs was also cancelled so he would put me on hold to ask what to do. I suggested it might be helpful to first find out what I wanted. He said he couldn’t do that! I said I had worked out alternative flights that I would like to be re-routed to. He said he couldn’t do anything without advice. I was then put on hold for a further ten minutes. He then came back and said he recommended that I just cancel the flights and my hotels. I said I am not cancelling my holiday, there are other airlines. I reminded him of the legal obligation to re-route my flights, said I would be complaining and asked his name. He refused to tell me and said the conversation was being recorded. I said that was good as SQ would be able to hear him refusing to offer me alternative flights. He then decided he could offer a re-route after all. I am a Krisflyer member and cannot believe how poor the SQ service has become. I will stick with Emirates in future.",negative

Checking staff at Heathrow airport, I forget her name, she is very nice lady and helpful . She greeted us with broad smile and helped us with clear information and direction on how to get to the departure gate as the location was quite walk distance from the check in counter.
Upon entering the aircraft, all crews members greeted us with warm hospitality  and one of them arranged and made sure my daughter's buggy kept safely in their luggage storage  .

Check-in and aircrew service faultless. Cabin configuration does not provide exclusive toilets or even conveniently located toilets and so you need to pass through economy to access them.

Both meals on the flight were served in nice cutlery and they set the table up for you - but the food was quite disappointing. The beef was rock hard so I couldn’t finish it.

774,"Singapore airlines broken 2 times in one trip To whom it may concerns,

I flew with Singapore Airlines from 0814-0821 between BKK and SG. I can't believe in just one week Singapore Airline broke my luggage twice. Honestly I am still in shock. 
 Singapore airline is globally renouned for its first-class service and during this trip I bought business class specifically just to experience it but got so disappointed in the end,

On 14-08-2022, I flew with SQ707 from Bangkok to Singapore for business. I landed just to found my luggage lost one wheel and its cover cracked in several places. I filed a complaint and the reference number is SINSQ52193. Since I don't have a usable luggage I had to be stuck in the same hotel for your staff to pick it up, fix and return it. I requested my luggage to be fixed at RIMOWA only but your staff said they can only ask their vendor to fix it. Since I only had one week in SG I said yes and they fixed & returned my luggage on 19-08-2022. The fixed wheel is different from the other three wheels and it looks a bit weird but I can live with it. 

I thought it's over, but On 22-08-2022, I flew back with SQ710 from Singapore to Bangkok. I landed and again found my luggage got crippled (one wheel hang loose to the case and it's not even the same one from last time). What's worse, the fixed wheel again got loose and a few more cracks was spotted on the cover. I had to file a complaint again and this time the reference number is BKKSQ37495.

I attached all the damage photos for your reference. I also checked with RIMOWA China team and they replied it cannot be properly fixed. Even it does it's costly and  I can only use it for a quite short time. I will check with RIMOWA store in Thailand again. 

At last, I have to say this is my worst flight ever. It's time-consuming, exhaustive and I have to re-schedule my plan since I don't have a usable luggage，and I have to buy a new suitcase to continue my trip. It ruined my trip completely and I really hope you guys can look into this and give me a solution. I‘ve try to sent 3 complain letters and instagrams ,NOBODY REPLY AND NOBODY CARES!THAT'S SO FUNNY AS A WORLD-WIDE 5STARS AIRLINES !!!",negative

2604,Schoolies Trip As always wonderful service from the crew of Singapore Airways. We had a first time flyer with us and they checked in often to see how she was doing. Only downside was of course the asshat(s) who insist on dropping their chairs back in economy ( honestly pay business and stop annoying everyone) as soon as the plane levels out.

5191,"Worst airline in the sky. Horrible customer service We bought our tickets for the holiday of a lifetime. Heading to London directly from Canberra you beauty no travelling to Sydney to fly internationally. I have flown Qatar before and was originally going to fly them but had seen ads saying how amazing Singapore was. This soon proved to be a mistake. 

We boarded our flight from Canberra to Singapore and that went fine, the plane was a little out of date and lacking modern touches. There were no personal AC vents to make you more comfortable which was annoying but ok. 

We arrived in Singapore following the flight and waiting to board our A380 SQ308 to London. We boarded without incident and located our seat for the very long flight to London. About 3-hours into the flight my wife and I had become comfortable enough to try and sleep. I slowly dozed off and initially dreamed I was caught in a summer shower as I was hot yet was being rained upon. I opened my eyes and to my horror saw an unidentified liquid running out from the light fitting directly into my crotch. Due to their being a man sleeping and my wife it took a few seconds to get out of my chair. After I had got out of the chair the water continued to stream and stream. I asked to be moved as I couldn’t sit on a wet chair under Niagara Falls. I was moved to a set of four seats with my wife with no where to lean against (the main reason I asked for an outer aisle window seat. It was at this point that I asked staff for further assistance with dry clothes. This was denied and I was offered a blanket to cover up and paper towels. I asked several more times for some dry pants from one of the upper classes as I knew they get them. This was repeatedly denied. After telling staff I could not possibly sit for a further 13 hours with wet pants. Several members of staff arrived again seeming to not know how to handle the situation. I again asked for pants which was finally granted after 5-15 minutes post waterfall. 

No member of staff was able to explain what the liquid was that had leaked out of the roof or how it came to be in my lap. I made contact with the airline on arrival and my complaint appears to have been brushed off. I was merely offered a lousy $100 gift card in lieu of an upgrade or partial refund of my flight. I was also told the liquid was water from the AC even though no AC appeared to be overhead. I was also denied access to the engineers report and my request for a review of my complaint fell on deaf ears. 

Apart from the flight home that I have already paid for I will never use the airline again, buyer beware of the cheap airfares.",negative

2816,"Glad we upgraded This is one journey which involved two flights with Singapore airlines - a smaller plane Airbus 350 for the shorter leg from Brisbane to Singapore  then Airbus 380 for Singapore to Heathrow. Unfortunately the larger plane was older and less comfortable with the old fashioned handset to control the entertainment. We upgraded to Premium Economy mostly due to legroom but the second leg was quite empty and many customers in economy had a whole row of seats so could lie down. 

The food in both legs was poor quality - toasted sandwich and soggy noodles. We had unsuccessfully tried to do ""Book the Cook"" - people who had got served first and ensured their choice. Drinks are not offered as often or generously as on other airlines - they do come round with cups of water and juice but  no welcome glass of fizz when you board and no specific drinks service so no gin and tonic then wine with dinner unless you actually ask for it. I asked for a diet coke and the stewardess poured half a glass from a can but didn't give me the rest of the can. 

Unsurprisingly the entertainment has a high proportion of Asian films so unlike other long haul carriers very few current films - so I caught up on some box sets (eg Chenobyl) but there's a wide music choice including some relaxation/sleep promotion. I found the cabin temperature varied a lot - one leg was very cold but the second leg was uncomfortably warm and stuffy (perhaps to send us to sleep) and it was quite noisy - we've been spoiled by Dreamliners which are far quieter.The amenity pack has socks, eyemask and a toothbrush. 

It was quite turbulent so we had to stay seated with seatbelt on a lot, so trying to get to the toilet was difficult as sometimes people had been queuing and hen had to sit down before using the facilities. 

Staff are charming and polite  but not overly friendly or chatty - it's quite a subservient approach. The safety briefing is lovely though as  it incorporates a beautifully filmed travelogue about Singapore. From what others have told me Emirates is a better carrier for Australia but we chose Singapore Airlines as we preferred Singapore to Dubai for a stopover",neutral

Seat:56H
Into the tunnel, we ventured that would take us to our plane. Because we required the assistance of walking sticks we were first.

Soon as we approached and could see the doors of the plane, we were welcomed by three sincere smiling faces.

We entered the plane. My wife and I hobbling along with our walking sticks, following the flight attendant to our seat.

""Take your time please, no rush"" we were told as we found our seat.

Not just words, because their careful actions showed they did care. They wanted us to enjoy the experience flying with them.

We did feel very special and calm and soon we were at our seats.

The flight attendance crew worked as one. They made sure we did not need any help putting up our luggage. We knew and felt very comfortable to ask for assistance any time we required it.

The other passengers too began slowly entering the plane. There was no rush everyone knew they would be taken care of. They soon with assistance, when required, put their luggage up for the flight.

The flight attendants were always within easy reach. They ensured everybody was comfortable and not requiring any assistance.

The flight attendance appeared to read each other minds. Just a nod and they would split into three and serving hot white fluffy towels. A wonderful way to prepare us for our flight. Just as efficient as they were given to us, they whisked them away with the same efficiency.

It was unbelievable the flight attendants knew when they were required.

Wine! for those interested. Juices, coffee, tea and even water to help us feel even more comfortable with the flight in front of us.

Food, glorious food. Prepared in a professional manner. The taste, better than most first class restaurants.

The passengers sit peacefully, enjoying the gentle hum of the aircraft, or watched a movie.that was situated at the back of each seat.

It is so peaceful and relaxing some passengers go to sleep, covered in the blanket provided to all the passengers.

The hours ticking away, most not noticing.

The flight attendance shows no sign of tiredness or boredom. They continue their watch over their passengers, like a hen looking after her newly hatched chickens.

If your eyes meet theirs, they smile, stop to see if you need anything, and ten continue their endless walk up and down the isles of the plane.

Another warm while the fluffy towel is provided, so we can prepare, to go to our new destination.

A final message from the pilot thanking us for not causing problems and hoped we had enjoyed all the crew staff hard work, for our short time together.

The plane comes to a halt. The passengers slowly find their luggage and line up to face the outside world.

552,"Wonderful service After reading some negative reviews I was concerned about flying but I certainly should NOT have been. The service was second to none. The staff were very professional  but o friendly and nothing was too much trouble. ?the beds were comfy, there was plenty of room and the entertainment choice was wide and varied with recently released films for February 2023 available.
Would highly recommend this company",positive
1693,"Great Flight, Great Crews, Great Service Our flight from Heathrow to Brisbane was via Singapore, with just a 70 minute layover in Singapore to get from one aircraft to the other.  The purpose of this flight was to visit friends prior in Currumbin prior to commencing back to back cruises ou of Sydney t the Gold Coast, Great Barrier reef and also New Zealand.  The flight was to be the commencement of a holiday of a lifetime to also encompass part of our 40th Wedding Anniversary.

From the very moment we set foot on the aircraft we were made to feel at home.  Nothing was too much trouble for the crew.  Who even surprised my wife with an anniversary cake and two Singapore Airlines teddy bears as a memento of our flight and anniversary.  The food was excellent on both flights.

Our UK return flight, 35 days later were also with Singapore Airlines and again their service was excellent.  Although we flew economy, we did not feel like second class citizens.  The only downside to the whole experience was that our return flight from Singapore to Heathrow was on a slightly smaller aircarft than the others we had been on and hence shorter leg room, other than that we have no hesitation in recommending this airline and will not hesitate to use them in the future",positive
7239,"Worse business class seats ever Singapore Airlines use to be my favorite. Not any more. We took a 17 hour flight from LAX to SIN.  I was looking forward to a  restful flight and and sleep. Did not happen. The seat had to be manually flipped by a flight attendant.   It is the flat but you would have to be less 5feet to be able to stretch out. Otherwise you had to curl in a fetal position. 

The service was good but not great. 

We flew a few weeks earlier on Turkish from Istanbul to LA. That was much better.",negative

The flight was very nice and smooth.

Other than the 3/4 reclining seat, the aircraft was beautiful. Singapore airlines is a cut above the rest.",positive
7716,"Disappointed This was our first long haul flight of this length, due to this we felt we would use a larger carrier as we thought we would get a better service. Our plane from London to Singapore was a 777 which should have been great, having read the website and seen all the lovely pictures our expectations were high, even in economy there were claims of ample room, great food and service, this was far from what we had for 13 hours, cramped seats in a very dated airplane, poor food and cabin staff that were hiding behind curtains for most of the trip, our connecting flight was NZ Airlines and on a 787, the plane,food and staff were far better than the last. The plus side was how they dealt with a late departure and getting everyone on their connecting flight, this was done exceptionally well and hats off to the staff at Singapore Airport who were positioned everywhere to spot passengers and get them to the right gate. If you can afford it go better than economy.",neutral
8230,Long haul non stop to New York Was on the new SQ 22 flight to New York for holiday. Was told happen to be the 3rd of flight since SQ restart non stop to NY. Premium economy was just right for the 19 hours non stop flight. Ticket was a little pricey compare to economy but then the comfort of seat and space make it up. Meals was not that fantastice  as would have expected a little more choices. Incidentally took SQ 21 on return three weeks later. Overall good experience.,positive
5613,"Not worth the premium price We flew premium economy from Singapore to Frankfurt on A380. We were looking forward to it as we were flying premium economy on SQ for the first time and had high expectations since the aircraft was the new A380.

To be upfront, the leg room was pretty generous, def better than economy class. There were also numerous usb charging points at our seats and below the inflight entertainment screen. There were also plenty of storage spaces for water bottles and nick-nacks.

Now to the less impressive points:

Premium economy passengers shared the same restrooms as economy passengers, and we had to walk to the back of the next economy section to get to the restrooms. It was a further walk for us compared to economy passengers.

The overnighter kit was very ordinary, just socks and toothbrush, nothing fancy.

While there was a lot of leg room, the seat wasnt very comfy for me, even though I reclined my seat to the max it could go, and had the reclining leg rest up. It left me with a bad backache.

The inflight entertainment selection was poor. The titles were old and selection was not enough. The screen was not touchscreen as well, surprising for A380.

We had 1 more selection for mains compared to economy but the food was forgettable, except for the ice cream.

Either go business class or stick to economy. The additional price to pay for premium economy isnt well worth it.",neutral

# The cabin crew so polite, friendly and listening what I need. 
#You will not feel bore on board as they provide you with nice movies, music, TV channel, books, news. 
#And the foods are amazing, the tastes is five star taste.

Even though ticket that I bought little bit expensive as it is peak season right now but it is worth of it.

5706,"Singapore to London Heathrow Airbus A380 We have flown with Singapore airlines a few times now. They are usually very good but this was probably the least enjoyable flight experience we have had. Our flight was delayed for three hours, to wait for a connecting flight. The first passengers knew of this was when those using the Singapore Airlines app were notified. At first, the ground staff were unable to confirm whether the information on the app was correct as the airport screens were still showing the original departure information. Communication between the airline and the waiting passengers was very poor. The airline staff seemed confused about what was happening. It took a couple of hours to arrange hot drinks and snacks for the waiting passengers. Most of the time was made up in the air so arrival at Heathrow was only about an hour late. Usually Singapore airlines are very good but this experience has changed my opinion a little.",positive
5194,"Very enjoyable flight, great food and service We flew overnight to Milan in one of Singapore Airlines newer jets and it’s clear why they were nominated as best airline in the world.  The food was terrific.  We order low fat meals because not only do you get them first, they never run out and they are better for you.  As always the cabin service was friendly and not intimidating like Qantas or BA and you could find a stewardess when you needed one.  Check in and baggage drop off is simple and there are plenty of machines in Perth.  The flights were without incident, comfortable all the way with good landings.

The most impressive new feature in economy class is the infotainment system, which has an impressive flight tracking module.

Can recommend this airline to anyone",positive

I contacted my bank and they replied within one day to say that it is indeed SIA putting through the extra charges. I emailed the reply from my bank to SIA  and SIA has stopped replying. I am so disappointed. Why is it so hard to get good customer service these days?

5904,"Underwhelmed I’ve always had the highest regard for SQ inflight service but my most recent flight was so disappointing.

Flew SQ232 SYD–SIN, March 31st, Seats 16D&F, Business Class on the new A380.

It started out well…Check in Staff and Ground Manager at Sydney Airport were super congenial.

We were warmly welcomed at the Air New Zealand Lounge - super-fast wifi and amazing Anzac biscuits.

First impressions of the seat were great – lovely seat design touches, duvet and pillows.

Then it went downhill fast.

• Stewardess told me that the aircraft was three business class passengers overbooked. Crew all seemed flustered throughout the flight. 

• Husband’s seat didn’t come equipped with headphones. No problem as he had his own. Stewardess nevertheless apologized and said that she had no time to check the left side of the plane (only the right) as they were pressed for time with boarding passengers. Not good.

• Drink of sparkling water was served in a small whisky glass without napkin. Again, stewardess mentioned that the usual tall glass was on order and not available for this flight. Napkin was presented long after drink was consumed.

• Husband’s ‘Book The Cook’ pre-order of Seafood Thermidor was completely inedible. My Thai Green Curry was not much better. 

• My tray table could not be ejected halfway through the flight. After the horrible meal I didn’t intend to eat anymore anyway.

• Bathrooms reeked

• Fruit was served without plate, cutlery and napkins. Yup, I was expected to bite into the fruit with my hands.

• Seat looked good but don’t try to get some sleep with the ridiculous angled footwell. Unless you’re booked into the much-prized bulkhead seats, all other Biz passengers have to lie diagonally to fit their feet into the footwell of the seat in front of them. I heard many passengers remark what a stupid design this was and I whole-hearted agreed with them. Won’t avoid these seats like the plague from now on!

Finally the piece de resistance! 

The PPS passenger in 16A could not right his seat after it was deployed in bed mode. The Crew, after a good 45 mins or so of attempting to fix the bed, finally relocated the passenger. In the meanwhile, he was left hovering in the aisle the whole time! Shocking!

Just when we thought the debacle was over, a Cabin Manager (there were two on this flight) managed to fix the seat. After which, he took it upon himself to train groups of the inflight crew, three at a time no less, on how to manipulate the seat... Oblivious to the fact that the Crew meanwhile were blocking up the aisle and that passengers could not access the lavatories at the back of the cabin (there were none in front for Business passengers)! After a good half hour at least, my husband had enough of the bodies intruding into his personal space. He asked a Leading Stewardess if this was a safety issue  – if not, shouldn’t training be done after the passengers deplaned and not while the flight was in service? Promptly the Crew scattered. No apologies given. My fellow passengers were shaking their heads in disbelief!

Pity to see how the standards of SIA service has fallen. One would have expected the Senior Crew at best, to have more polish and common sense.",negative

143,"Lost luggage Lombok airport Recently used Singapore airlines, unfortunately flight from UK to Singapore was running 45 minutes late, we just made our onward flight from Singapore to Lombok. Service at Singapore was excellent.
Our bags did not make the onward flight.
These things happen, however the service we then had was terrible, the customer service rep at Lombok was useless, we landed , were then informed that our cases were not on the flight, told we would get them three days later, ABI the service rep filled out the paperwork. Turns out he did not fill in the forms correctly, he did not give us a tracking number, he did not make copies, so waste of time as forms that were filled out he gave to us.
We then used Singapore airlines online/live chat to try and find out where our luggage was. They were very unresponsive as they did not have a lost luggage tracking number, I thought they could enter our luggage label number. 
Told me to go back to the airport, since this was nearly a two hour trip I declined.
ABi did not answer my texts to my Satisfaction, when cases did arrive at 1030 he said he had to Finnish his shift at 15.00 before sending them on.
When he did send them on we had to pay for boat to bring cases over to island we were staying on, then pay the local taxi to bring them from the boat to the villa.
This could have been way more professional.
Filing in form correctly so we had a valid code we could chase up.
Singapore airlines being more helpful 
I don’t think we should have to pay to get our luggage delivered 
And just any type of communication with the airline/airport service rep, instead of ignoring the vast majority of my texts, NEVER answered the phone.
Can’t wait to discuss this in person on my way back through Singapore",negative

Same as I flew before, but now worn and dirty, gross inedible food and an unfortunate delay in getting us to the airport in time for our flight caused us to pay an extra $2000 to fly with this airline. Be aware, they have a $500 missed flight fee. So even if we would have been able to take a cheaper flight to out our destination bc of our unforseen delay, we would have to pay $1000 just to catch the flight back we already paid for. Just think about that for a second, because it could happen to you. So we ended up rebooking on another flight with them for over $2000 dollars. Choose another airline.",negative

First of all flight delayed for a hour because of the stupid reason that engineer had called in sick . When reaching Tokyo exhausted because of the chasing next flight at Singapore , my luggage was left behind at Singapore. Thankfully Japanese luggage handling team deals very professionally and deliver my luggage next day. 
On the way back to Perth , we told the lady at Singapore airlines check in time that please make sure our luggage will be arrive at time . She even added the priority tag . Flight was ok to Singapore . Flight attendants were looks very rush for everything and a very slow service . After that we arrive at Singapore and went to catch the next flight . Again the flight was delayed , flight attendants were agin rushed for everything and service was way too slow . And not forget to mentioned but the planes from both Perth to Tokyo and Tokyo to Perth was quite dirty and dusty. We can see they don’t clean the seat pockets as we find the used tissues and plastics were not cleaned . When we arrived at Perth , same story happens again , one of our luggage missing . We talked to the (Dnata) baggage handling desk lady and her respond was so rude. She said we can’t track your luggage so we don’t know anything . We are here just for customer service . Very very unprofessional and very loudly screaming to the customer . She keep
Saying she don’t know so please don’t ask anymore , once we got your luggage we will deliver to your house.

7211,"OMG.. FLIGHTS FROM HELL!! So reassured that Singapore Airlines ranks among the top three airlines and having flown on their competitors, Eithiad and Emirates, thought everything would be good! NOT SO!! I took no less than 4 different flights, on my trip of a lifetime, to Australia in December and each flight was appalling for various reasons!
Food... indescribable... take yr worst Chinese takeaway and scrape it off the floor! Woken at strange times for what might be breakfast or whatever.. indistinguishable from the disgusting food served... only nice moment was being served a crispy red apple at ""Whatever o clock"". 
Cramped with my feet around my elbows and hostile seat companions on all trips! I am 5ft 10ins told I should pay extra for space!
Curt air hostesses, too much trouble to have coffee or tea after meal as not being on a special diet was only served nearly 2 hours after the special diets.. trays whipped away as within 1/2 hour of landing (My outward trip)! 
I could go on.. this was a trip of a lifetime for me.. a nurse.. it cost a hell of a lot of money and when faced with a return trip from Australia to UK just wanted to cry!!
NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!

251,"Phenomenal service is an understatement! Phenomenon service is an understatement to this airline.
I have taken many trips with many different airlines over part decades but Singapore airlines definitely give me a different perspective what an airline or airline services should be.
They are very attentive, attention to details and very professional. On this trip, we took some of our trips with business class and some with economy. Both class provided exceptional services.
One of my meals, from Singapore back to Newark, steak with oxtails and vegetables was one of my most delicious meals to remember. Man oh man, it was one of the best meals I have ever had on air.  I usually have low regards for foods on air due to the atmospheric and pressure charges and taste buds changes but they managed make one of the most delicious steak that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  By the way, I'm a steal lover. They executed my steak dish to almost perfection. The steak was medium, my favorite. The shredded oxtails was tasty, tendered and melt in your mouth. The veggies were perfectly cooked.  One of the gentlemen gave me two different glasses of wines afterwards,n per my request, and they were great also. I gave my honest compliment to the gentleman who served my wines  and he brought the chef over to thank my compliment.  What a service!  I regret I didn't take the picture of my steak plate. 🤦‍♂️

6163,"9 years of flying with Singapore Airlines We have an annual trip to Perth Australia and having in the early years tried other Airlines, we now only use Singapore Airlines.
The seating in Economy is very generous and comfortable even after 12 hours. The plane is always kept tidy and clean thanks to the deligence of the cabin crew.
The food is good with a selection of European and Asian dishes and of course you can choose a dietary need when booking your flight.
Wine, beer and spirits is offered as well as soft drinks. This year we did notice that they were not quite so generous as previously. We felt this was a sign of Singapore’s financial situation, never the less if you asked for more it was given without hesitation.
Water and juice is regularly bought around to keep you hydrated, which is very important.
Checking in process is efficient and as with all of the Singapore Airlines staff are pleasant and helpful.
For parents with babies the cabin crew do what they can to help make things easier. Staggered meal times so you both get a hot meal and the heating of bottle or food pouches or jars.
The toilet facilities on the plane are spacious and well supplied and maintained.
The in flight entertainment is the best that I have come across. Plenty of new release films as well as the old goodies.
The music selection I felt was not so good as before, it seemed more limited. One thing that I felt was missing was audio books. These have been deleted from the package.
The price structure of Singapore Airlines is good, they are in line with Emirates but cheaper than Virgin, BA and Quantus.",positive

However, the Changi Airport personnel asked me to JUNK the same jar of honey in the trash can upon boarding going to Manila as ""they don't allow liquids"" in the carry-on even after explaining to them that IT WAS ALLOWED BY THE SAME AIRLINE from Dubai.

4227,"Don’t ever pay to pre-book your seats  I am currently in Bali due to return back to the Uk tomorrow. This was a special holiday for my husbands 50th birthday and a present for my daughters 21st. The flights were booked in August last year with Lufthansa on a code share with Singapore from Frankfurt to Singapore and then back from Singapore to Munich. I had heard fantastic reviews on Singapore Airlines and as we usually travel with Emirates I decided to do these flights to enhance the experience a little. In April I rang Singapore Airlines to enquire about pre-booking our seats. I have a bad neck and back so always find it a little easier on long haul having the window to lean against. I paid an extra £100 for window seats both out & return. The seats were showing on the app and I received an email confirmation with the seat numbers but when I went to check in the seats had changed outbound, luckily the allocated seats were still up front but the return had disappeared. I have spent the last 2 weeks emailing them to sort these seats out. It is now the day before we leave and we have been given seats 62DEG which are the last row on the plane (A350-900) which on seat guru are classed as bad seats and limited recline next to the galley and toilets. I must have sent about 20 emails, had around 15 live chats and the response i have finally had this afternoon is ‘there is nothing we can do’ speak to check in tomorrow. I’m disgusted with how they treat their customers and as a result of this will never fly with them again. They just don’t seem interested when something goes wrong. 
I can’t fault the service on board or the planes but the customer service behind the scenes is shocking.",neutral
8234,"Great comfortable flight Just as we entered the aircraft, we collected our ear pieces for the inflight entertainment. I did not see a copy of my favourite newspaper and asked the stewardess at the door. She mentioned that because it was a midnight flight and most people would have read the papers by then and the next day's papers were not out yet. After takeoff, I was pleasantly surprised when the stewardess came to me with a copy of the newspaper I had asked about. She even addressed me by my name. What an amazing effort! In fact I had forgotten about it because I was busy filling out the landing form, deciding what to choose for my meal, deciding what movies to watch, etc. What the stewardess did made such a good impression on me. Way to go, Singapore Airlines!!!",positive

1423,"Horrible experience I am extremely dissappointed of Singapore airlines, the flight we planned to take just took off secretly without calling the passengers to board! Simply not acceptable and I think it is not qualified to be an operating airline company.

Because of Singapore's Covid-19 entry ban just one day before our flight, Singapore airline decides to NOT let any of the non-Singaporean passengers to board. There're several layers of unacceptable mistakes: 1. while booking, passengers are not informed of possible travel bans 2. after booking, Singapore airline does not send notification messages to remind passengers of the travel ban in action 3. right at the airport at the gate, Singapore airline just BLOCK the entire boarding area and secretly let allowed passengers to board - without informing all the other non-Singaporean passengers, and let us all wait until the plane takes off. The most ridiculous part is, we even approach the ground staff asking when we are allowed to board, and the staff simply asked us to wait. After the scheduled take-off time the staff just left the boarding gate and left all the remaining passengers wait for nothing, without a single announcement or apology.

Have no more words to say, Singapore airline's attitude to their customers are simply unacceptable and I do not think it is qualified as an airline company.",negative

All the basics were well done from check in to boarding and during the flight. Staff were polite and friendly. Food was average. There was little to complain about. However was anything a standout? No. Do other airlines like Cathay, Qantas etc do just as good a job? Yes.

So, I would recommend SQ but I wouldn’t say it’s the best airline in the world which is what it was rated in the last two years.",positive

986,"Singapore airline is moving towards a budget line I flew Singapore Airlines after a while and soon realised the star rated airline is moving towards a budget airline. Their world class service levels have come down significantly. The time to load the aircraft, cabin service, food and beverage services were notably lower. However I must mention the two aircrafts I flew A350  and  B787 had very smooth ride, had less noise and cabin space was much better. My expectation was a world class service once they had and now they SA is pretty much in par with Malaysian, SriLankan airlines.",neutral

9137,"Awesome Singapore service I flew IAH/Manchester/Singapore/Denpasar and the reverse home. Business class flights on SIN were wonderful as usual.  Staff impeccable, and food sublime. Only a couple of issues... the lay flat seats were terribly hard.  I had to use my blanket as additional padding. When you are paying so much to lay flat it should be comfortable!

Also, the DPS to SIN flight was sub business class, glorified economy as it lacked privacy and ALL bags had to be put above as they had no storage for take off and landing.  Not what I expected/paid for.

Bus Class no longer gets amenities package other than sox and eye mask.  I suppose having generic toothbrushes/paste, shared lotion, etc in plane bathrooms saves money.  Ear plugs would be nice to have back as well.

For the cost Wifi should be included.

On a positive note, when SIN was delayed an hour out of singapore waiting for late passengers I was worried about making my connection in IAH.  The first leg staff were changed to different staff out of Manchester, so I had to revoice my concerns before leaving ""stopover"" in England.  Surpisingly there was a Singapore airline representative available as soon as I deplaned in IAH to help me whisk through baggage/customs.  I was greatly appreciative.",positive
7378,"It is true - a great way to fly This was the first time we have flown with Singapore Airlines and it won't be the last. Their service is legendary and it is quite obvious why. From the moment we checked in until the time we got off our flight, we had excellent service from the ground staff and the flight attendants.
I was looking forward to flying on an A380 and I was not disappointed. The plane itself is so quiet even when all engines are on full power. The business class seats are so wide that my wife and I could actually sit together in one seat. There is so much room when the seat is laid flat to make a bed that unless you are exceptionally tall, there is ample room.
We Booked the Cook before we left and the food was exactly what we ordered. Excellent food and beverages all the way from Sydney to Singapore.

The flight attendants certainly know how to look after passengers. Quite outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. We have flown with Ethiad, Air New Zealand and Qantas in business class and Singapore Airlines is certainly as good as all three.
 We have no qualms about flying with them again.",positive

Besides complimenting on all your staff who I encountered throughout my different SQ flights that I took, I have to mention the flight crew  (Lisa NG, Alla, Michelle Tan & JJ) on my flight to Singapore from Frankfurt. My small earbuds fell into the gap between my seats and the effort that was put to find them was extraordinary and finally they could find it. Then I was missing a small pouch with all all cables which I could not locate. Even after the flight crew came and searched it could not be found. I had given up; thinking that i must have lost it the last lounge I visited. Later after about an hour,  NG again came and asked me if she could help and figure out where i could have left it. Then I realized that it was tucked into the dark corner below the SG headphones. This is what I call customer service. Perhaps the best in the world. I wish Singapore Airlines all the best and wish them success. I am now your b",positive

6947,"Delays outbound  On a recent trip with a small group travelling to The UK we were met at Melbourne airport with the news of a delay of 1 hour.
This delay then extended to 2..5 hours.   This meant we would miss connecting in Singapore with the redt of our group and our connecting flight.    After speaking with ground staff, they explained that the optiond wete splitting our group over the next two connecting flights or all on the same flight the next day.  This would cause significant logistic problems connecting with our UK tour.  When pushing staff in Melbourne further they explained it would be up to the staff in Singapore to make those decisions. 
Meal vouchers were given for everyone in Melbourne. 
We eventually got underway and upon arrival in Singapore we fojnd the connecting flight had been held for us.
Unfortunately when taxing out a passenger took ill. Being a medical professional I assisted and the decision was made to offload the passenger.  We finaly got jnderway 3 and a half hours late.  The rest of the flight was uneventful. 
Well done to Singapore Airlines for everything they did to minimise the disruption , however Very little eas said to me for assisting the crew with the sick passenger,  we do take a lot of responsibility on ourselves when reaching out to give a hand.",neutral
5247,"Mediocre SQ service I have always been proud of my national carrier and would try and book an SQ flight for my holidays to experience their exceptional service. 

My friend and I were due to fly back from Tokyo to Singapore and an Airbus A380. I was excited for the flight as my experience with the A380 had been pleasant so far.

Throughout the flight, I made a few observations that I felt were uncharacteristic of the SQ experience I knew:

1. The personal touch of the cabin crew was lacking.
While the crew in charge of my section executed their responsibilities professionally, I felt that they could have been smiled a little more. 

The stewardesses requesting for the passangers to bring their seat upright for meal services or asking the passengers for their choice of meal, did so with a poker face in a tone that felt more like an order than a request. 

During the beverages service, I made a request for a cup of Apple juice. As the stewardess did not have it on hand, she told me that she would get back to me. I guess she was busy with other requests and she never got back to me after that.

I understand that I am nitpicking and that the crew may be tired or on a tight schedule. However, as a supporter of SQ, I hope that they can maintain the level of standards passangers worldwide have grown accustomed to. A simple smile along with a “please” and “thank you” can go a long way in making a flight more pleasant. 

2. The interior of the cabin looked dated.
The first thing I noticed when I sat down was how the tray tables seemed a little yellow and old on the underside. The headrest also looked like it had not been cleaned in awhile. 

On the plus side, my companion thourghly enjoyed his lunch of cold Japanese noodles served with chicken. 

I sincerely hope this is a one-off experience that does not reflect the current level of service standards within Singapore Airlines.",neutral
914,"Davao on a B737-8 MAX Lounge : SilverKris Lounge
Very disappointing. A lounge at Changi which provides access to every Star Alliance Business Class passenger , is bound to get overcrowded. Despite the multi-million dollar 'renovation' , the seating plan was not carefully considered. We were lucky enough to ""grab"" a sofa in a silent corner of the lounge , but we could see everyone who came after us struggling to find even a basic seat.

Boarding : The biggest flaw at SIN ( and CMB / KUL / etc. ) is their security check policy , which happens right at the boarding gate. This forces everyone to proceed to the gate atleast an hour in advance , and get locked up in a small glass enclosure until boarding. P.s.- No priority lanes for security.

Seat / Layout :
The Business Class cabin on board this 737-8 MAX has 10 LIE-FLAT seats arranged in 3 rows as 2-2 , 1-1 & 2-2. Very comfortable indeed. Seat controls worked perfectly fine.

Service : Very professional & courteous crew.

Flew in Christmas Eve 
To be told only one of our 4 bags arrived 
Assured that they would be on the 2am next flight and delivered 7am the next morning 
(Was clearly a lie to send us away) 
All the Christmas presents in them 
Contact number provided nobody would answer I tried probably 50x 
We told the kids we were assured they would come 
Long story short 
3 days later we received a call saying they were on the flight that day and would be delivered that afternoon 
So we lost 3 days of our holiday waiting around for our bags couldn’t go out 
No compensation at all offered 
So I emailed asking to be refunded for the almost $600 we had to spend on emergency things 
We were offered only after complaining $300 
I refused and demanded a full compensation they then gave me a full refund plus $200 duty free for our trouble 
From my perspective 
We paid $3,000 
For our tickets 
(I could have flown to Europe for that much!! ) 
I expect a better service for the cost of our tickets additionaly I expect more than $200 for loosing 3 days of our holiday and ruining Christmas for the kids

Bizarrely for a flight taking off at 9am in the morning, and travelling to a time zone that was only 1 hour difference, most people travelled with their shades down - although the cabin lights never went off.  Some people choosing to sleep, but the main meal is served about 3 hours from takeoff around “midday” origin time, but did notice the captain was a little overzealous on the seatbelt sign - not sure if this was due to anticipated turbulence (wasn’t much) or just a way of controlling the masses.

That's because when the plane was going to land in Singapore, my two children cried. while I was carrying a baby, there was a cabin crew coming to calm down my daughter with earplugs. then came the cabin of another crew carrying candy and feeding my child. then came the cabin crew again carrying cookies. and finally there was another cabin crew carrying some pillows and putting them on my child's back.

109,We had a great experience on Singapore Airlines in Coach This was our first time flying on Singapore Airlines.  I can understand why they are consistently called the best airline in the world.  We traveled in coach.  The seat was comfortable and had enough legroom and I am tall.  The food served in coach was quite good.  You can actually choose your entree a day or two before your flight.  Everything was a good experience.  We would definitely fly with them again.,positive
5279,"Simply the best. If I have a problem with Singapore Airlines its that it has made it harder to retain your Gold Membership by reducing the points I travel by fifty percent. I was close to retaining my membership so I e-mailed Krisflyer but they never returned me message, so bad luck, what a shame.",positive
9205,"First experience with Singapore Airlines This was my first time flying with Singapore Airlines. I usually fly premium economy on my regular visits to New Zealand but on this occasion I chose to fly economy. I was happy with my aisle seats and there was enough leg room (although being only 5ft tall that's never really an issue). The food was average in my opinion. In-flight entertainment was good with plenty of choices of films, radio and TV shows. The cabin crew were very attentive and extremely well turned out - the ladies looked so elegant and the men looked very distinguished (other airlines should take their example). My other disappointment was that the booking class I flew didn't qualify for any airpoints under the Star Alliance scheme so sadly I didn't earn any from the thousands of miles I flew to and from  NZ.",positive
2251,"Disappointing Service, Food and Ambience The service was bad. One forgot my orange juice, food came reallly slow (and it was also very chaotic), the air stewardess forgot to serve the man on my left until later, ran out of food choices (told my sister they had no more chicken left but then later appeared with more for the passengers in front..??), one of the air stewards was rather rude, the  food tasted bad (compared ti other airlines like Finnair or Swiss Air which is good!!) and the air stewardesses/stewards did not even ask the person in front to put their seats upright so that I can actually eat (until I ask them). 

The flight from Singapore to Beijing was also bad. Encountered the same bad service as stated above. So both flights there and back were unpleasant. My family felt the same way. 

Just saying that I don't think I will ever pay a premium price just to sit SQ airline ever again. Very disappointed in the service because SQ used to be so good but now I feel like the standard has dropped significantly. I would say that it no longer belongs to the top few airlines in the world.",negative

5447,"Blessed with the best service! As I also work for a airline when reviewing other airlines I look for everything I would expect from my own service. This was the first time I flew with Singapore Airlines and Ill tell you now it wont be the last. From the moment we stepped on the aircraft we were greeted and made to feel welcome. My son who is 9 was asked his name, given a special kids pack and was told he would be lucky enough to get his food given to him first and asked what he would like. We were given a hot towel and menus all before we took off. Before the service started my son received his meal and drinks and always greeted with his name which was a neat bonus that they always remembered. Everything was awesome, movie selection, pillow and blanket, food with a nice warm bread roll and customer service was great. The crew were well groomed and from hello to goodbye Singapore Airlines was just amazing. Well done! Great first experience and I definetly recommended.",positive
3536,"Reliable and comfortable Having flown SA before we were looking forward to it again. We flew on SA as part of a codeshare on a Swiss Airlines tickets.

Happy to fly SA at any time.",positive
1126,"Predatory Itinerary Changes Singapore airlines changed our flight at the beginning of our honeymoon trip to the same itinerary exactly one day later, which caused our quarantine hotel reservation to be invalid. Our trip to Indonesia requires a strict quarantine procedure, and a multi-night stay in a non-refundable quarantine hotel. The new itinerary prevents us from being able to begin our stay at the quarantine hotel on the correct day, and invalidates our entire prepaid, non-refundable package.

I have now been on the phone a total of 4 hours and 45 minutes trying to resolve this situation, the first 3 hours of which I was on hold, and the representative has given me two options. I can either get a refund and rebook a much more expensive flight, or pay an additional $400 dollars per person to be moved to our original flight (the same original itinerary). 

A more appropriate and fair resolution would have been to waive the additional fee and restore our original itinerary, which is still available.

This is clearly a predatory business practice designed to extract more money out of customers who fly economy, and is extremely dishonest. I would recommend not booking Singapore Airlines for any future travel.

Zero stars.",negative
3897,"Wouldn't fly again SQ36 Let me begin by saying I'm a frequent Star Alliance traveler and that one of the best airlines in my opinion is Singapore Airlines.

Flight SQ36 in one of the longest flights to take.  The plane doesn't feature Economy Class, but Premium Economy.

This particular day, as always according to flight attendant, the plane was fully booked so the feeling of being in Premium Economy  dissapeared as soon as entering the plane. It was like flying in a normal Economy Class.

Odors in the cabin were disgusting at sometimes even the flight attendants tried to keep everything in good shape.  One of the toilets wasn't working so restrooms were pretty crowded too. 

Food was good, entertainment onboard was boring, and seats uncomfortable.  As it is Premium Economy armrests are fixed giving you no room to move, even the next seat is available.

The full cabin gives the sensation of a normal economy class.  Check well price before buying, it may be better to fly via Tokyo or Seoul, at least you will be sure that cabin will be fresh for the second leg of your trip, plus changing planes allow you to walk and stretch.",positive
2593,Safe and pleasant flight If you have to fly and don't like flying then Singapore Airlines is safe and pleasant.

I chose to fly overnight, and was lucky enough to get three seats together to myself. I was able to lie down and slept most of the flight, waking up in time for breakfast. The food was nice enough, I never have high expectations so as not to be disappointed. I recommend joing the rewards program Krissflyer for SIA if you intend flying frequently.",positive
3734,"Another excellent experience Flew business class as the return leg of our Russia - Europe holiday.  As usual, service was friendly and impeccable.  Most meals had been pre-ordered via Book the Cook and generally very tasty although the standard offerings also looked wonderful.  We choose Book the Cook as my wife has dietary requirements which are harder to meet with the standard offerings and are not given as a meal choice despite the very wide range of meal types offered by Singapore.  On previous flights her diet has been catered to after making specific requests to Singapore Airlines via e-mail but this was not necessary using Book the Cook.
We booked our seats very early and so were able to select bulkhead seats in the second (rear) cabin which have the full width foot recess.
Surprisingly on this flight I didn't find any of the large selection of movies that particularly appealed (I had already seen all those that did), but this is obviously a personal thing.",positive

1107,"Has to be one of the best airlines out there Pre-covid, my family and I used to travel back and forth from Perth to Johannesburg on a direct flight operated by South African Airways with a duration of around 11 hrs. Since a lot of flight paths are no longer being serviced one of the few options of travelling this route is to fly from Perth to Singapore (flight duration ~ 5 hrs), enjoy a 3 hour layover in the stunning Changi airport, and then fly from Singapore to Johannesburg (flight duration ~ 11 hrs). We travelled this route for the first time in Feb 2022 and I can honestly say it was such an enjoyable experience flying on Singapore Airlines. I have travelled on South African Airways, Air New Zealand, Air Asia, Qantas (as well as a few domestic only operated airlines) and none of them compare to the service offered on Singapore Airlines. Staff (from check-in to in-flight) are SO lovely and are happy to cater to your every need. Food is 10/10, especially since we pre-book Muslim meals and are usually quite underwhelmed on other airlines but Singapore Airlines meals was SOOOOO GOOD!  In-flight entertainment was also a plus and seats were comfortable and reclined quite a bit (yes even in economy!). Although the trip is longer without a direct flight, I am more than happy to book Singapore Airlines again and again. Overall, experience was 11/10. THANK YOU SINGAPORE AIRLINES FOR YOUR AMAZING SERVICE AND HOSPITALITY!",positive
9616,"Jakarta to Singapore Flight The flight was late arriving but in the end departed pretty close to the due time. Only a 1 hour 50 flight so not a major but did have a connection to make.

Asked on board re what gate and terminal we were arriving at as needed to get to T3 for next flight and was told you will have to wait and see not sure. Plane may not go without you one never knows. Thought this was not the best of answers really. I might also point out I am an Elite flyer with Star Alliance airlines and this made no difference at all. If fact they never even made mention of it. 
Flight was average but okay and again on landing asked if we could get off quickly and was told no you wait as we don't do that and sorry if you miss your flight.  The fact then many people pushed past me and a person travelling with me I felt was pretty poor from the airline.
Overall i have to say no what I would expect from this airline.
We did also have a medical situation on the flight and I have to say the crew all looked very panicked and not really fully in control of things thankfully it was not to much of a major.",neutral

When your flying suites or first you get access to a lounge exclusively for first class passengers and not priority card holders. 

This area is called the private room. Great sit down dining experience followed by the most relaxing sofas and chairs with a clear view of the aircrafts parked at the gates below. 

Once on board the aircraft you have the most spacious suites in the market on the worlds largest aircraft the A380. 

From the best wine and champagnes to fresh caviar served on board they really take care if their first class passengers. 

For a vegetarian that doesn’t drink I usually just drink water throughout the flight. The service staff really aims to please.

1) Very new product and finishes didn't look cheap

2) Middle rows had their overhead luggage storage removed so the whole cabin looked alot more spacious

3) There was ample space to get from the aisle to the seat unlike my previous flight on the 787 Dreamliner (there was a bit of a squeeze because of the way the hard shells of the seats are designed).

Check in was easy, very friendly service. I was particularly looking forward to experiencing the new A350's Singapore are servicing Brisbane with.

Due to Covid, the plane was very empty so we were able to have 2 rows of 3 seats to ourselves. We were able to spread out and have a great sleep on this leg.

I moved seats at one stage as the next door passenger was 'manspreading' and I couldn't even plug in the headset. When I moved I reclined the seat and was treated to a spray by the woman behind me. No, she wasn't eating, it was dark and the lights were dimmed!",neutral

3468,"Good But Not Great My partner and I are just back from a trip to Koh Samui, Thailand. We had flights from Perth to Singapore then Singapore to Samui and returned the same way... all booked through Singapore Airlines. However, the Singapore-Samui-Singapore legs were on Silk Air, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines.

Our experience with Singapore Airlines was very good. Booking tickets excellent. At the airport was excellent... luggage sent from departure to arrival points no problem... and aircraft crew were awesome as usual. 

The reason we give 4/5 and not 5/5 is this... we flew Perth-Singapore-Perth legs on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and this was our first time on these aircraft... and quite frankly these aircraft are nothing special.... in fact having no control over airflow from above your own head is poor... from Perth to Singapore the air conditioning was cold... but having a blanket was good.... But!! on the Singapore to Perth leg the cabin was stuffy and extremely warm which made us uncomfortable and my partner became unwell, having to ask for cold towels to cool down.

Also, between Perth and Singapore on Singapore Airlines there are no options for Premium Economy which is disappointing.

I really like Singapore Airlines but based on this I would definitely consider other airlines now.",positive
1253,"SIN SFO SIN during pandemic Had to fly to SFO during covid.

I changed my tickets three times, SIA was very accommodating, though charge some fees.

Changi airport: almost empty, quick check in, star alliance gold lounged closed, given access to Silverkris lounge. No buffet, make to order food served at table. Excellent service.

SFO-SIN: flight was delayed my 70min, was notified personally. We were about 20 people on board. Served 2 hot meals with all drink choices available. Snacks rounds were not done for covid safety, but snacks n drinks were kept at service area for self service.
Toilet was very very clean, and was cleaned after every single use.

SFO-SIN: empty airport, lounge closed, so given 25 USD/person to buy food drink at a Japanese restaurant near boarding gate. Only 6 passengers in the whole aircraft. Again served 2 hot meals and plenty of snacks offered. Before landing, crew in charge, mr Victor Lim offered a bag full of snacks water to take to our quarantine hotel.

7355,"Should have been an A380 ! We do love to fly with Singapore Airlines and have never had an issue at any level - always very professional all the way and Changi  is our favourite big airport.  
We booked the tickets for a trip from Melbourne to Koh Samui about 7 months in advance as a party of 6, flying Mel - Sin, and then Silk Air from Sin- USM.The first leg was on an A380 and seats were booked so were all together. About 6 weeks out we were informed that the aircraft was now a 777 and seats were allocated randomly to say the least. I know that it is the perjorative of the Airline to make changes without notice but it was pretty annoying given there was no apology or explanation.  Anyways, it was still a good flight- but still  a little like booking a Merc and being given a Skoda or even worst - Parma Regret. Would it stop us flying SA again ? Absolutely not !",positive
2074,"Decreasing Experience Have flown Singapore every year for more than 25 years to visit my folks in Oz and to travel onward to our chosen holiday destinations. Over the past few years we have noticed a slow, but sure reduction in the quality of the overall experience. 

For the main part, I guess attempts to cut costs and increase shareholder value are at the root of the problems, with every aspect of the customer experience being trimmed back to maximise profits. Quality of In-flight refreshments and meals are probably the most noticeable, with less food and drink being made available during long haul flights. 

Meals now consist of a small fruit starter, a main course and a bread roll. A desert generally consists of a small tub of ice cream (circa 100g), with no other option if you don't like ice cream. On our long-haul segment, there were 3 main course items listed on the menu, with only 2 available; when we enquired, the third item was not exhausted, it was just not available on the flight.

Additions such as salt and pepper, dressings, cheese and crackers are now non existent. The portions and quality of the main courses are also smaller and lesser, respectively. 

The trolley bar service has also been slashed. Where once you would as for a red or white wine you would be given a small plastic bottle from a selection laid out in the menu, now you receive a half of a plastic glass of either red or white, of no particular sweetness or dryness. It is also clear that the cabin staff are doing all they can to reduce opportunities for you to request a second round, or top up. Probably the hardest thing to swallow (non pun etc.) is the fact that if you wish to have a tea or coffee after your meal, then it appears that you are actually asking for additional drinks (the cabin crew now ask if you want tea or coffee at the start of the meal when they are doing the bar service). The whole bar experience makes leaves you feeling ""economised"" and plays on your conscience when asking for anything outside of the norm.

There are many other areas that have been impacted that could be mentioned, but they are far more subtle. Key amongst them though are a reduction in the level of staffing on long haul flights, which has a knock on effect on the attention and service levels being given by the cabin staff. The Singapore Girl of yesteryear is no longer to be seen, instead replaced with a hurried young man/woman who is primarily focused on getting service completed ASAP.

Whilst my review may be considered a little subjective, I would point out one thing; year on year Singapore Airlines have raised there fares for my standard LHR-PER-LHR trip. This time around we paid GBP 1799 each for economy seats. This is no small amount of money, it is not a ""low-cost"" option nor is it a cheap fare for a non top-tier airline. It is a significant amount of money to invest to observe ever diminishing standards. 

It's such a shame to see SIA going this way and it will be a hard lesson learned for the organisation. The levels of service available from other airlines (such as Emirates & Cathay) are ever increasing, representing much improved value for money and an excellent customer experience. Going forward I will certainly be giving other options a go prior to remaining blindly loyal on the basis of past glories.",neutral

Between 2000 and 2005, I had to make use of the London and Singapore ticket offices, which I can only describe as being hopeless at best.
During a check-in in 2005 in NZ, I was asked by the check-in supervisor what my opinion was of the airline, so I indicated the excellent airport & flight experience and said it was completely let down by the ticket offices. The supervisor gave me a business card and asked me to email direct going forward.
So from 2005 to the end of March 2020, all was well.
In March 2020, all the staff were let go, which meant a return to using London & Singapore. This is an even bigger disaster than it was back in 2000-2005.
Despite having cancelled $20,000 worth of tickets, they have been completely unhelpful. They won't re-book anything without additional $3000+ per ticket (even though this is illegal in some of my countries of origin).

9681,"It gets old... I have been taking Singapore Airlines every time I go to India, over the years I have noticed the degradation of service... It used to be outstanding to the point that you’ll run out of good things to say but based on my recent flight, the magic is gone. Maybe because they get used to the praises that they became complacent. Or maybe, change of management?

The flight crews became transactional, the fleets from MNL to SIN and SIN to MAA need updating, the seats and entertainment system needs to be cleaned and sanitized.

I am hoping that this airline revives its glory.

For now, I am neutral if I will continue taking this flight or shift airline.",neutral
7064,"One has to be better than all the rest Singapore Airlines knows how to put it together from ""Book the Cook"" to great onboard service and a very clean and comfortable plane. The cabin crew are great and you feel the flight crew are always in control. The AV is great with up to date movies etc. Check in is always a breeze with decent baggage allowances,",positive
6233,Where were friendliness and smiles on board? It was the worst on board experience I have had with Singapore Airlines for the past several years I flew this route.  I missed the smiles and friendliness I enjoyed on board the previous flights.,negative

9659,"No refunding of accommodation due to missing of the connection flight In the beginning of January 2018 I flew from Jacksonville to Frankfurt via JFK airport in N.Y. The first flight operated by a partner airline had a 7 hours delay, so that I missed the connection flight from N.Y. to Frankfurt. As landed in JFK airport no representative of Singapore Airlines (SA) was available at the airport. Next flight was 24 hours later. Alone I had to organize my overnight stay in New York in a hotel. After submitting all documents to SA immediately after my return to Germany, it took for SA 7 months to decide on this case. Finally, they rejected my request to refund accommodation costs in N.Y. city arguing that the delay of the first flight was due to bad weather conditions. This is a very poor performance of Singapore Airlines.",negative
6794,"Excellent service Singapore Airlines offers excellent service, reasonably good food and a good range of entertainment options. Cabin staff are friendly and helpful but I have major issues with their website which is hard to navigate and not always up to date. I usually end up phoning them and have more success that way.",positive
7624,"knowing you are in good hand is the most important SQ now is not like SQ when I was young but at least food and courtesy is still well maintained. Cabin looks tired as well as the seat, some toilets struggle to show its shine. Overall, safety and punctuality is the most important especially for business traveler",positive
6222,Not as expected  I was looking forward to flying with Singapore airlines. Boarding was ok and the plane was older but clean. The seats were good but expected a bit more padding on the seats given the price. Legroom however was good. I had a special meal which was served an hour before everyone else which was ok. The flight itself was quite turbulent. Some of the flight attendants were polite but others were not. They did offer frequent drinks and kept us hydrated. Why do they insist the window blinds be kept down nearly the whole flight its beyond me. Arrived on time. The experience was good but did expect more from them given they were the best voted airline. Hoping my return journey will be better,neutral

1850,"Usual high standard Second time I’ve flown with Singapore airlines and is always my preferred airline when travelling to Australia. Meals served were edible,  plenty of refreshments available and as always attentive staff. Can not fault Singapore’s airlines, wish I could afford to go business class 😃 the only comment I have is that when you have paid and selected your seat if you want to change then you have to pay again, so I would select your seat just prior to travelling.",positive
3936,Holiday First time I've travelled with Singapore Airlines. From check in everything was to a very high standard. Flight attendants were very helpful and professional. Food excellent and plenty of choice. Came round throughout the long flight with drinks and snacks. Entertainment was excellent plenty of choice. Would recommend the airline. Would travel with them again.,positive
1641,"Best Airline Recently travelled from Australia to Sri Lanka with a stop over in Singapore. Could not fault the airline service. Staff were friendly. Food was great. Nice to be greeted with a warm face cloth upon boarding. Toilets were always kept clean. Seats are comfortable and great selection of movies. 
Only thing I would say is that I thought the airline would provide antibacterial wipes etc or hand sanitiser due to recent outbreak and this was not supplied.",positive
8,"Very bad, disappointed Respected Faculty, I am Bincy, writing this  to file a complaint regarding a cancellation of the connection flight of Singapore airlines and the irresponsible service from Singapore airlines airport staff members at Singapore .My parents 67 yr old Dad as 63 yr old Mom travelled from Brisbane airport in Singapore airlines  SQ236 yesterday at 14.45 hrs and arrived at Singapore airport at 20.25hrs yesterday late evening. Then only they were informed that the connection flight SQ 536 which was booked and  confirmed, has got cancelled and they have to wait until next day night. This was not informed to us in any form of communication. 
And secondly, though my parents are very older with so many health issues, (my parents are Diabetic also, taking insulin and my parents have high blood pressure, taking medications)but they had to wait in airport in a chair without any support for 24 hours without any food especially when they are from a non English speaking background. The mental stress and physical discomforts for 24 hours they were gone through are unimaginable and we cannot express it to the full extent. They didn't get any emotional or physical support from staffs at Singapore airport.They didn't arrange any room to rest or any proper lounge and not even any food for 24 hours (my parents were not prepared to stay at airport for more than 4 hours as  we booked the tickets with least transit time at Singapore airport)
We had a trust in the services of Singapore airlines, and so we booked the flight for our parents with much confidence. 
We booked the tickets through an agency Sanjo travels in India but we got the confirmation that Singapore airlines didn't inform the agency as well. So it's completely the mistake from Singapore Airlines.",negative
4180,It felt like 1st class even in economy Plenty of leg room. Very attentive staff. The food was the best airline food i have ever tasted. I am Vegetarian and the food was tasty and spicy and imaginative. More movies to choose from and plenty of drinks both alcholic and  and non alcholic .,positive
4727,"Excellent airline and lovely staff A lovely airline,the staff made our long journey more tolerable,always pleasant and with a smile. Would always recommend them.food was good and the Singapore slings went down a treat.",positive
