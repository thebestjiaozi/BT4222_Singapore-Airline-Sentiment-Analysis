2023-09-17,8,8,"""a very good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Check-in and boarding in Penang were smooth. The lounge in Penang was quite ordinary but completely adequate. On board, the window seat was very comfortable, though storage was limited. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal hadn't been loaded, so I was given a very bready pizza from Economy class. At Changi the Singapore Business lounge in Terminal 3 was vastly superior to those of most airlines, even when crowded. The process of boarding the A380 was smooth. The seat was comfortable and converted into a good bed, but a little tight around the feet. My vegetarian meal was delicious. The number of toilets in the Business section was limited, and there were Economy-type queues in the morning. The luggage was available quickly. Overall a very good experience."
2023-09-17,8,8,"""a very pleasant journey""","✅ Trip Verified | At Melbourne airport the check-in was very quick and friendly, and the lounge was pleasant and had a good selection of food and drink. Onboard the cabin crew was welcoming, and the seat on the B777 was very comfortable with adequate storage though the diagonal arrangement for lying flat was awkward. No amenities kit was provided. The quality of the vegetarian meals was way above that of other airlines. The flight arrived in Singapore a little early and transfer to a nearby gate for the second leg to Japan leaving in 70 minutes was easy. The boarding process was efficient, and the crew on the B787 were also welcoming and the seat was comfortable (not diagonal for sleeping), though storage space was more limited. The flight arrived on time and luggage was available quickly. All in all a very pleasant journey."
2023-09-16,10,10,"""Unbelievable devotion to service!""","✅ Trip Verified | I cannot speak highly enough of the superlative service received on this flight. After I lost one earbud deep down into my seat the crew were determined to retrieve it for me - the lovely hostess thrust her wrist into the seat workings and fished out my earbud, sustaining some pain and minor abrasion. Unbelievable devotion to service! Every other aspect of the crew's service was impeccable as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines - I have just flown Economy Class from London to Singapore and the service was fabulous on that flight as well. I am writing this review on in-flight wi-fi - seems to be working fine, for the first time in my experience."
2023-09-15,10,10,"""always great new planes""","Not Verified | As always great new planes, friendly service, lots of legroom. On time every time, staff extremely helpful, and even in economy food very good. We will always where possible fly Singapore Airlines. Thank you you are a big part of our holidays."
2023-09-15,10,10,"""experience was second to none""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have just flown SQ256 from Brisbane to Singapore and the experience was second to none with outstanding cabin crew. Well done SQ,"
2023-09-14,2,2,"""premium price for economy quality""","Not Verified | Premium economy in Singapore Airlines is terrible. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the food is the same as economy and there is no separate toilet in the PE cabin (only the economy toilets). We had to ask for a bottle of water, there was no amenity kit and when we asked for socks, the kit we received contained socks and a toothbrush (no toothpaste). The staff were nice but premium economy is simply a premium price for economy quality. Next time I need to go to Europe, I'll look to transit through the US rather than Singapore."
2023-09-12,10,10,"""served a lovely dinner""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ227 in Economy. Booked in April. Fare was Starting at $1600.00USD, luckily I was able to use my mileage for this trip. Gate opened right on time, with Cabin Crew going through Security after me. I boarded last, and was welcomed aboard. Crew made comments on my Attaché, saying ""You look like 007"", and other nice touches. One asked ""I like that! Is that A Rimowa?"" Nice to see SQ crew attentive, with small touches. Cabin jammed, Had to go around to get to my seat. I sat 62G, and had no Overhead Bin. So I had to use another one. Throughout the flight nobody disturbed my stuff. Luckily my Attaché fit under the seat. Also there is only 1 Lavatory in the rear of the Aircraft. We got served a lovely dinner. I noticed one of the Female crew members, was in a Suit. Flying with SQ since 2008, had me pondered. After the meal I engaged her in some conversation. She said ""I am a Flight Auditor. Do you have any Feedback Sir?'. I didn't tell her about the appallingly horrific SQ check in at FRA, but maybe I should have. I settled in to sleep. One of the Cabin Attendants asked me if I wanted an aid to cover my eyes, but I said no, and I flew asleep. Woke up 90 minutes out, and was served refreshment. Multiple coffee rounds commenced, with crew approaching sleeping passengers for Refreshment. Landed MEL, with announcements on Luggage coming out late, however no SQ Ground Staff at the Luggage Carousel. If I go to Australia again, I would definitely fly Singapore Airlines."
2023-09-08,10,10,"""Exceptionally shine""","✅ Trip Verified | World's Longest Commercial Flight, in Premium Economy Solo Seat. Bought Tickets in April. SQ Counter at EWR rather late to open, however incoming aircraft arrived late. Staff didn't know final destination, and I had to help them. No bother, as they appreciated it, and checked my Rimowa through. Cabin Crew arrived 40 minutes before boarding time. Ground staff again were novice, and boarding was kind of ""rough"" due to misplaced announcements. I was the last to board. Upon boarding was greeted throughout my walk to my seat. One Attendant even asked where I was going, smiled, and got out of the way. SQ Premium Economy Solo Seat so comfortable, and side bin holds so much. Took off on time, to a lovely sunny day. Had to use the Lavatory, and had to wait, because a Cabin Attendant was cleaning it. She noticed me, and expedited her clean. On IFE the ""Old is Gold"" section is gone, but a excess of Old movies were available, and I watched Star Wars. A drink run commenced, then Lunch. When they arrived for Lunch, the Attendant Instantly apologized, and said they only had 1 meal type however, however promised multiple options later. So I went ahead, and had it. Was tasty, followed my Ice Cream, and another drink round. I dozed off, and woke up over Denmark. Went to use the Lavatory again, however it was again being cleaned. Snack/drink runs were conducted. Really appreciate the crew on the details. Had the second meal of Iraq/Iran. I had the Seafood option. Was exceptional, hot too symphony of flavors. More drink runs followed. I dozed off again, and woke up with a Made in Italy pocket Pizza next to me. Landed SIN, to a beautiful evening. Once again SQ21, SQ23 Exceptionally shine."
2023-09-02,3,3,"""seats are hard and uncomfortable""",Inflight entertainment selection is poor…and meals are poor compared to other airlines. The leather seats are hard and uncomfortable. The amenities bag is rubbish - no socks and no eye mask.
2023-08-29,10,10,"""professional and comfortable""",Not Verified | We flew with Singapore to New York for the first time and were very pleased. Everything was professional and comfortable. The staff helped us with everything. Nothing to complain about.
2023-08-29,1,1,"""they’ve begun to nose-dive""","Not Verified | My partner is a student, and we’re in the process of moving her home, we called to add her student Kris-Flyer account to her ticket and they confirmed over the phone they did, and that they left a note and that they unfortunately couldn’t send email confirmation - despite our requests. The ground crew were asking for email confirmation and attempted to charge us 600+ euros for the extra weight (€60/kg) despite our allowance supposedly covering this. Then the ground crew advised us to pay now and attempt to claim later (which in a previous experience which costed me €2000 didn’t get me any return) We turned up 4 hours before our flight. It’s been 2 while being on hold again for another hour to get re-confirmation. If you value you your time more than this avoid them if you can, pre-covid, Singapore was best in class. Now they’ve begun to nose-dive."
2023-08-23,7,7,"""offered 100 dollars full settlement""","Not Verified | I have always had a good cabin experience with Singapore and been a Gold Member for decades. However a recent baggage issue has left me gobsmacked by their tardiness and callous behaviour. Landed in SIN on a stopover and noticed my Delsey case (only 12kg total check in) had a 6 inch case fracture. I reported it and received a case number. On arriving into Cairns the next day, there was no customer service representative visible so I could not pursue the matter. After calling SQ in Singapore after 3 weeks I was finally emailed by a local representative who saw the bag damage photos and offered 100 dollars full settlement for a new bag worth 400 dollars. The experience has let me reconsider any future SQ travel plans."
2023-08-21,5,5,"""Baggage handling was very poor""",✅ Trip Verified | Baggage handling was very poor. My new suitcase was very badly handled. All 4 wheels were broken and pulling handle was jammed. Upon lodging complaint they simply said this is caused by routine handling and airline can do nothing about it. This was very bad and was not expected from an airline among top airlines of the world.
2023-08-21,9,9,"""We had a wonderful crew""","Not Verified | We had a wonderful crew, especially Singapore to Zurich SQ346 17/7/23 with Marissa, Celeste, Joanne and Scarlet who looked after us wonderfully. They attended to all our needs with no fuss. Thankyou."
2023-08-13,10,10,"""The service was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | The service was excellent. Very impressed to see Singapore Airlines continuing to be one of my favourite airlines to travel with. The meals were excellent, inflight entertainment was excellent, and the cleanliness in the washrooms were perfect on both of my flights. It is always wonderful travelling with Singapore Airlines and will always continue to use the airline for future travels! Way to go Singapore Airlines!"
2023-08-09,10,10,"""outstanding customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines impressed me with their outstanding customer service. Despite the unfortunate incident of my stolen passport, they rebooked my flight twice at no cost, showing exceptional flexibility and support. Their quick responses, transparent communication, and genuine care for passengers make them a top choice for hassle-free travel. Kudos to Singapore Airlines for turning a potentially disastrous situation into a shining example of world-class service."
2023-08-09,6,6,"""Overall not a bad flight""","Not Verified |  My flight arrive late which cause a 50 minute delay. Overall not a bad flight. Food was tasty, seat were comfortable and the best inflight entertainment and they are trying to do their best to make up for the delay. On my return flight a 1hour 10 minute delay m. Also not a bad flight. It was the same as my other flight."
2023-08-03,10,10,"""way better than other airlines""","Not Verified | This year we have returned to fly with Singapore Airlines after some years of absence. No regrets! The service, food and everything is way better than other airlines we flew with, including Emirates last year (gluten-free meals on Singapore Airlines are very tasty, unlike Emirates GF meals). Impeccable service that caters for all the needs and even whims of passengers, including my request for a slice of lemon for my tea (the Polish way), which Nadine fullfilled with ease and a smile on the SQ325 flight on 16 July 2023. God bless you, Nadine!"
2023-07-22,9,9,"""Great service and food""","Not Verified | Thank you to the crew of Chis, Fred, Shin Ru, Mabel, Fhri and Gui Fang. A long time since I have traveled with Singapore Airlines and they are amazing. Great service and food. Extremely comfortable seating."
2023-07-19,1,1,"""by far the worst customer service""",Not Verified | Singapore Airlines still has not reimbursed me for my lost bags back in early January. After fighting them for months they finally agreed to give me some money for losing my stuff. They approved it back on May 18th. They said please allow a month for final approval. Here it is July 17th and still nothing. Singapore Airlines has by far the worst customer service I have ever seen. Please do not fly Singapore Airlines.
2023-07-17,9,9,"""Service was excellent as expected""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ Silver Kris Lounge in Changi T3 was as good as normal, with excellent food choices and good seating. The flight itself was uneventful, despite a slight delay on departure. The flight was quite bumpy for sometime over Japan, which was expected and announced by the captain. Though this had nothing to do with the airline, I realized that American carriers tend to change route and altitude when encountering turbulence, while Asian carriers seem just to go through that, and I experienced that quite consistently. I ordered my meals through book-the-cook, and the Boon Tong Kee chicken rice was underwhelming, while the lobster thermidor was nice. Service was excellent as expected. Wi-fi was complementary for J passengers, and it worked quite well."
2023-07-16,6,6,"""not as good I was expecting""","Not Verified | I was looking forward very much to the experience on Singapore Airlines, and even more so, the A380. I was in the bulkhead seat in Premium Economy, so the very first row on the lower level. It was a nice smooth flight, The IFE was adequate, But I was a little disappointed with the level of service. I've always heard about how attentive ""The Singapore Girl"" (ie.flight attendants on SQ) were The service was far from the worst I have ever had on an airline, but not as good as I anticipated. Maybe I was comparing it to the absolute best service I have ever had on an airline I flew on my last overseas flight, a Taipei-based airline. Don't get me wrong, It was not bad at all - just not as good I was expecting."
2023-07-09,2,2,"""ask my wife to do it by herself""","✅ Trip Verified | We had this unpleasant experience while flying with Singapore Airline SQ 622 on July 9th, 2023 at 13:55 from SIN to KIX airport. One of the staff at the plane door who supposed to help my wife to cover the baby stroller with a plastic bag refused to do the job with ours and ask my wife to do it by herself. We saw him covered other's baby stroller with a plastic bag in front of our eyes but refused to do the same thing with ours. This is unacceptable and very rude."
2023-07-04,10,10,"""I was pleasantly surprised""","✅ Trip Verified | My first time on a Singapore Airlines flight and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gluten free meals offered, the variety of inflight entertainment, the excellence of service, the continuous cleanliness of the toilets and just the overall ease of boarding, flying and of course the airport!"
2023-06-28,8,8,"""In-flight service was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | We did not receive much assistance on the Noi Bai side, but it was good on the Changi side on arrival. The Song Hong Lounge was decent, with good food and nice view of the apron. Singapore Airlines used an A350-900 for a 3-hour flight, which was amazing. Our book-the-cook meals were decent, though not as good as I would like. In-flight service was excellent."
2023-06-27,9,9,"""really nice for a sub 2-hour flight""","✅ Trip Verified | The Silver Kris Lounge at SIN T3 was big and nice. However, finding good seating during peak time was still challenging. The lounge offered good selection of food including Western, Chinese and local options. The flight was on SQ regional A350-900, which has similar flatbed seats as other premium airlines' long-haul equipment. That was really nice for a sub 2-hour flight. In-flight food service was very nice for such a short flight."
2023-06-27,7,7,"""In-flight service was quite nice""","✅ Trip Verified | I was supposed to fly on SQ25 to Singapore via Frankfurt. The flight was canceled after we are at the gate for 4 hours past the departure time without any explanation. Being flown with SQ for many times, I suspect this had to do with JFK rather than the airline. However, they should still bear the responsibility for addressing to their customers. We were rebooked to the non-stop SQ23 to Singapore the following day. We ended up on the A350-900XLR, which was quite nice, but I still prefer their A380. Due to the flight change, we did not get our book the cook meals. In-flight service was quite nice as expected from SQ."
2023-06-23,2,2,"""needed a GF Vegan meal""","Not Verified | When booking my flight I advised the travel agent I am a coeliac so need a gluten free diet, but I also have allergies to dairy and egg, so needed a GF Vegan meal, thinking this would be the easier option. When I boarded the flight was advised I could have either the GF meal or the Vegan. As the GF had dairy in it was not suitable, and the Vegan has gluten in. They advised me to contact the staff at the airline when I arrived to organise the return flights. I had fruit which the lovely cabin crew sourced from business class and a bag of potato chips. I contacted our travel agent to be informed I was listed for the GF vegan meals. So contacted Singapore airlines, the person I spoke to said it was not acceptable that I needed a combination of the two they only dealt with one allergy per person! I would need a Drs certificate if I had to have it. He then told me to take my own food. Which I ended up doing, but the amount of room available on the plane is minimal and awkward to get to bags when you’re elderly. Again the crew managed to source some fruit for me."
2023-06-20,6,6,"""not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs""","✅ Trip Verified | I find it appalling that SA’s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didn’t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the child’s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that it’s not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs and they shouldn’t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed."
2023-06-16,5,5,"""Worst business class seats""",✅ Trip Verified | Worst business class seats. Why does SQ still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body? And the transition from bed to sitting is NOT a button push. Rather: Get out of seat. Flip seat with handles. Get back into seat/bed.
2023-06-16,7,7,"""They still have high standards""","Not Verified | I flew to Singapore from London Heathrow in economy class on the SQ319 Airbus A380. Flight left and arrived on time. The positives: Flight crew were pleasant, friendly and polite. They still have high standards and give you a lovely welcome when you arrive onboard. Seats were fairly comfortable and enough space to stow your belongings and move around the cabin. Was given a sleeping pillow and a blanket. Negatives: Singapore Airlines have cut the quality and diversity of food and drinks that they have on offer. It was not the standard of food previously experienced on SQ flights. Presentation not good - now just mediocre. No juice, water or alcoholic beverages offered when you first get on the plane. No menu. Toilets weren’t clean and very small. You no longer get an amenity kit with toothbrush, eye shades, ear plugs, or socks or a newspaper. Bring back the hot towel service."
2023-06-12,6,6,"""seats were hard and uncomfortable""","Not Verified | We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we won’t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad."
2023-06-09,9,9,"""special praise for Air Stewardess""","✅ Trip Verified | I would like to give special praise for Air Stewardess Nurul who served me at the Premium Economy cabin. She has been very proactive in asking and suggesting drinks and snacks to eat throughout the trip. Very friendly , good listener and very conversant."
2023-06-07,2,2,"""another 6 weeks for the refund""","Not Verified | Not such a great way to fly. I booked an air ticket and the flight departure timing was brought forward by 7 hours. We had the option to accept, reschedule or cancel to get a refund. I chose the third option but was put thru multiple individuals who do not seem to know what they are doing (each contradicting the other) but eventually, I received an email to say the refund was being processed and it would take 6 weeks. Well, it was the 6th week yesterday and I wrote in to enquire, only to be told they will be processing it now. Today I received another email (a proper refund notice this time) to say it will be another 6 weeks for the refund to come thru."
2023-06-01,6,6,"""rather disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom)."
2023-05-30,9,9,"""a very nice experience""",✅ Trip Verified | I flew with SQ to and from Auckland on the A 350 - 6 May and 22 May. Both flights were a very nice experience. All flight crew very pleasant and helpful and an especial thanks to Edward - senior flight crew on the outward bound flight from Auckland to Singapore. He epitomised the high standards the SQ expect from their staff. Seats fairly comfortable but slightly awkward layout in the lie flat mode with foot well at an angle. I ordered book the cook and the meals were delicious apart from the Thai Red curry served on the Auckland Singapore leg which was reminiscent of boarding school stew with no flavour. Toilet cleanliness maintained to a high standard. However on both legs the sleeping pillow smelled sour. I am sure the pillow cases were clean but the actual pillows require regular washing as well. Please bring back the hot towel service .
2023-05-30,7,7,"""provided the very best""","✅ Trip Verified | From start to finish, the service, food, and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback."
2023-05-30,10,10,"""The suite very comfortable""",✅ Trip Verified | Suites on the A380 are in terms of comfort and layout 100% better than on the SQ 777 although the high standard of service remains the same for both aircraft. Lovely welcome from the staff and the cabin crew are exceptionally well presented in grooming and demeanour. I also am appreciative that I was addressed by my title and surname as I am of that older generation that appreciates such niceties. The suite very comfortable and lovely to have a seperate bed. The two bathrooms are spacious with many amenities and the food glorious. A very special thank you to senior flight crew Tasha (from Indonesia) who was so friendly and epitomised all that is excellent with SQ and also to Kelvin whom I think was the flight manager.
2023-05-29,5,5,"""totally disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | The A380 layout is nice in appearance, but I have never experienced a business class seat that requires you to lay at an angle in order to use the footrest space. The seats were the hardest I have ever encountered in business class & very uncomfortable. My seat on my outbound or return flights operated properly and I had to call for flight attendant assistance numerous times when the seat buttons simply failed to work. No amenity kits were provided, which was a 1st for any business class flight I have experienced. You had to request eye shades, ear plugs or slippers, with razors, combs, toothbrushes etc. available in the restrooms. It was a significant time after boarding before any drinks were served but it was only juice or water & no champagne was offered. Food in both directions were mediocre at best. Wine offerings were insulting, flight attendants pour no more than 2"" into the small glasses, since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made. The Cabin Staff were polite, courteous & professional, but not nearly as service oriented as Qatar or many other 5-Star airlines. We found it quite telling that SG used the Air India Lounge for their business class passengers at JFK, even though Air India is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines Worldwide. At least at FRA they used Air Canada's Lounge which was a major improvement, but there was zero preference for business class passengers at FRA boarding. Overall, we found them to be totally disappointing and it failed to deliver the same quality business class service I have had on many other carriers."
2023-05-28,1,1,"""my luggage was damaged""","✅ Trip Verified | Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. Upon arrival, I noticed my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag I can use. I've indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this."
2023-05-26,1,1,"""Compensation should have been upgrade""","✅ Trip Verified | Left 2.5 hours late and we almost missed our Singapore Airlines connecting Flight as the Skyrail between terminals was not working and we had 25 mins to get from terminal 1 to Terminal 3. When we arrived at the gate we were told to go to, By Singapore Airlines Sign as we Departed our flight. The gate was shut. We found out by a passerby that the gate changed 2.5 hours previously and was now another 10 mins further on, we made it but our luggage did not. We got on plane to find we were seated separately. We booked in with staff together & we arrived together. We got to Manchester and were told luggage would be about 4 days. on the 5th day we went to the Airport 2 hours later we emerged hopeful & our baggage arrived on the 6th Day only to find the suitcase with missing roller & damaged. We had to use our own money to buy underware, toiletries, clothes for 2 people & a suitcase. This will be refunded but in the meantime we had to use our own money. I get to the airport to fly out this morning & there is no register of my Vegetarian meal on departing flight and I did enter it at the same time I did the previous flight. We lost 1/3 of our holiday 100% due to delays. We were allowed to go to the Business Class lounge on the way out as compensation, I should be grateful for Vegetarian Sausages before I leave & a glass of Wine. Compensation should have been upgrade to business class. We paid extra Premium Economy as we thought it would be more comfortable and relaxing but couldn't have been worse."
2023-05-26,2,2,"""Very poor service""",✅ Trip Verified | Very poor service from flight attendants. There was no menu and couldn’t understand what the attendants were offering for a meal because of the mask. Food was served few hours into flight. Wine selection was bad. Never saw the flight attendant after the first meal on an 18 hour flight Was woken up 8 hours into flight to ask if I needed lunch Never saw the flight attendant after that. No toiletries provided.
2023-05-22,8,8,"""Service and crew were excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Always loved Singapore Airlines and flew them in all classes many many times. On this occasion flew them on a night flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Aircraft got switched from an A350 onto A380 on the day and generally that is a great thing, as always love an A380. However my bulk head seat was not the same/good option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard, so not the most comfortable to sleep in. In that regard prefer the A350/777 and the older A380s much more! I ordered a Gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible. Which is a shame. Breakfast was fine however. Service and crew were excellent as usual."
2023-05-22,5,5,"""Cabin staff didn't seem very happy""","✅ Trip Verified | HND-SIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didn't seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the 'online check in' queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a 'touch and go' landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable. Wi-Fi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board, which I couldn't because I'd already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction?"
2023-05-22,4,4,"""not recommend this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future."
2023-05-20,4,4,"""wide ranging cost cutting exercise""",✅ Trip Verified | What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses. Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasn’t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.
2023-05-14,4,4,"""the service and staff was mediocre""","✅ Trip Verified | It's been a long while since I've flown Singapore Airlines, and they've consistently received accolades for their service, even in Economy Class. However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where I've seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning). Check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport (but this may be as I have priority status). But overall, very disappointed with how the quality of service of a reputable airline has declined so much."
2023-05-12,10,10,"""helpful, courteous and polite""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ38 SIN-LAX on May 9th on a 359. This is the longest leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight is full, mostly with couples and single travelers. In Singapore there is another security check at the waiting room gate, and most travelers didn't realize they have to go through it to go to the waiting room. Many of the these are the infrequent or first time travelers who don't know that they have to scan their electronics and take off their belts jackets and caps off again, making a long line that moved very slow. Boarding was done by zone and was quite orderly, however there was still a line of latecomers going through the waiting room gate check when the boarding begins. This makes the flight have to leave 25 minutes later than scheduled. The FAs were all wearing masks as per their company's precaution and safety awareness policy. However they were all still very friendly, personable, helpful, courteous and polite, and dedicated in giving their best service. The service started as soon as we reached cruising altitude, started with a drink service then dinner, and a second drink service after that. Many of the travelers are Indians so the FAs quickly ran out of the vegetarian meal option that my Hubby was interested in and he had to settle for chicken with pasta, which is very good. After dinner the lights were turned off so people can sleep, but we were told that snacks is available in between the dinner and lunch that will be served 2 hours prior to landing. The cockpit crew communicated well, explaining about the flight plan before we leave and updating us of LAX condition before our descent. They were very good in identifying possible turbulence ahead so we always get notifications to fasten our seat belts before it hits. Restrooms were always kept clean and the FA frequently refresh them with deodorizer. The entertainment system is amazing and full of latest movies as usual, and it's hard to pick and choose what you want to watch next. As with our previous SQ flight, this aircraft has large 11"" touchscreen with a USB ""A"" that works, and the headphone plug requires two prongs, however it still works well with my wireless headphone adapter which only has one plug. The seat slides forward as you recline so it is a better position to get some rest in a semi reclining position. The lights were turned on just before drink service and lunch was served, and the FAs worked hard to serve us and get everything done before we start our descent into LAX. We arrived at LAX 1 hour ahead of schedule thanks to the strong tailwind. During a bathroom break I casually mentioned to one of the FAs that the day before was my birthday and this trip is to celebrate both our birthdays and our 10 years anniversary. After lunch suddenly we were given two cakes with two glasses of champagne with a ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate, and a card from the crew! Wow, I didn't see that coming! Shout out to all SQ38 crews on May 9th 2023! Thank you for your kindness and gifts!"
2023-05-12,10,10,"""another great flight with SQ""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ937 DPS-SIN on 05/09/23 as first leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their company's safety awareness effort. The cockpit crew gave information about the flight plans before we leave and current Singapore condition just before we start our descent, and we arrived just 10 minutes behind schedule. Overall this is another great flight with SQ."
2023-05-11,10,10,"""cabin crew truly went above and beyond""","✅ Trip Verified | Despite some allegations of cost-cutting measures surfacing across the internet and social media, Singapore Airlines is still unequivocally and undeniably the best in its class. In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless. Flying in Singapore Airlines on a premium cabin is truly and quite literally a heavenly experience at 40,000ft in the sky."
2023-05-06,2,2,"""50 minutes for the priority baggage""","✅ Trip Verified | This was a very bad experience, as the service quality of Singapore Airlines has noticeably declined. I couldn't understand why the flight was delayed for 40 minutes due to late passengers. While Singapore Airlines uses environmentally friendly cutlery on its short-haul flights the quantity of food served has been reduced. The unbearable thing for me was that I am a Gold member of Star Alliance, but on arrival to Denpasar I had to wait for 50 minutes for the priority baggage of this flight. The plane arrived at the gate at 21:07, but it was already 22:00 when I got my luggage. Finally, although the entertainment system interface was very nice, there were not many good movies and music options for me."
2023-05-04,4,4,"""late by up to 90 mins""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight I had with Singapore Airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival. It’s inferior to Qatar Airways business class : underwhelming lounges, okay onboard catering, no dining-on-demand, quirky flat-bed seats (on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380), meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways."
2023-05-02,8,8,"""revitalise the quality of inflight meals""","✅ Trip Verified | 22 April flight from SG to Seattle. In all my experience flying with Singapore Airlines, this was the first time I saw more stewards than stewardesses on board. While the cabin crew service was excellent as usual, I would like to give a special shout out and thanks to Cheryl, Jessica and Crystal for their top notch service that is befitting of the Singapore Girl name. On the contrary, the inflight meal was a disappointment. From the menu selection and food quality to the presentation, they are not fit to be served on board an airline as prestigious as Singapore Airlines. The pandemic is over. It's time to revitalise the quality of your inflight meals."
2023-04-28,10,10,"""a really great crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Used Singapore Airlines in economy from Bali to Bangkok via SIN, check in was done quickly using my FF status, security and passport control took around 30 minutes. I used the premier lounge which is okay for a coffee, boarding from gate 4A was organised, I had seat 58A which is an exit row so pretty comfortable, departed on time for the 2 hour 20 minute flight. Once in the air lunch served which is the regional boxed meal, I think it's a great idea for short flights, food was good served by a really great crew. Arrived SIN little bit early I had to transfer from T3 to T2 which is no problem even had time to visit the Krisflyer Gold Lounge for a coffee and be at the gate for my connection. Boarding quickly done and departed on time I found seat 56A fine, again a boxed regional meal served by a proactive crew on this 2 hour flight. Arrived just about on time, bags delivered quickly I was out in the taxi queue within 30 minutes."
2023-04-28,3,3,"""refused to offer me any compensation""","✅ Trip Verified |  My flight on 14 March 2023 was scheduled to depart SFO at 9:30am, but was delayed due to heavy winds. Understandable. Less understandable was the disorganized response, which included vague instructions on updates, a lack of transparency on continued delays after weather cleared. The flight departed late and I was told that my luggage would be on my connecting flight, but when I landed in HKG it was not. When I contacted SIA they refused to offer me any compensation for my delayed flight, and asked for an e-ticket number for my original Scoot ticket (e-ticket numbers are nowhere to be found on Scoot ticket receipts or in the booking on the app, which disappears after your flight date). Everything they did to help was simply a deflection of responsibility."
2023-04-23,9,9,"""This airline is worth the money""","Not Verified | This airline is worth the money every time we have flown with them. The staff always moving around the cabin when it is semi dark as some people are not asleep, offering drinks or snacks to keep up the enjoyment of flying. The food from Brisbane is a big improvement from June 2022 but the food on the return Singapore to Brisbane was a let down with cold and tough beef and two rude female cabin staff but otherwise great service on all flights. We had to fly Emirates Airline from Mumbai to Johannesburg and this airline needs to look how Singapore Business Class is five star."
2023-04-21,9,9,"""SQ are still up with the best""","✅ Trip Verified | Used Singapore Airlines between Cape Town & Bali, check in at CPT very quick and polite as was security and immigration. SQ use the Bidvest lounge which was fine with decent food and seating, boarding was covered quickly so soon at my seat 12A. Once onboard drinks served before departing on time. This flight makes a short stop in Johannesburg where passengers remain on the aircraft, a small lunch served on the first leg by a nice crew. With a new crew departed JNB on time for the 10 hour flight to Singapore, food lunch/breakfast and service during the flight very good as was the seat and TV Options. Arrival in Singapore a little early after a pretty bumpy flight, transfer was fine using the Silverkris lounge in T3 for a coffee and shower before boarding the flight to Bali this time on a 787-10 my favorite SQ Aircraft. Departed a little late for this 2hour 20 minutes flight, crew very nice as was the food, bags delivered to the belt quickly all in all a great trip. I believe SQ are still up with the best. I guess the only thing missing is that amenity kit."
2023-04-19,8,8,"""very good crew""","✅ Trip Verified | MXP-SIN and return. First time for me with SIA, in a very long flight in Premium. Very positive the attitude of the whole cabin crew: very kind, professional and available to satisfy passenger requests. Food and drink were the same than economy, besides they supplied sleeping masks and socks for the night flight only after we requested them. Poor IFE, and annoying loud music during the whole descent and until arrival at the finger. All in all very good crew, but I suspect that in these last years they lost something regarding the quality they were famous for."
2023-04-19,4,4,"""The food was not good""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight started on March 18 KUL-FRA and we were asked to check in our Baby stroller at the gate and we will get it in Germany. The food was not same as before and the quality is pretty bad. Upon arrival we were informed that our stroller did not make the flight and it was delay for 3 days. Worse part when the stroller was return it was damaged. On our return flight April 15 FRA - KUL We found out that our original seats which was bassinet seats were changed and we had to go to the airport early to make sure that my baby has a bassinet. This was very frustrating for us with a 1yr old baby. We were also ask to check in at the gate another bag that contains my baby items as it was too big to go into the overhead cabin as per the crew. Upon check in we were move to the back side on the aircraft not the seats we booked. The food was not good as well and too far in between for a 12hr flight, the crew was helpful but not regularly offering drinks /snacks not sure if that is the new standard. Meals was served less than 1hr before landing and the crew was rushing the meals. Upon arrival at Singapore a delay on our bags, so we had to wait and check at the airport longer just to get some clarification. They didn't know where our bags are and just informed us that it will be delivered home. Once my baggage was delivered, my luggage was damaged and unusable wheels caved in and the fragile sticker gone."
2023-04-17,1,1,"""We were disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flights were all delayed and the transfers at Changi Airport were not smooth. Going flight on 14 April 2023 SQ929 SUB-SIN, the departure from Surabaya was delayed. When arrived in Changi Airport, we could not get on our flight to Haneda, and our flights were changed to Narita. The airport change caused longer travel time (from Haneda to home is less than 1 hour but from Narita is more than 2 hours) and cost (from Haneda is about 500 yen but from Narita is about 4500 yen). Return flight on 16 April 2023, SQ631 HND-SIN flight arrival to Changi Airport was delayed. While we could make it to connection flight to Surabaya, our luggage could not. We were disappointed with Singapore Airlines."
2023-04-13,7,7,"""comfy seat, good service""","✅ Trip Verified | Star Alliance lounge in Paris rather mediocre, crowded, upper level closed for no apparent reason. Flight uneventful, with comfy seat, good service, stable Wi-Fi and decent entertainment. Food quality and presentation rather poor. Transit in SG uneventful with crowded lounge with average food offerings. The food on the short sector to BKK was so much better than the flight from Paris to Singapore."
2023-04-09,6,6,"""did not offer toiletries pack""","✅ Trip Verified | We took SQ285 SIN/AKL on 6/3/23 and SQ282 AKL/SIN on 19/3/23 The service has dropped in comparison to our past experience on SIA. The world class hospitality as the latest TV advertisement claims is sadly missing. The warmth, friendliness, cheerfulness, the unique character and personality of Singapore Airlines was not there. There were no disposable wet wipes provided when we boarded the plane. The first meal took fairly long before it was served. Between meals, crew would be walking up and down the aisle with water, drinks and snacks but I did not see this. On our return flight on SQ282, the crew did offer a few rounds of orange juice and water but no snacks. They did not offer toiletries pack. Whether I would recommend this airline, depends on the price point at the time of booking in comparison to other airlines out there. The whole experience felt like a very regular, no fuss airline experience."
2023-04-04,10,10,"""very friendly and attentive""","✅ Trip Verified | The crew members were very friendly and attentive. Especially when my friend felt uncomfortable and vomited, they provided considerate care, which I am very appreciated."
2023-04-01,5,5,"""Impeccable service""","Not Verified | Impeccable service, just be aware of the timing of connections, they sell tickets with only one hour stopover. Do not accept to buy connecting flights with less than 2 hour time stopover."
2023-03-30,2,2,"""no manned counters available for economy class""","Not Verified | There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight."
2023-03-27,10,10,"""usual pleasant experience at Changi""","✅ Trip Verified | The usual pleasant experience at Changi airport with a decent lounge and swift security clearance. The flight was uneventful, quiet with good food, seat, entertainment and service. Even the Wi-Fi was reasonably fast and stable. Overall highly recommended."
2023-03-27,1,1,"""I do not appreciate being treated like a fool""","✅ Trip Verified | The sector was the first leg of a Bangkok to Paris business class ticket. I received a call from SQ a day prior to departure requesting a voluntary downgrade due to last minute aircraft change and not having enough business class seats. I was told that I would receive S$ 200 plus a same sector upgrade voucher. I agreed and I was told that I would receive an email shortly with the details; which was never sent. Upon check-in, I was told that it was an error, that I would receive either the cash or the voucher. I opted for the cash, since I had no use for the sector upgrade. At the gate, I received a letter that there would be a fare difference compensation, which, in my case exceeded the S$ 200. After having three compensation versions, I approached the purser of the flight who told me that the payment would be $200 and another $ 200. (Version number 4). She also told me that she would mention my case in n her flight report and asked for my email address. She told me that I would be contacted shortly, which never happened. I also wrote in to SQ with no response received. I am not trying to get something out of this, but I do not appreciate being treated like a fool. The flight itself was rather mediocre with SQs new concept of tiny portions in a cardboard box, which does not work for me. The few spoons of lukewarm tasteless Laksa in a cardboard box was probably one of the worst economy food ever. The seat/aircraft was good and comfortable."
2023-03-19,10,10,"""I want to congratulate the crew""","Not Verified | I want to congratulate the crew for all the attention and service given to us ( My wife and myself). I even asked for their names. They are Wah Lian, Jeffrey, Vivian, Ying, Gloria and Sofia. Please convey our best wishes to them. I have always flown Singapore Airlines and always will in the near future"
2023-03-07,10,10,"""Good food and great cabin crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Good food and great cabin crew. We asked to see the suites, and they let us, after people have left the airplane. Our platypus got some champagne!"
2023-03-07,5,5,"""there was no more beer onboard""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore on Singapore Airlines SQ325, 23 February 2023. 1st drink service served on trays with cups of water or juice & pack of mixed nuts instead of the drink trolley. 1hr+ into a 12hr flight, dinner was served. When it was my turn, I asked for a beer with my dinner but was told there was no more beer onboard explained staff. This flight felt a lot like Scoot."
2023-03-05,9,9,"""up to their usual high standards""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ 212 on B777-300 SYD/SIN ; A350-9 SIN/BKK/SIN & SQ 231 on A380 SIN/SYD. First international flight since covid. Two things stand out - as expected, Singapore Airlines were up to their usual high standards with requests, check-in, seating and efficient, friendly cabin service. Despite aircraft being full, a polite request for preferred seating afforded us seats near bulkheads or in exit rows - making the longer sectors far more pleasant with the extra legroom. Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was ""oversize"" and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !. Excellent communication and service. It was apparent the item had missed the connecting flight in Singapore - as evidenced by the ""rush"" stickers etc all over the article.. Singapore Airlines - a cut above the others."
2023-02-27,9,9,"""very positive other than food""","✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Singapore flight of 12 hours 55 minutes literally flew by, helped by a decent seat but mainly because of stewardess Shirin. It was an absolute delight being served by her, she was friendly, helpful but at all times very professional. The only disappointing issue on the flight was the food which was of a poor quality and tasteless. The onward flight from Singapore was good but again the food on this flight was dreadful. My overall thoughts on this journey were very positive other than food and on that basis I have already booked again for later in the year."
2023-02-25,7,7,"""Excellent plane. Great service""","Not Verified | London to Singapore, A350 Excellent plane. Great service. Fantastic IFE, terrible food and small portions. I managed to sleep for half of the flight. Singapore to Manila on Boeing 787 an excellent plane. Great service on this short overnight flight. Fantastic IFE. Food was better than previous flight, but still not great. Singapore Airlines meals aren't as good as they used to be."
2023-02-24,2,2,"""boxes fixed under the seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Terrible seats. We had no space for our legs due to boxes fixed under the seats in front of us. My girlfriend had these boxes fixed in front of her, leaving her only 60% of space for her feet. Myself had only 70% of normal feet space for economy class."
2023-02-22,10,10,"""The staff was very pleasant""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been very satisfied with them. At first I was disappointed because originally the A380-800 was supposed to be used, which is my favorite. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The food was excellent and beautifully served on high-quality porcelain. Entertainment is very good and extensive. I rate free Internet access with limited speed very positively. The flight was smooth and we landed on time."
2023-02-16,2,2,"""their refund is not fair""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked an economy ticket from Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. I upgraded my seat because of health issues. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade of my flight from Amsterdam to Brisbane. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Singapore Airlines decided to overbook the flight. When I arrived in Singapore I found out that my seat was given to someone else. I could not fly business class to Brisbane. They gave me me an economy seat. The service was very slow and unprofessional. I asked about the refund. Only 10 days later after sending several emails to Singapore airlines, requesting more information regarding the refund, they told me I would receive a refund of only 1.545 euros. When I upgraded my seat from Amsterdam to Brisbane I was charged 3.958 euros for the upgrade. My husband also upgraded his seat from Amsterdam to Singapore on the same flight and was charged 1.217 euros. Based on these fees, I expected a refund of 2.741 euros (3.958 - 1.217). I believe that customers who are affected by this issue deserve a quick and a fair and reasonable refund. The offer I received does not meet this standard. On top of this: When I arrived in Brisbane, my luggage had not arrived. They told me the luggage would arrive in the next plain , the next morning at 7.00 O’clock. They would make sure my luggage would arrive at my accommodation the same afternoon. When I phoned to get more information I could not reach any one. I send several emails and received no reply. After numerous phone calls I finally spoke to someone. He told me that my luggage would not be delivered that same afternoon (although it had actually arrived that morning at 7:00 in the morning. It took a lot of other phone calls before they had my luggage delivered that evening."
2023-02-13,7,7,"""very attentive and informative""","Not Verified | We queued for checkin for 30 minutes, staff were very good. A chaotic and slow boarding process at the gate but when we entered the jet bridge it was very calm and welcoming with staff being very attentive and informative. We had a problem with our star alliance flight the night before as it was cancelled so we were reallocated this flight. Singapore Airlines gave us the front economy seat which had more leg room than any other flight. It was on time and meals were served soon after take off meals were good as well as the rest of the flight"
2023-02-02,10,10,"""cabin crew was amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Imagine a 14 hour trip being near perfect. Boarding, crew, food, seat, Wi-Fi, drinks, all of it. This cabin crew was amazing and managed to be sincere while also being efficient. They seemed to truly want to deliver the best and they did. 14 hours literally flew by in the lie flat comfy seat. The crew was proactive and seemed available whenever I needed something."
2023-02-01,9,9,"""A decent experience""","✅ Trip Verified | A decent experience. Check in was fast and easy, lounge was comfortable with good food offerings. Boarding was slightly chaotic but not awful. The aircraft is wonderful with comfortable seating and leg room. IFE was good. Meal decent for a two hour flight. Had to ask for an amenity kit. Flight was basically on time. Not stellar but better than most. Wifi wasn’t working."
2023-01-24,1,1,"""we were 4 minutes late""",✅ Trip Verified | The ground crew were unreasonable and very rude. We were denied boarding as according to them we were 4 minutes late. The ground crew did a lousy job of offloading our luggage. We had to wait almost half a day in the baggage carousel before filling a missing bag report.
2023-01-20,9,9,"""cabin crew were amazingly good""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew LHR - SIN and SIN- LHR in December. Both flights were the morning A380 flights in Premium Economy. So we’ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about £600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra £300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It’s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around £600-£700 for long haul return. £600 economy vs £1200 Premium, that a no brainer. If you have the cash then do it. But £600 economy and £1600 Premium, then I’d personally say that’s too much for what you get"
2023-01-20,10,10,"""Hospitality was five-star""","Not Verified | Singapore Airlines is by far the best airline I have flown it. The cabin is a spacious 3-3-3 layout in it's Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However, the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches, cup ramen, chips, cookies, etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was five-star. From the welcome at the door, the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultra-long haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard, it is amazing to see them help you with a smile, always. In seat entertainment had a lot of options and can easily entertain any person, young or old, on a 17 hour flight. In all, the experience was great and I would recommend SQ to everyone."
2023-01-19,10,10,""" Singapore Airline is the best airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Have heard great things about Singapore Airlines, so decided to give it a try. Booked a long haul flight. Even though it's almost 17 hour flight, but didn't feel like one, when my journey ended I was as fresh as when I boarded the flight. Silverkris lounge at Changi Airport was good. They have sleeping pods as well as a bathroom, where you can take a shower, in case you feel like one. Food was amazing. They have the facility called - ""Book a Cook"", which I'd used for getting my Steak. (Attached the pic), it was so delicious and perfect as if I'm dining in a restaurant. Crew were polite and very helpful. Only drawback that I find is - at New York (JFK Airport), they don't have a nice lounge. Lounges, they have partnered with were so small and didn't have a nice quick bite / snacks or drinks. Wish they could do something about it. All in all, must admit, Singapore Airline is the best airline."
2023-01-19,1,1,"""miss pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own company's baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future."
2023-01-18,5,5,"""a very average experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Was this a memorable flight? Not really. I like the entertainment selection. The seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on SQ177. Actually not much different to the 350-900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer. The food. Oh my. Dreadful. Sounded great, lemongrass chicken. It was very fatty and unpleasant. The bok choy was almost raw. I would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice I was given. All in all it was a very average experience. I miss the Singapore Airlines pre Covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially. I booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to HCMC via Singapore than just to Singapore. However, I wish I booked through Vietnam Airlines and saved money and connection hassles."
2023-01-16,7,7,"""crew really are the highlight""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul."
2023-01-11,10,10,"""best airline I have ever been on""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the best airline I have ever been on. The lounge before flight was amazing, the service was quick and the people were kind. On my flight from Singapore to New York , one stewardess specifically, Belle, made my 19 hour long trip with my brother an absolute delight. She was attentive, kind, and went above and beyond. When I asked if I could skip the appetizer meal (since it was a food I generally do not like) she asked if I would like fruit instead to replace it. She also would always quickly and kindly help me make my seat into a bed! (The seat form was a 8/10 for comfort but the bed was SOOO nice I slept for most the flight). This was the first time I had ever traveled Business class and I felt like royalty. Even the bathroom was nice with amenities like a hairbrush. My one feedback for improvement would be to automatically give things that are included (I had to ask for slippers and mask on my flight from Singapore to NY but it was laid out from NY there) but even that was still good. While the wifi isn't strong enough for videos, it was good for surfing the internet which is what I used it for, and I charged my phone so I left with full battery."
2023-01-07,9,9,"""the experience was delightful""","Not Verified | A thoroughly pleasant experience, bearing in mind this flight was during the height of Covid-19 and New Zealand had just reopened its borders. Check-in was a bit truncated, given the amount of documentation required and the person managing our check-in was receiving training. Once on board the experience was delightful, food and beverage service was lovely, including signature Singapore Slings. The A350 was very clean, and I particularly like the additional screen on the handset. Legroom was adequate, though better than many others; that said, the flight only had 75 passengers, so my wife and I had a row to ourselves."
2023-01-05,1,1,"""A good seat, tasteless food""","Not Verified | Disappointing flight from Singapore to Auckland. A good seat, tasteless food and the worst Illy coffee i have had. What concerned me the most is the cost we paid for these flights, this one one of four flights we took on Singapore airlines over the last three weeks. The Auckland to Singapore flights seemed understaffed, whereas the Singapore to Bangkok flights seemed a lot more organised and a better food selection."
2022-12-28,5,5,"""It was a 5/10 flight""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but that’s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5/10 flight. Nothing special."
2022-12-27,4,4,"""My inflight food was very bad""","✅ Trip Verified | They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this."
2022-12-27,7,7,"""seats although adequate were so much smaller""","✅ Trip Verified | Full flight. Check in was busy, business class full. The lounge in Melbourne was okay, bit old and dated but the food was good. Boarding protocol was strictly adhered to. We were warmly welcomed. This medium haul aircraft was far different to the A380 in business. The seats although adequate were so much smaller. I was surprised to see not only a blanket and pillow but slippers, face mask, socks and amenity kit on my seat. The storage bin overhead is very high up and 158cm me needed help to stow my bag. Not much storage at the seat, just under the footstool and a tiny cubby hole once the headphones and water are removed. The staff were very friendly but reactive rather than pro active. They didn’t check the cabin during the flight but would respond to pushing the button for an attendant. The food was okay. Nothing special, steak was tough but the dessert was lovely (cheesecake). Entertainment was pretty good, quite a lot of choice, and the flight map was excellent. The refreshment before landing was not nice, chorizo and pasta. Quantity not quality. We arrived slightly sooner than scheduled. Altogether it was good for a day flight but not sure it will be comfortable enough for an overnight flight."
2022-12-18,7,7,"""a good flight was spoiled by an awful start""","✅ Trip Verified | Check in at Brisbane was the worst we have ever experienced. There is only one business class counter, which resulted in a 30 +minute queue. On taking this up with the duty manager I was told this is to push passengers to use the check in machine and deal with their own luggage. Fine for passengers familiar with the system, but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era, and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class. Having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that Brisbane Airport has abolished fast track security. Obviously an airport decision but it begs the question, as a major user of Brisbane, have Singapore Airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility. The lounge had a good selection of food Once the flight boarded it was back to the excellent service we expect. So unfortunate that a good flight was spoiled by an awful start - the business class experience should begin on first arrival at the airport."
2022-12-17,1,1,"""Delayed baggage when I arrived""",Not Verified | What a shame. Delayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day. I arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone. I don't know where is my luggage and I am left waiting for it at home. Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book. Was my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last.
2022-12-08,5,5,"""seriously reconsider premium economy""","✅ Trip Verified | Seat 32A could not be reclined so it defeated the purpose of paying extra for premium economy for a comfortable seat. Seat 32C took so much effort to force it to recline. The buttons did not seem to do anything. I had to push to force it to recline. My Singapore Sling was overly sweet and it felt it was made deliberately to avoid asking for a second one. No warm towels and a small packet of nuts given quite a while after the drinks service was completed. There was a great movies/tv selection. The noise cancelling headphones were the large ear encompassing ones. Two small bottles of water were sitting in between the seats. When we boarded at the appropriate announcement time based on sections, our cabin was full so most people had boarded earlier. The economy class cabin had many empty seats. On reflection, had I had knowledge of seat bookings, I would have opted for economy. Premium class was not delivered. I asked for an amenity bag and the flight attendant looked at me puzzled, as though one such a thing did not exist. Reluctantly an economy class bag with just socks and toothbrush was procured. Food was same as economy although I pre-ordered mine. No dessert on the tray but a small tub of Hagen Daez ice cream. It seems they were anxious to get meal service done as quickly as possible. The flight attendants were friendly on boarding but we hardly saw them after the meal service. No mid-flight snacks. Plane left and arrived on time. Overall I will seriously reconsider premium economy."
2022-12-01,9,9,"""Would happily fly with them again""","Not Verified | (Two separate return journeys, different equipment). Pretty well can't be faulted. E.g. the airline staff went the extra mile in several respects, including luggage which didn't make a tight connection, but which I still got in 24 hours. The A350s are somewhat more comfortable in feel than even the A380s, the IFE on both aircraft is good, though the A350s have a live BBC news feed I can recommend. Would happily fly with them again."
2022-11-28,5,5,"""offer me the Business Class entrée""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ171 DAD-SIN. Terrible flight. Boarding started late and was chaos, with no real explanation about the delay. Upon boarding could not use the overhead above my seat, and was not allowed to have any personal items. There was a Headphone shortage. Took off, and inflight service started rather late. Cabin attendants speaking extremely fast, and I was unable to comprehend what they were saying. Multiple times, Had to ask them to slow down. They ran out of food. Offered Entrée was disgusting, and I refused. They came back, and tried to offer me the Business Class entrée, but there was only 1 choice. I passed, but they hounded me with endless questions. Landed, and couldn’t get access to my luggage. Singapore Airlines is only good on Ultra Long Haul flights. With Asian connections not anymore, since they got rid of the A330."
2022-11-24,10,10,"""hard-working cabin crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was prompt and the flight landed early. Very hard-working cabin crew. They tried their best to fulfil requests. They were less proactive with coming around with drinks during the flight compared to my previous flights, but responded to individual requests made to them directly. The aircraft was very clean but cupholder on my seat was broken. Overall I feel comfortable flying with this airline and would choose to do so again, knowing I will get a certain standard of service."
2022-11-24,10,10,"""lived up to high expectations""","✅ Trip Verified | My first flight post-pandemic and Singapore Airlines lived up to high expectations. The cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water, juice and sometimes beer. I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service. Everything went smoothly, from boarding to disembarking. Prior to the flight I had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient."
2022-11-24,9,9,"""provides excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines ranged from excellent to good. Syd-Sin-Cph (Oct 6, 2022) was excellent. Of course in Economy we were packed like sardines, but the tin was large enough (and neighbours small enough) that we weren't particularly uncomfortable. This is the third time we've flown post-Covid. The first time on Thai it seemed that Covid was the excuse to give no service at all but Singapore Airlines both at Xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service. Food was very good and alcohol plentiful. The entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul. Flight attendants were very attentive. We stopped over in Singapore on our way home. Unfortunately Sin-Syd leaves shortly after midnight. The flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left. This is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether we'd be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg. Of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint."
2022-11-24,10,10,"""maybe the best experience""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ23 in Premium Economy Solo Seat. 1730 Arrived at The counter. Instantly was approached, and greeted by a extremely professional gentleman, Asking which flight I was on. When I told him SQ23, he asked “could you please wait?”. Well I went to get water, came back, and instantly he reengaged me, stating the counter was ready for me, and took me straight to the head of the line. Check in fast, with agent verifying information. Boarding was quick. Upon boarding a Red Uniformed Cabin Attendant welcomed me aboard, and directed me to my seat. As I passed others they acknowledged me and welcomed me aboard. One even said “Happy Thanksgiving”. Aircraft seemed extremely cold, and rather uncomfortable. We seemed to be late pushing back, and The Red Uniformed staff was going around talking to passengers. She approached me, and began to engage in conversation. She thanked me for flying SQ for 14 years. Finally we Took off. I had to use the provided blanket. Champagne is back on the menu. When they arrived with Dinner, they ran out of food, so the Steward said he had to go to Business to get entrees. He came back and said what he had. I ordered the Beef. He kept checking in, with estimated time of completion. Constant Champagne rounds followed through the flight. After dinner I slept. Standalone seat extremely comfortable, and excellent value. Second meal came out. I had the Stir Fry Shrimp which was Delicious. Constant Champagne refills continued. On approach to Changi, I switched to Coffee, which also continued with multiple rounds. Arriving in SIN on Thanksgiving morning, crew wished us well as we debarked. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008. This flight maybe the best experience I have ever had with them!!!"
2022-11-23,5,5,"""seats were super uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | I'm a vegetarian, the food was tasty but I have some thoughts: a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals? I had to ask for a drink because the service walked by multiple times ignoring me. I flew with them 4 times, two flights of 14.5 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights, I can say that the service was at a high level. The seats were super uncomfortable. The number of drinks served for 14.5 hours is really poor. The last drink I asked for was water, and the staff brought me a tap water."
2022-11-16,8,8,"""the cabin crew were excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Late evening check in was surprisingly busy, but with all counters open there was not much delay. Similarly the lounge was busy. There was a decent selection of food, but the wine on offer was disappointing. Boarding was prompt with a friendly welcome, and champagne and fruit juice on offer before take off. Drinks were served immediately after take off, and it seemed that most passengers opted for sleep rather than food. The seats are very comfortable for sitting and relaxing, but in the lie flat position the recess for the feet is restricting. There were four breakfast type food options available, to be served immediately or before landing, which made a lot of sense, but the Continental breakfast was very basic and disappointing. Brisbane airport was very quiet early morning, and immigration and luggage delivery very quick. Overall it was a good flight, and the cabin crew were excellent, as expected on Singapore Airlines."
2022-11-15,1,1,"""pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change""","✅ Trip Verified | I wanted to change my flight ticket on 20th of April and was rushed to send a confirmation for a flight change before 21st April which involved a payment of 300 SGD which I agreed to. Upon calling back a few days later after checking that my flight has not been booked over the website, the agent over the phone tried to salvage the situation by insisting that my original flight change booking flight was cancelled and instead, I now would have to pay SGD 1700 to rebook the flight change. There was no such cancellation of flights as the flight number of the ""cancelled"" flight was the exact same flight as the one that he proposed. I tried calling on multiple occasions and even though Singapore Airlines admitted their fault for messing up my booking, they would not change my flight at the original price that was agreed upon. As a result, I had to miss my other travel plans to London. My main issues are these: 1) After rushing me to confirm the flight changes before 21st April, which I did on 20th April, why was the flight not booked at the original agreed price of SGD 300. Is it a lack of competence that your staff can't operate a computer?"
2022-11-14,6,6,"""chicken curry for breakfast?""",✅ Trip Verified | I ordered Muslim Meals and received Chicken curry for breakfast lunch and dinner. Seriously chicken curry for breakfast? About 20 years ago I wrote to Singapore Airlines about the same issue. Take note Muslim diets are much broader than chicken curry.
2022-11-08,10,10,"""I have no words for the hospitality""",✅ Trip Verified | I have no words for the hospitality the Singapore Airlines staff on the flight has shown me I have taken more then 20 flights this year but undoubtedly this airline is the best. I will surely and only try to fly Singapore. I am just amazed by the love and care they showed to my 7 year old from Mumbai to Sydney and coming back to India from Sydney. Thank you so much.
2022-11-08,1,1,"""denial that it even took place""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. It's not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place."
2022-11-05,2,2,"""Last time SA for us""","✅ Trip Verified | Boarding while there is a power problem. So plane were no lights. Startup again power then no aircon! Delayed already, then excuse and safety demo. Then again captain still problems and sitting already one hour no aircon and just have to wait when or if they fixed it Serving warm water and while no aircon and still waiting to leave 22.00 hour. Last time SA for us."
2022-11-02,9,9,"""Overall a very good flight""","Not Verified | Check in was quick and efficient as expected with Singapore Airlines. Lounge access was the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse, which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to SQ passengers. Lounge service was excellent, with a good selection of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing. Overall a very good flight"
2022-10-31,3,3,"""don't provide salt and pepper""","✅ Trip Verified | No pillows in economy cabin for a 13hr flight, I was offered an extra blanket to use as a makeshift pillow, hardly comfortable. Meal portions were small, no salad or small starter was offered, no towelette and they don't provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal. WiFi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations ! All in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying Singapore Airlines again."
2022-10-26,7,7,"""I was not offered a drink""","✅ Trip Verified | No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first. From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time."
2022-10-25,1,1,"""cancelling our paid seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Ruined a trip of a lifetime for myself, wife and family. From cancelling our paid seats, that were booked early, we were then separated on the flight. Some of our baggage was left behind, and a absolutely nightmare trying to sort. Staff on plane and at airports not interested and give the feeling that they did not want to be there."
2022-10-20,10,10,"""back with their reputation intact""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney - Amsterdam - Frankfurt -Singapore (stopover) - Sydney. All flights were up to the 'old' SIA standards of service. Check-ins and transfers were easy and the lounges were clean and well-stocked. Meals ordered online and were tasty and well presented with plentiful beer, wines and spirits offered with them and during the flight - possible a little too enthusiastically. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and made the flights very pleasant indeed. You do need to ask for amenity kits and slippers if you want them and the absence of an offer of hot towels was initially disappointing but a plentiful supply was discovered in the wash rooms for self-serve. The lie-flat beds were made up by the crew if you showed any hesitation in figuring out how they worked and were comfortable once you became used to the idea of sleeping on a bed where the lower half was offset to the upper half. Cabin WiFi worked OK and the IFE seemed to have a reasonable selection, although eating and sleeping were my preferred options on the overnight flights. All in all, SIA seems to be back with their reputation intact."
2022-10-12,10,10,"""Still my favorite airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class !, spacious seats with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work."
2022-10-05,3,3,"""food was terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Brisbane via Singapore. The food was terrible, no fresh fruit or salad items. We tried to change our return flight due to family circumstances and were told $10,000 to do this. That was way more than the advertised price of a return ticket. Seats felt cramped and uncomfortable."
2022-09-26,1,1,"""Very disappointed""",Not Verified | I flew with Singapore Airlines from London on a 11.30am local time arriving in Singapore 7.30am local time next day. For some unknown reason this airline serves breakfast at 1.45am Singapore time. I and other passengers were woken up so we could have a breakfast. Once breakfast was finished we still had 5 more hours of flying time. How stupid is this. Dreading my flight home. I have travelled with this airline in the past but it now is on a par with a low cost airline. Very disappointed.
2022-09-25,10,10,"""this is what a good flight should be""","✅ Trip Verified | The check-in process at JFK T4 was seamless. We got access to the Wingtips Lounge, which was fine but there was nothing to be excited about. Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers (our A380 flight that night was almost full). On board, the seat looks nice and comfortable, though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive, something you would expect from SQ anyway. The food was excellent (I booked my main course from the Book-the-Cook menu). The flight arrived in Frankfurt a bit late, but not a problem at all. Overall, this is what a good flight should be."
2022-09-19,4,4,"""JFK check in a disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK check in a disaster, with no control, and only 2 agents open. For an extremely protracted amount of time, I stood in line, and finally got checked in, just before the Station Manager mustered everyone, for the evening brief, pausing check in. Boarding commenced 15 minutes late. No boarding by rows, just a mass exodus. Upon boarding the Cabin Attendant at the door, was the sole person to welcome me onboard. IFE finally got upgraded, and the A380s fixed shellback seat was extremely comfortable. Upon taking off I dozed off, and was waken up by Cabin Crew to close my window shade. No initial drink offered to me. I requested Chicken for dinner, and the Gentleman said he had to come back. 15 minutes later, I hit the call button, and when the young lady I arrived, I explained to her I did not receive dinner. Finally the Gentleman returned, apologized, and ensured dinner would be out shortly, which it was. Followed by a second round of drinks. Woke up to a refreshment, of extremely small Sandwich of sorts, and a quick round of drinks. Arrived at FRA, and off to my connection. With all my hours, flights, and years flying with Singapore Airlines I will try to brush this off, and hope a repeat of this experience will not happen again."
2022-09-11,4,4,"""decline in service and product""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Sydney. The decline in service and product continues from Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy includes plastic glasses, only two wine choices (Red or White) only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airline’s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window. Unless you can book for only 10-15 % more than economy I wouldn’t bother Entertainment is good in its range but the system is unstable. Wifi wouldn’t connect"
2022-09-10,6,6,"""A pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew on Singapore Airlines last year and one thing I will say is that the friendliness of the crew is outstanding. However the seat space felt slightly cramped and the seats weren’t very comfy. I feel like the lower back support isn’t very good and this makes you sit in a position that is uncomfortable. I say this both for the A350 & A380. I am comparing this to my last journey with Singapore on an older 777-300ER, which in my opinion feels more spacious and the seats feel i lot less cramped. Also the lower back support is better. The meals, are okay by all means but when i compare this to Emirates or Qatar, they are very basic in the sense that all you get is a main dish, bread, crackers, cheese and a small desert of some kind. Nothing to shout about considering this is a top airline. The crew, outstanding on all flights I've been on, friendly and you can take your water bottle and keep filling it up. If you want a drink at any point you can go up and ask. Transit, probably one of the easiest airports to transit through. A pleasant experience, and if you have in excess of 4 hours you can occupy yourself with plenty. Overall i think i will fly again with Singapore Airlines but might try a different airline on my next journey to the UK."
2022-09-08,10,10,"""can’t say enough for their warm hospitality""","Not Verified | The staff were most helpful and delightful, especially Joanne, Lilin, Thiagesan and Edward. I can’t say enough for their warm hospitality, and being very friendly and capable in their jobs."
2022-09-08,2,2,"""stressful end to the trip""","✅ Trip Verified | They cancelled our return flight's first leg and said they could reschedule it for 8 weeks later. This was not going to work as we had lives to return home to. We hassled them for days and eventually, they put us on the first leg a day before. We had to leave our accommodation in Rome early, pay for accommodation in Munich and taxis to and from the airport. They suggested we could get compensation for this but since applying for that we have heard nothing. A very stressful end to the trip and disappointing experience."
2022-09-06,2,2,"""extremely dated and old aircrafts""","Not Verified | Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice."
2022-09-05,1,1,"""attempting to locate my luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew Singapore Airlines Brisbane to Cape Town, only to have them lose my luggage. Despite contacting the Cape Town, Brisbane and Singapore office I have had no contact from anyone, apart from a generic email, dated 6 days ago saying they are attempting to locate my luggage. What should have been a happy experience has been completely ruined not only losing my luggage, but all the gifts I had bought my family who I haven’t seen in four years."
2022-09-05,10,10,"""would always choose to fly with Singapore""","✅ Trip Verified | Great to be flying with Singapore airlines again! Pre Covid my wife and I had always flown with Singapore airlines and were interested to see whether the high standard of care that we were used to still existed in the post Covid world. The answer is yes. The food was great and its delivery well timed. The entertainment options were excellent with a menu to meet a wide variety of tastes. We were seated in the rear compartment so were able to see the staff at work. The staff we saw were: CS Alvin, LSS Mei, LS Aslam, FSS Chia, FSS Ng, FSS Foo and FSS Chee. They did not stop working for the whole flight yet they were always caring and courteous, going to every length to meet the passengers’ needs. They are great ambassadors for their company. Wherever possible, we would always choose to fly with Singapore"
2022-09-04,5,5,"""I am not impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ033 from San Francisco to Singapore in what was sold a premium economy. Apart from slightly larger seat there is nothing to distinguish from regular economy. Very cramped in 2-4-2 seating. No champagne for take-off on 15-hour journey, no amenities, not even hand cream in the bathroom. In addition the entertainment system was bizarre — if you aren’t a fan of Tom Cruise or superheroes you are out of luck. Seriously, there was nothing to watch. Could not comment on the dinner as we chose to eat in the airport. Breakfast was okay for an economy class meal but coffee was not good. I paid a substantial premium for this and I am not impressed."
2022-09-04,2,2,"""My meal was very poor""","✅ Trip Verified | Queued for Business class check in - only 2 servers. Entertainment very limited, games needs your own device. My meal was very poor. Seats and staff ok. Photo is the 5pm refreshment."
2022-08-27,1,1,"""requested to provide a seat together""","✅ Trip Verified | Our first flight was delayed more than one hour, so we lost our connecting flight. The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey. Miscommunication between the crew members made us to walk between the terminals for 2 times. Didn't get any help from the crew, even though we requested to provide a seat together."
2022-08-25,1,1,"""all special meals has been handed out""","✅ Trip Verified | Order special meals from through their apps. In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out. I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm what's the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion."
2022-08-24,1,1,"""said it was Lufthansa’s fault""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked all my flights through the Singapore Airline website. My flight from Edinburgh to Germany (LH965) with Lufthansa booked by Singapore Air was delayed which meant I missed the next 2 connecting flights Frankfurt - Singapore (SQ2151) and Singapore - Sydney (SQ325). I understand things like this happen and with hopes of being put on the next available flight I tried to let it not bother me I arrived at the airport no one with Singapore Air was there to help so I spoke with Lufthansa who put me in a hotel for the night which was nice but didn’t have any aircon in 40 degreases heat. I was told that Singapore Air would be in contact during the night when their customer service team opened to put me on the next flight. I was up most of the night anxiously waiting for the message of my next flight in case I missed it I was on an online chat with someone who said “I will help now” but then would just end the chat. I decided to head to the airport as it was now around 9 am with no contact by anyone and I had a wedding to make on Friday the 5th. I arrived at the airport and no one cared and didn’t even want to give me the time of day. Singapore Air said it was Lufthansa’s fault and Lufthansa said it was Singapore Air’s fault the walk time to each desk was around 15-20 mins and I was back and forth with everyone sending me to random desks for 3 hours. I was told there were no flights for 3-4 days and there was nothing I can do and it was my responsibility to pay for the time I’d need to spend in Germany, I’m a solo female aged 25 and was even refused to receive my case so had no clothes to wear. I checked Skyscanner and there were flights leaving that day, at this point, I had enough and went to the business class desk and demanded that I be put on this next flight that I repeatedly lied to that had no space.I was finally helped by someone and was easily put on the flight. Obviously, the extra leg room seats were taken which was understandable so I need to receive a refund for this."
2022-08-21,10,10,"""an amazing experience""",Not Verified | Great flight! I arrived yesterday morning in Amsterdam after an almost 13 hours trip from Singapore with my wife and small son. Flying in the business class of Singapore airlines was an amazing experience. The seat is very convenient. In the night the crew prepares a bed for you which was fine. I ordered before the flight the lobster which was absolutely delicious. The service during the flight was great. The crew was very nice to my son and us. The breakfast was also ok. All in all this was one of the best flight experiences ever for me! Amazing flight and service!
2022-08-19,10,10,"""definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Trip Verified | When I checked-in online for this flight, there was a premium economy seat that can be selected even if I only bought an economy class ticket. I selected it and I was able to have the seat with no extra charge. I was pleased with the ground handling, service and quality of food. The Laksa was very delicious! The flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was top-notch! One thing that was not working is the Wi-Fi as I was only able to use it for a few minutes. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again."
2022-08-14,3,3,"""meal was very poor in quantity and quality""","✅ Trip Verified | My recent flight from London to Singapore was very disappointing. Granted that the departure and arrival times were very good, and my seat was comfortable. Gone are the warms towels prior to your meal, no menu cards and no water runs through the flight. Then there was the lunch service, the bread roll was more like a brick - when asking the flight attendant if I could have another one he replied that they were all like that. No entree /dessert on meal tray. Breakfast was served 5 hours prior to landing and my meal was very poor in quantity and quality."
2022-08-10,10,10,"""outstanding service at the airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Smooth check-in and outstanding service at the airport. The red-eye flight was delayed by 1,5 hour and at the gate SQ organised a buffet where one could get a hot meal, able to choose between vegetarian on with chicken. It was a very nice touch, was really impressed (especially comparing it to what you don't get from other airlines in similar circumstances). After boarding, very welcoming crew and for those still hungry there was the normal meal service with a round of drinks."
2022-08-10,9,9,"""Very comfortable plane""","✅ Trip Verified | Nice flights, first leg got Premium Economy seat (but still normal Eco-Service) being SQ Gold. Nice hot meal as per the new concept for short flight with SQ. Long layover in SIN, could visit the new Silverkris Lounge and then onwards on SQ's new 737max. Very comfortable plane, nice interacting crew and lovely dinner served, watching a good movie on their in flight entertainment!"
2022-08-10,8,8,"""crew was very friendly and interactive""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ is one of my favorite airlines, but unfortunately in-cabin experience is less. Still great inflight entertainment (among the best in the industry) but food service is being downgraded. The round of drinks before dinner/lunch on longer flights, the appetizer on the tray and the hot towel upon boarding are gone. Of course nothing really serious, but with what you pay extra to fly with SQ it is an issue. Check-in process in FRA was efficient (as always with SQ) and the transit in SIN was a little tedious, as Germany (origin of my journey) was Covid-listed again: therefore it was not permitted to ""walk freely around"" the airport in January 2022 and I had to wait for my connection in a ""reserved quarantine area"". On the shorter flight to JKT you get now a box with (very) hot food, which is a downgrade compared to what you got before but still is quite ok. On both flights crew was very friendly and interactive."
2022-08-06,4,4,"""lunch service took almost 3 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its „upgraded“ new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service."
2022-08-04,9,9,"""it was a pleasant flight""","✅ Trip Verified | The aircraft used for this short 2 hour flight is the regional business class configuration with 1-2-1 layout. For solo travellers, the window seat is the best option and is arranged in an alternating manner with seats next to the window and next to the aisle respectively. The problem with the seat next to the window is that the winglet of the seat partially obscures the window so you will have to lean forward to look out of the window. On this morning flight I ordered Nasi Lemak for breakfast and it was delicious. Cabin crew were attentive and even for such a short flight the leading stewardess addressed me by name. Overall it was a pleasant flight even though I only had 20 minutes to lie flat before preparation for landing in Singapore."
2022-08-04,10,10,"""recommend the B737-800 Max business class""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew on the new business class product of SQ on their narrow body B737-800 Max to Phuket last month. The new product featured a fully flat reclining seat in a 1-2-1 configuration. For a 90 minute flight, I had a dinner of beef steak which was booked through the Book the Cook service. As expected with steaks on airline menus, the steak was a bit too well done for my taste. As it was a short flight, it was time to descend after the dinner service. I didn’t get to try out the full recline of the seat but it was comfortable with generous pitch in lounge mode. I would definitely recommend the B737-800 Max business class product for regional routes on SQ especially on the longer regional flights of 4-5 hours where you can get a short nap in full bed mode."
2022-07-29,5,5,"""they lost my luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Greece recently and they lost my luggage. The suitcase was returned to me at the end of my holidays (3 weeks later) and caused me to have to change holidays plans, lots of frustration trying to reach someone form the company and incurred unexpected expenses as I landed with no personal belongings. I've sent two separate feedback forms and there has been no reply and when I managed to finally reach someone from their call centre service, they did not know how to help me and put me on hold for half an hour. This is ridiculous customer service for a company which is supposed to be among the best in the world."
2022-07-27,4,4,"""no more gift for kids""","✅ Trip Verified | Our family flew with Singapore Airlines since long time. We had experienced a wonderful service, especially for kids. We were so disappointed when travelling again this time in July 2022 from Paris to Vietnam via Singapore. Fares were very high but foods were very poor, no more gift for kids, no menu for kids, no snack during long flight. We understand that pandemic may caused difficulty for all airlines, but Singapore Airlines should not cut expenses."
2022-07-26,8,8,"""a cheerful and engaged crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Full flights, yet great service from a cheerful and engaged crew. The planes were spotless and comfortable, and the IFE selection was excellent - lots of new releases as well as plenty of art house movies. Sadly no pre-meal drinks run anymore though. And the food, whilst of good quality, seemed rather small and there wasn't that much on the tray; I also wished there were more Singaporean options available - because when there are, they are delicious. Toilets kept clean throughout the flight. Very good flights from a consistently good airline."
2022-07-23,8,8,Singapore Airlines customer review,"Not Verified | London to Bali via Singapore. Having not travelled overseas for sometime due to the pandemic, I eventually got back to flying in April/May 2022 and it was so nice as I had normally taken a flight on average 20+ times a year prior to the pandemic. Check in was quick and polite checking my PCR result for entry to Bali security was quick and the Singapore Airlines lounge at Heathrow was okay. Boarding was more or less on time the seat as normal on SQ comfortable for the 12 hours flight. The crew where all pretty nice although I sensed perhaps not the normal expected on SQ, the food service was just okay good enough but again not really SQ standard that said the flight was fine. Arrival in Singapore on time I headed to the lounge to wait my connecting flight which was packed with little seating although I managed a shower. SIN-DPS was on the newer 787-10 which I really enjoyed nice crew food okay. I returned DPS-SIN in economy class again on the 787-10 and I was impressed great aircraft nice crew and the economy food box just fine for a 2 hour flight, I obviously like SQ and will continue to use hopefully service will improve as things return to normal"
2022-07-23,1,1,"""food tray was near empty""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines no longer the same, my food tray was near empty. I had chicken noodles, that's about it with a bread. Food was no better from Melbourne to Singapore. The rice with chicken packed with rice and 4 pcs of chicken and a bread. Used to have fruits and cakes, what was called sandwich was a soggy curry puff serves right before landing. From Melbourne to Singapore many were not masked. The air stewardess talked to the unmasked passengers and throughout the flight the passenger was mask off."
2022-07-18,4,4,"""cannot find your seat again""","✅ Trip Verified | The boarding and take-off was delayed. The food on board was beef stew, a piece of cake and a cold, rigid bread. It was very difficult to see for the middle row. They were written at a place you cannot see from the aisle, you go to toilet when the light is off and then you cannot find your seat again. They served me drinks twice during an 8-hour flight, I know we can ask for it any time."
2022-07-18,6,6,"""airline has good inflight service""","✅ Trip Verified | This airline has good inflight service. However, when I went to check in the agent at San Francisco asked for my vaccine certificate. This is not required at my destination in Cambodia, nothing except rapid test on arrival. I explained this to check in agent. After a while the supervisor took over and checked the requirements on her personal computer. The problem was old requirement were never updated."
2022-07-13,9,9,"""perceptions can be very different""","✅ Trip Verified | I was very surprised to read some of the comments in the review below. I travelled last week from Singapore to Melbourne on an A350-900 in business class, and it was one of my better flights this year. The seat product for a 7.5 hour flight was very comfortable with good privacy (6/1 tall), and the food and beverages that I was served were all to a good standard. Service was to the usual impeccable SIA standard, and the IFE choices were excellent. I accept that everyone's perceptions can be very different, but maybe sometimes there are some other issues at play when a review is written."
2022-07-13,1,1,"""little to no choices for me""","✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was smooth. No welcome-drinks offered, after request I got one. A narrow business-class seat, where I felt squeezed in, a huge console on the left, which is too high to use as an arm-rest and a divider on the right with reading lights. Sleeping for me was impossible, because the seat/bed is too narrow. With the exception of slippers no amenities offered, I was re-assured that amenity-kits are available on request. Caesar’s Salad came without dressing and croutons were missing, too. The salad was a green salad-leaf, one in 2 parts cut cherry-tomato and two tiny bits of thinnest parmesan cheese. The 2 choices of white wine were disappointing: both Australian wines, 1 Chardonnay and 1 Riesling. My main course, pan seared salmon was dry and overcooked. The vanilla ice-cream was nice, though and the cheese platter was at least a choice of 3, but served with no grapes. No pralines offered. As for my second meal, Tom Yum Vermicelli with prawns. Again, the dish was small but I could get a vanilla-chocolate cake. The inflight program was functioning, but with little to no choices for me. Since no printed reading material was available I wanted to download some business magazines to my laptop, but was informed, that download is possible on smartphones and tablets only."
2022-07-13,1,1,"""service and amenity-cuts""","✅ Trip Verified | I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canapés I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own – another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ‘wine connoisseurs’ – but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years’ single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn’t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers, I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts it’s time to say goodbye."
2022-07-10,2,2,"""cancelled my flight for operational reasons""",✅ Trip Verified | My initial flight was booked from Singapore to Darwin in April 2022. They cancelled my flight to Darwin for operational reasons and rebooked me after three days. I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money. Incompetent customer service staff and SQ's attitude to their own cancellation was pathetic. The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care.
2022-07-07,10,10,"""cabin crew some of the best""","✅ Trip Verified | After 2 years of not being to fly with them, finally I made it! I was luckily to be chosen to upgrade from PE to J at a very attractive price last minute. It was money really well spent! It was wonderful to step into their premium cabin again, and experienced their excellent seat with many modern features. Their cabin crew are still amongst some of the best in the airline industry. I was greeted warmly and had excellent service from start to end. Having learnt that I was to go to Singapore to visit families and celebrate my birthday, they surprised me with a cake and some inflight goodies, that truly made my day! Personally, on this route, I did not see any decline in quality of meals and service. Except, maybe the lack of welcome drink, hot towels, which is excusable for covid reason. Meals are still served in separate courses, and with wine, which is constantly refilled. J class passengers, even upgraded ones like me, get 100 MB free WiFi, which was generous and very handy."
2022-07-07,9,9,"""Truly friendly staff""","✅ Trip Verified | From the moment we got to the check-in to the farewell wishes on disembarkation it felt like we had travelled back in time to the golden days of air travel – this is what it was all about. Truly friendly staff on the ground and in the air, a perfectly clean, spacious and tidy cabin all made for a flight that was most enjoyable from start to finish. I will definitely spend a few dollars more to fly Singapore Airlines in the future."
2022-07-06,6,6,"""it was a far cry from the past""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew to/from SFO in Business Class and it was not worth it. On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open. The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me. I will think long and hard before flying their Business Class again."
2022-07-02,2,2,"""the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated""","✅ Trip Verified | Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with 'sorting' the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead 'proof' was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, 'designed for a reason' (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is 'mandatory' was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage."
2022-06-25,9,9,"""Thanks to ground staff""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight to London from Belfast was delayed, and I only managed to reach counter at 1100. I was told that I am not able to board SQ317, which depart at 1125. However, I was told by the ground staff not to stress and was assured that they will try to work things out. Throughout the process, they were very friendly, professional and prompt to get me a flight SQ305 back to Singapore on the same day, which departs at 1255. In fact, they get me a aisle seat with leg space. Having stressed out the whole morning with the delayed earlier flight, I breathed a sigh of relief. Thanks to ground staff Preeti and Kaye."
2022-06-22,10,10,"""Singapore Airlines is still the best""","✅ Trip Verified | Thank you to the cabin crew flying 20 June. After 2.5 years of COVID ravages, Singapore Airlines still maintains outstanding service and food. Complimentary WiFi worked very well too. It is sad that Book the Cook is now only available from flights out of Singapore, but it is minor. Singapore Airlines is still the best."
2022-06-19,4,4,"""my reserved seat was not honored""","✅ Trip Verified | The second leg of my trip from Hanoi to San Francisco was on SQ032 on June 16th, and this is the flight I wish to review because my reserved seat was not honored. I was first given a seat which was totally unacceptable and I requested another aisle seat. The second seat was in the exit row directly next to the door (facing the crew jump seats). This new seat had no storage pockets since there was no seat in front, and had both monitor and tray table attached. The toilets were directly behind the crew seats giving me little if any privacy and almost no chance to sleep with the toilet traffic. It is true that this new seat had extra leg room. I was quite miserable in this seat due to the lack of privacy and I had to use the floor for my storage needs. Thank god for the snacks in the rear because the 2 meals served were pretty bad. The flight attendants were most helpful throughout the flight, but I will seriously consider my options when flying this route in the future."
2022-06-17,1,1,"""worst food in business class""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airline is an expensive budget airline. The service was very poor, the call center the worst. This flight I had the worst food in business class I had experienced. Service is slow always and wine options are like economy. Wi-if not working for the overall trip."
2022-06-14,7,7,"""I had excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | I thought I had excellent service from both the ground staff and the staff on the plane, they really did go out of their way to help me. The only downsides were I thought the mediocre food. having to wear a mask the entire time on an 18 hour flight and the fact my tickets say changes are complimentary but they want to charge me the full price of a ticket to change them."
2022-06-12,10,10,"""the standard remains remarkable,""","Not Verified | Our first family holiday (with 2 young children) since pandemic hit. Even with the changes due to COVID (no hot towel etc), the standard remains remarkable, especially the warmness of the cabin crews and extra care towards our 4 year old and 6 year old children. Drinks were replenished throughout the flight. Food and drinks were great with ""book the chef"" option. We had the signature Lobster dish and the meat was as tender as it can get, for an in flight meal. Departure and Arrival were on time as usual, and great effort by the cabin crew."
2022-06-11,1,1,"""flight was very disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | Prior to flying I had a nightmare trying to rearrange my flight when quarantine rules changed. Emails were not replied to and the UK telephone line required a pin to proceed. The change I required was not possible online. I purchased an aisle seat but I was not allocated one when they changed my booking. The flight was very disappointing. We took off about 12.30pm. After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought. I was quite disgruntled so attempted to get a refund on the seats I had purchased and voice my complaints. Yet again I have found it impossible to contact them."
2022-06-08,2,2,"""meals were one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines is no longer what it used to be. The call centre is a disgrace and fails miserably in its job. Check-in was chaotic. Inflight service has dropped to dismal levels. There is no welcome drink, no hot towels, no menus given. The meals were one of the worst I have ever had. The eggs were dry and rubbery. I have had far better meals in the economy class on Flydubai which is a budget airline."
2022-06-06,3,3,"""The food was only just enough""","✅ Trip Verified | Best aircraft in the fleet! I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. It’s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare. I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again."
2022-06-06,3,3,"""No wifi all flight""","✅ Trip Verified | First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat. The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense."
2022-06-01,10,10,"""definitely fly Singapore Airlines again""","✅ Trip Verified | SIN-EWR: Purchased a ticket, with one of the 1/6 Standalone Premium Economy Seats. Check in at Changi quick. Tried to purchase lounge access but was turned down. The gate was opened 50 minutes prior to boarding. Boarding was smooth, on what seemed to be a full flight. Seat, and adjacent stowage bin were perfect. Bin could comfortably hold my Rimowa Attaché, but not Business Class. Took off on time, flew a different route than the incoming flight. Flew asleep, Cabin Crew gently tapped me on the shoulder, to eat. Have had ANA, and EVA let me sleep, and tag my seat returning later. Meal was good, Mushrooms had lots of flavor. Two-three rounds of drinks included. Recommenced sleep, and woke up. Cabin crew appeared taking drink orders, and brought back snacks. Crew continuously smiled, were warm, and professional, throughout the flight. They continued to check in, and ensure I didn’t go empty. Second meal served, again with endless drink rounds. IFE was not up to par, with what I’ve previously experienced on Singapore Airlines. Landed at EWR on time, with my bag quickly appearing. Would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again."
2022-05-27,2,2,"""child was running up and down the aisle""","✅ Trip Verified | On 25th May I flew on SQ736 to Phuket. A young child was running up and down the aisle, during turbulence, approach and after landing, during taxi to gate. The parents absolutely didn’t care and the cabin crew didn’t either."
2022-05-23,7,7,"""Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was""","✅ Trip Verified | After having recently also travelled on Emirates I thought it might be interesting to compare business class on Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the quality of the cabin staff on all sectors was absolutely superb. Lets hope the quality of food and wine improves to how it once was."
2022-05-22,10,10,"""definitely continue to fly with them""","✅ Trip Verified | Business class in the longest commercial flight: Purchased tickets in February. SQ counter at EWR, opened what I thought was rather late, considering the Pandemic. Previously at JFK, FRA their counters opened earlier. Check in quick, efficient, and no stress. Virgin Atlantic Lounge was nice, however No alcohol at that early in the morning. We boarded on time. Upon sitting was greeted, with my Surname, and welcomed aboard. My Rimowa case would not fit in any of the spaces, and had to be stowed overhead. Airborne and I had my lunch order taken. I had the Braised Shortribs. Constant, Infinite drink rounds during the flight, with my Surname used. Over Turkey, they served the second meal, I had the Thai Chicken, lots of flavor but seemed rather small. I sent some texts to friends and proceeded to get a few hours sleep. Landed in Changi on time, with a speedy stop in Immigration, and my case was one of the first 10 out. I Have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008, will definitely continue to fly with them."
2022-05-14,1,1,"""Lots of room for improvement""",✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.
2022-05-13,2,2,"""Significant lower services and amenities""","✅ Trip Verified | There were no welcome-drinks offered, no paper-menu available, no newspapers or magazines offered, Slippers, eye-shades and socks on request. No tooth-brush- or shaving-kits in the washrooms, instead on request an amenity-kit containing a tooth-brush-set and a pair of socks. The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is – thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu – which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep. Chocolate (e.g. Ferrero Rocher before) on the snack-selection was replaced by cheap no-name cookies, which comes in a see-through plastic-container. The silver-kris-magazine available online only. The internet-connectivity was poor on this flight and did not work for more than 50% of the flight-time. Significant lower services and amenities for a significantly higher price."
2022-05-11,3,3,Singapore Airlines customer review,"✅ Trip Verified | We had a very unpleasant experience with Singapore Airlines. We have originally purchased our ticket to India from Auckland to Delhi and from Delhi to Auckland via Melbourne, leaving on the 9th of April and coming back on the 24th of April. We have received an email on 11th of February that our flight SQ4235 has been cancelled from Melbourne to Auckland. We have contacted the call centre and tried to rebook our flight. We choose the option of rebooking on 31st of May from Delhi to Auckland via Singapore so we have less transfers, flight number SQ403 and SQ4281 operated by Air New Zealand. The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online. We have tried to contact the call centre again but were unable to get hold on an operator 3 times (we totally understand the current circumstances). The Delhi Airport staff were lovely but were unable to upgrade our tickets. We don't mind Economy tickets as we normally would not upgrade our flights but, in this case, we had no other choice and were charged an extra amount for nothing."
2022-05-09,1,1,"""requests were pending for both flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Not recommended if you have food restriction. I requested many days via App and call before my flight SIN to LHR for gluten free and non-beef mean. However my requests were pending for both flights. The crew offered to serve me “Pasta with bread’ instead of gluten free meal. After feeding back to the airlines, there’s no response from them."
2022-05-08,1,1,"""A350 seats are thin and hard""","✅ Trip Verified | 5 star for flight attendants, always friendly and helpful. The A350 seats are thin and hard. Boarding process was very unorganised. Quality of my food was terrible. SilverKris lounge at Changi airport was chaotic, impossible to find a seat."
2022-05-04,2,2,"""asked for a refund/compensation""","✅ Trip Verified | My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds."
2022-05-04,6,6,"""service has been going down and prices going up""","✅ Trip Verified | Since COVID, Singapore Airlines service has been going down and prices going up, Phnom Penh to Paris which was approximately between 2800 and 3300$ is now around 5 to 6000$. They don't give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference."
2022-04-29,9,9,"""the experience was amazing""","Not Verified | After spending a little more on the flight than intended after flying on this return journey with Singapore was happy I did as the overall experience was second to none. The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff. Boarding the plane I immediately became aware of the ""Singapore girl"" exceptional customer service the airline is known for. The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved. I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other ""Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h"". When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said ""Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor"" Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again. Hopefully to try out their world class business class."
2022-04-29,1,1,"""refuses to refund my ticket""","✅ Trip Verified | The airline refuses to refund my ticket for May 2022. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen."
2022-04-28,6,6,"""I feel the standards are dropping""","✅ Trip Verified | I have flown SQ many times but I feel the standards are dropping. Contacting customer service was impossible. Call back takes about 3 working days. No issue with check in. Boarding as expected. The lounge in Singapore is very disappointing. Poor selection food, over crowded, reasonable service. On flight service is ok, efficient but not warm. Seats are good but dated. Food above average but no welcome drink or towel. I was ignored during the long 13h flight unless you ask for help. Don’t get me wrong, SQ is still above average but losing ground fast. They need to buck up. Start by improving customer service, don’t keep us waiting for hours for a reply on CHAT."
2022-04-23,1,1,"""waiting for check-in for over 2 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | The check-in process at JFK was the worst check-in experience I've experienced. I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didn't move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers. I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didn't even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor."
2022-04-19,1,1,"""Very average service""","✅ Trip Verified | My wife and I booked a ticket to Manila from London. A few weeks after we booked we received an e-mail that very clearly stated that we could upgrade to Business class and showed a price We jumped at it and booked. We got an email saying we were upgraded on the 2nd leg from Singapore to Manila. I called and was told we were not upgraded on the London Manila leg as Business class was full. I told the CS rep that we did not need Business class for a 3 hour flight and requested a refund, the lady went to ask her supervisor who then told us company policy was no refunds. We went from being a happy customer to a very unhappy one. The food was the same as all other airlines, nothing memorable. The in flight staff were great. We are disabled. Very average service. Much better on our usual carrier, Qatar Airways. We had a bad experience 7 years ago with SQ and swore never to fly them again. I wish we had kept to that decision."
2022-04-18,1,1,"""service has been downgrade""",✅ Trip Verified | The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour. I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available (even if they claim they are on the website).
2022-04-08,1,1,"""Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total""",✅ Trip Verified | I just had the worst experience at Paris CDG Airport. Their baggage weight policies are insane. I was in Nairobi then Paris coming from NY. Decided to extend through Singapore heading to Hanoi. I have been allowed 50lbs (about 23kgs) by every airline but Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total and they tried to charge me $700 for about 16 extra kgs. I ended up arguing with them and took some stuff out of my and stuck it in my jacket and carry on.
2022-04-07,8,8,"""unreasonable pricing policy changes""","✅ Trip Verified | Onboard service, food, seats, and entertainment are good. Sudden and unreasonable pricing policy changes? Totally annoying. During corona, SQ sold Economy (lite/value/standard) Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) tickets with certain terms and conditions for each class. Economy Lite offered what I needed: (1) lowest fare, (2) 25kg check in, (3) ability to change parts of the trip (before use) without additional fees, if whole return ticket price was similar/cheaper as original ticket. Changing ticket worked fine, and made me very happy with my purchase. However, since travel restrictions in Singapore have been relaxed, SQ has changed their pricing policies without notice (as in their small letters). Now they charge you unreasonable for a ticket price change: (1) Flight leg you want to change, (2) Look at one-way ticket prices for that leg of your trip (rather than whole ticket prices, as before), (3) your full trip fare that you paid, is then deducted from the one-way ticket price (which is often double that of a new return ticket on similar dates), (4) you're asked to pay the remaining difference in order to change your ticket."
2022-04-06,1,1,"""Service was all over the place""",✅ Trip Verified | There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight.
2022-04-06,1,1,"""Impossible to change my booking online""",✅ Trip Verified | The aircraft and the crew are so nice. People are helpful and very kind. But the customer service is honestly the worst I've ever seen. Impossible to change my booking online. I was in Thailand impossible to contact them. They do not answer mails or phone. I would never fly again with them.
2022-04-05,10,10,"""very kind, helpful and caring""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew today 5th April 2022 on the 1500 flight and the cabin crew were more than fantastic! They were very kind, helpful and caring. I would definitely travel with them again as this was one of the best experiences I've had. Well done SQ and keep up the good work!"
2022-04-02,9,9,"""We totally enjoy the flight""","✅ Trip Verified | My wife and me were on our holiday trip to USA and taken SQ32 on 31/3 in SIA business Class seat 15D & F. We are happy with the check in and boarding. It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers (salmons & prawns) were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have, I’ve chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years. Not the cabin crew’s fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful. We totally enjoy the flight in business class especially my wife as this is her first time in business class and she enjoy the new business class seat a lot as she was I totally worried that she could not sleep but the food down seat converted to bed was comfortable for her to sleep in."
2022-03-26,7,7,"""a very friendly service""","✅ Trip Verified | MAN-SIN-SYD-SIN-MAN earlier this month was my first long-haul flights since before the pandemic. I’ve always loved Singapore Airlines, and I still do. Generally, a very friendly service, although I felt that the cabin crew on the MAN-SIN leg were a bit less so. I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn’t. While not quite the uber luxurious SQ of days gone by, I still think they are a great airline. Just fix up the catering, especially."
2022-03-20,6,6,"""too many business class seats""","Not Verified | A350 from Melbourne to Singapore was in regional configuration and unsuitable for a nearly 8 hour flight. My seat was hard and there are too many in the business class section. Food served to me was in microscopic proportions and there was no drink on boarding. I waited 90 mins for first refreshment. A380 upper deck has many business class seats, some of the windows are obscured, my seat was rock hard though it was bigger and with more storage than previous flight. Long delay to my getting refreshments. Long delay to serving food. I got the impression that there are too many business class seats on the A380 for good service to be possible. In transit at Changi the Krisflyer lounge was packed with nowhere to sit and overheated."
2022-03-12,2,2,"""no inflight entertainment or even music""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Male, no inflight entertainment or even music. No towels, no appetiser and no choice of meal. Coffee/tea was not offered to me. After takeoff 1 toilet was locked for the entire flight until before landing. That usable toilet was filthy after an hour. When booking this route there are 2 flights a day both the same price but the night flight is operated by the A350 which has inflight entertainment. The day flight i took did not. Why the difference when the ticket price is the same? The website should prompt the user that this flight has no entertainment. No smiles no friendliness. Whatever happened to the Singapore Girl and A Great Way To Fly?"
2022-03-10,9,9,"""Meal was excellent by any standard""","✅ Trip Verified | First time on SQ business for a very long time so we were excited to see what it was like especially during COVID. Compared to the Qatar the hard product is not as good especially the Q suite. The book the cook worked well with course by course service with the chicken satay as amuse bush. Meal was excellent by any standard as was the service. Where they went above and beyond was when my 2 year old son was feeling unwell, they assisted more than I would ever have hoped for. Flight was a bit more turbulent than normal due to the different route to avoid Russia and the Ukraine. The flight landed late due to a headwind. Luggage was out by the time we cleared immigration. Only downside was the lack of a touchscreen and selection of shows was not as good as I remembered."
2022-02-24,6,6,"""happy with a Continental breakfast""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Bangkok to Melbourne via Singapore. Singapore to Melbourne flight, SQ237. Seated in 63H, towards the back. The flight was full, the first day the Australian border was open. The boarding procedure at Changi Airport Terminal 3. Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport. A cheerful and informative crew, attentive to people's needs, even in Economy. The plane interior is pleasant, it was clean. The inflight entertainment was all right. OK, the food. Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn't fit for consumption. I'm a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I'm not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken. It wasn't great, too much vermicelli and not enough sauce, but it was adequate. An hour or so later, a senior hostess came and chatted with me, and asked me what was wrong, I described the egg, she said someone else had also complained, I thanked her for asking me. I had an extremely good Nasi Lemak going up to Bangkok from Singapore on January 8th with Scoot, so the Changi kitchens can produce good food, and needless to say Singapore is famous for its food. Please SQ, don't serve food which doesn't pass muster. At 5am Singapore Time most of us would be quite happy with a Continental breakfast. A roll, a croissant, jam and butter, a bit of pineapple, a yoghurt. Early days, we are all finding our feet. Like a lot of SQ travellers I am fond of the airline, and look forward to them hitting their stride soon.t"
2022-02-08,3,3,"""No salad or cheese""","✅ Trip Verified | The check in was excellent given the fact it was during the pandemic. Took off on time. The movies need to be updated more frequently. My food was a let down and portions are very small. From Singapore to Sydney ( 8+ hours) we were given one meal which included a rice noodles with seafood, ice cream and a bread roll. No salad or cheese and crackers. No pre arrival meal was given. No hot towels on both flights and my wifi never worked. However the staff were very polite and courteous."
2022-01-25,1,1,"""trying to get in touch with Singapore Airlines""",✅ Trip Verified | I booked to go to Thailand on the 16/12/21 From Manchester but my wife had a positive covid test so we couldn't fly. I have been trying to get in touch with Singapore Airlines but I am just being ignored. Tried phoning the help line but gave up after 1 3/4 hours. I booked directly with the airline in case something like this happened but it hasn't made any difference.
2022-01-18,3,3,"""all they would refund were the taxes""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agent's line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days. We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones. When we returned we found that all they would refund were the taxes. Sent a letter by post to the corporate headquarters. One month later no response, not even an acknowledgment of receipt."
2022-01-14,3,3,"""seats are a step back in quality""","✅ Trip Verified | I've got to say that my experience flying Melbourne – Singapore and Singapore – Melbourne have completely turned me off Singapore Airlines. Their new fit outs of their A350s have reduced the seat pitch and the seats are a step back in quality. The cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed. The seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space. These new seats negate SIA from being a feasible selection as an airline for me. Thankfully the plane from Singapore to Manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the Melbourne – Singapore update is. The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments. It took them 3 hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin. The whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by bean-counters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff, and ultimately an experience that is a shade of SIA's glory days pre-pandemic."
2022-01-12,3,3,"""Only 1 meal was served on the flight""","Not Verified | Quality of food and beverage has dropped off significantly compared to usual business class offering. Only 1 meal was served on the flight and we were asked to choose whether to have it as dinner upon departure or breakfast prior to arrival. The meal was very average. In the morning they didn't even have yoghurt or cereal to offer to the kids. Both children, age 3 and 5, were in BC also. Very disappointing for an airline of such calibre."
2021-12-30,4,4,"""the food was an utter disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | Trying to contact them by the call center is a nightmare with a lack of customer service and inefficient. The seats on this aircraft were the new regional business class seats which are not bad. The IFE is also good and we had 100MB free wifi which was nice. The crew were good. However, the food was an utter disaster. For a 7 hour flight, we were given 1 miserable meal which was rubbery eggs and mashed-up vegetables. Book the cook was not functioning on this sector so we had no other choice. No welcome drink either. Standards have gone down drastically from many aspects."
2021-12-28,4,4,"""really disappointed with the meals""",✅ Trip Verified | The boarding went on very smooth. The seat was very comfortable and had enough legroom. I was really disappointed with the meals. I chose the lemon chicken with fried rice. It was a very small portion. No salad was offered. The bread roll was in plastic packet cold and dry. The chocolate cake for dessert was okay. Usually flights between the east coast of Australia and Asia they offer a main meal and a pre arrival meal but on this trip no pre arrival meal was given. I feel like SQ is trying to save money by doing this. The IFE was good. Overall I won't be flying with them in the future.
2021-12-24,2,2,"""needs to treat it's customers with respect""","✅ Trip Verified | We booked return flights from London to Singapore with a guarantee of unlimited complimentary changes. Due to COVID we could not travel in Nov 2021 and want to move the flight to Oct 2022. Online, it is impossible to move the flight to any date later than 12 months from the date that the booking was made. Calling Customer Service is tortuous! My partner has made three calls. Each time she has waited approximately two hours to speak to an agent. Each time she has been told that they have to make the change manually but then when the agent tries to action the change, they are unable to do so, refer to a manager and then promise to call back. They don't call back. This is totally unacceptable! On the latest call, my partner asked to speak to somebody more senior than the agent she had been speaking to. In the process of transferring the call, she was cut off. Nobody has called back. My partner is not so stressed and upset about this matter that I have taken over dealing with the airline. We don't have time to waste on the phone trying to resolve this. A five-star airline needs to treat it's customers with respect from the day of booking until the end of the flight. It's not all about the flight and service (or lack of it) prior to the day of travel needs to form part of an airline's overall score. Singapore Airlines are not worthy of your award at the moment."
2021-12-22,9,9,"""kind to refund me fully""","✅ Trip Verified | I had to cancel my flight due to suddenly tightened quarantine requirement set by Hong Kong government, from 14 days to 21 days. Upon my return and have to pay by myself. I wrote an email to the customer service to request for a refund, they got back to me under 3 days by a personal phone call. Although the condition of my ticket was non refundable, they were so kind to refund me fully. It was processed immediately, with an email to confirm as well it. Such kindness and consideration during this difficult period for traveling is much appreciated. So glad to have been a loyal customer to this airline (I'm a Gold Kris flyer). I do hope to fly again with them when the situation improved."
2021-12-22,2,2,"""flights themselves were rather unremarkable""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight was booked at a time when the Covid situation was still looking better and the chance to be be able to leave Changi airport during a long layover looked good. That face with Singapore Airlines flexibility claim of change of flights on their website, made me booking a flight with a 16h layover. Unfortunately, things were not looking good about a month ago, and I tried to change my flights to a short layover. I tried to contact SQ via its change of flight form for Covid related reasons through their website. 5 requests over the span of a month remain unanswered till today, complaint emails were also not replied to. I also tried to contact SQ through their callcenter, was placed in a loop for hours. After getting through after days of trying, I was told that there were seats available for the same booking class and I would be informed once the the ticket would be re-issued. So far so good. An hour later I was called, saying that this „special fare ticket“ can only be changed if if I pay this and that in addition, which ended up to a ridiculous amount, and I declined. So I was back to square and had to endure a 16h stay at Changi airport. SQ does not honor their claim of ticket flexibility. Other carrier I flew during the pandemic were willing honor their flexibility claims. The flights themselves were rather unremarkable, not as polished as Qatar, with no dining on demand offered. Food was average to say the least. No touchscreen TV and average seat on the really noisy 777ER on the long flight. Overall due to the non existing customer service on the ground, not recommended"
2021-12-17,10,10,"""It is still a great way to fly""","✅ Trip Verified | Due to the pandemic, it has been two years since I boarded a flight. When the opportunity arose to travel to Germany under the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme, I booked a round trip to Frankfurt. The business class product still retained its high quality in terms of attentive service from the cabin crew. I had ordered my meals from book the cook option and lunch was promptly served shortly after take off. Being a day flight, the cabin crew came around to convert the seats to bed mode. I managed to get some good sleep until dinner was served some 3 hours prior to landing. In terms of hardware, gone were the physical menus. Instead, an online menu was available. Pre-departure drinks were no longer being served to avoid unnecessary contact with passengers. However, meals were still served course by course like pre-pandemic times. Overall, SQ’s business class product has maintained its quality despite the pandemic. It is still a great way to fly."
2021-12-03,5,5,"""poor design of business class""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying in the worst of times as Omircon had just been detected, yet despite all the restrictions and requirements to fly to Indonesia, Singapore Airlines on its own was not a good choice for a long flight. I had flown SA for many short hauls in Asia, but the discomfort on this trip was due to the routing, the business class set-up, the time in which this route took off, and the poor communication that is truly what SA seems to thrive on, the latter being years of frustration with flying with them; One can never get a person to speak with whether in Asia, NYC or LA. I had over 400K miles therefore I was getting award tickets, in business class, which I have flown for over 40 years consistently. The only ticket available for mileage went through Frankfurt, which meant I had to leave the plane (after 6 hours, middle of the night, but too early in Europe to have any of the lounges open), go through transit and feel like a zombie. (thank you Canada Air for being open and having showers!) But let's talk about the poor design of business class and lack of comfort. These were not staggered seating, so there was no privacy, the ""bed"" could not be done by mere mortals pushing buttons, its construction was convoluted and byzantine, such that an attendant had to physically configure the flat bed and mattress etc. So uncomfortable, as one had to contort oneself to actual fit the length. In the staggered layouts they are already at an angle. Any other flat bed can easily go from seat to bed with button pushing. I have flown to Asia and back from the USA no less than 50-60 times in the last decade and the choices of airlines with better routes and greater comfort, such as JAL, Qatar, Cathay and years ago even Malaysia Air. I don't understand why this airline gets such high marks? I know their agenda: to extend their reach and become a premier European carrier. I will continue to fly SA in Asia for very short hauls, but if I decide to go to Vietnam after many months in delightful Indonesia, it will not be on SA. I have other qualms, but let's face it, flying during this particular phase of the pandemic, with non-stop testing, non-stop mask wearing, abbreviated services, and less perks were not enough to make me stop traveling, but I thought, ""Well, I am in good hands"". The flying itself was lovely, (that was 21 hours, not counting stops in Frankfurt + Singapore). Good Grief! I have my return ticket on the same route in 5 months; I'll need my strength to just find out if there will be any other choice. (there wasn't in October)."
2021-12-01,10,10,"""Can't wait to fly Business Class again""","✅ Trip Verified | SQ25, JFK-FRA, in Business. Check in Counter, did not know how to put a Final Destination on my luggage, and instead insisted that it go to FRA, and get rechecked in. Finally a supervisor came over, and showed them how to put my luggage through. Virgin Lounge was nice and comfortable, although few available meal options. Boarding was fast easy, crew came around to take orders, and offer me a blanket. Slim menu choices, with no Don Perignon, but as we are in COVID, I accepted what was offered. Seat was extremely spacious, and comfortable. IFE was a disaster. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008, and 24 November's Flight was a appallingly horrific turnaround from what I've previously experienced. Difficult to use as well. Landed in FRA, and proceeded to next flight. Can't wait to fly Singapore Airlines Business Class again, but on a longer route, and hopefully out of COVID."
2021-11-21,7,7,"""still a good and safe airline""","✅ Trip Verified | FRA to JFK, still a good and safe airline but massive cut downs and not perfect any more. On the first leg one one hand a very nice and helpful crew which was on the other hand not very visible for customers in a very empty plane, only when you asked for something the helped you, then however very friendly. No welcome drink, No amenity kit provided, on both legs. No menus. The flight attendant explained they had only lamb stew or pork belly to offer for dinner. I can eat lamb and I did, but I know many people do not like lamb neither would eat pork; the meal was oK, but definitely not Business Class quality. No vegetarian option. Same thing on the flight back JFK to FRA, only 2 options. On the flight back the crew was more visible. The seats in Business Class are not so comfy as expected but still very good giving you a lot of privacy compared with Lufthansa Business Class. Good entertainment with good classical selection (I am a fan of classical music)"
2021-11-15,1,1,"""their website is too buggy""","✅ Trip Verified | I paid $7200 for a first / business class ticket and their website is too buggy to handle date changes. I just get the error, ""Due to a technical error, we cannot issue your tickets right now. Your credit/debit card hasn’t been charged, although the amount has been put on hold on your card. We’ve requested for your bank to release the hold, which is expected to be processed in a few days. Our reservations office will be in touch with you soon to assist with your booking. For urgent assistance, get in touch with your local Singapore Airlines office. We apologise for the inconvenience"". Their phone service and on-line chat puts you on-hold indefinitely making it impossible to change dates that way. If this isn't resolved before my flight I will need to be a no-show as I have no way of changing/cancelling my flights."
2021-10-17,1,1,"""reduce both the level and quality of service""","✅ Trip Verified | I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines."
2021-10-14,2,2,"""the change would cost 490 USD""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates. The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense. I am about as likely to trust Singapore Airlines again as I am to fly with them."
2021-08-13,3,3,"""I was disappointed with my flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Check in, security check at Frankfurt airport were conducted fast and efficient. Food and drink choice at LH Senator lounge limited due to Covid restrictions. Boarding of this empty 12h flight organized and uneventful. No pre departure drink offered, only after I’ve asked twice. No menus handed out, no Book the Cook online order of meals offered. The meals on offer were basically Economy meals served on China instead of plastic. The flight attendant was not able to tell me what types of wine were available. She even tried to convince me that a Chablis is a red wine. Everything was served on one tray. All those service shortcomings were explained as ""hygienic precautions"". The seat is very wide, but it’s hard to find a comfy seating position, and padding was insufficient. What really made me upset was the all nigh chit-chatting of the staff in the pantry. I know it was a long empty night flight, but please do not rob me of my sleep. This was not the first time I’ve experienced this on SQ. Transfer in Changi was chaotic, with passengers of each connecting flight being herded in long lines (nobody cared about social distancing here) before being escorted to their next flight. I’ve been on a long haul Qatar Airways flight a couple of weeks ago, and there was no compromise in services, and the staff was disciplined as always during the night flight. I was disappointed with my SQ flights after I have not been flying them for some time. I think some of their competitors are already ahead of them; so it’s high time for SQ to pull up their socks."
2021-05-24,1,1,"""frustrating experience trying to book a flight""","Not Verified | I've never had a more frustrating experience trying to book a flight .. website saying unable to proceed, customer service tell me to keep trying different flights until one works. Then several credit cards declined. Customer service tell me to send an email, they say they'll call me back .. never do. Absolute frustrating mess!"
2020-12-15,10,10,"""the staff were outstanding""","✅ Trip Verified | Excellent flights, and the staff were outstanding. Both flights were very empty, which added to the comfort level - I had an entire row to myself, and most rows around me were empty too. Nonetheless, it would have still been comfortable even if full - seats were spacious, with excellent legroom, and plenty of storage space in the seatback. The IFE was good - a varied selection of movies and TV shows, and the screen was large and high quality. Meals were all good - in particular the fried carrot cake was one of the best economy class meals I've eaten! My only gripe would be that there was no alcohol service beyond what came with the meals: usually they would do a drinks run before meals, and then offer top-ups during the meal service. This time the only drinks were offered with the meal. I suspect this may be due to Covid-19, in order to minimise interaction: it wasn't a problem, as crew were always responsive to my requests. What really made the flight were the crew: they were so friendly, attentive, warm and welcoming. This must be a difficult time for them to work, yet they were all wonderful. Additionally, I felt the Covid-19 prevention measures were good and well enforced."
2020-11-30,10,10,"""staff on these flights were fantastic""","✅ Trip Verified | We have flown with many airlines on various routes worldwide and this was the first time I have flown with Singapore Airlines since having children. The whole experience was second to none, absolutely fantastic. The flight from London was packed and yet the staff were VERY attentive, helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much to ask. On a much quieter flight from Singapore to New Zealand the staff were just as fantastic. Staff always make or break the experience but the staff on these flights were fantastic and an asset to Singapore air. Thank you for such a great experience. With all the covid regulations, the transfer was seamless, with a great area for the children to lay during our layover. Changi airport was a good experience even with most of it closed! We will be flying with you again!"

Very poor customer service and communication. March 23, 2020: SQ emailed me that my flight was cancelled due to Covid-19 situation. April 5: I wrote back ""I would like to get a refund for my ticket. Pls revert."" My intention was to ask what was the refund amount and was expecting them to revert. April 7: No response from SQ. April 14: SQ refunded the ticket without confirming the amount. As a First-Class passenger and there are only 4 first class seats in the flight to LAX, SQ could, in the very least, confirm with me the refund amount and obtain my consent before refund. And after I disputed the refund amount as being unreasonably low (not enough for me to buy another one-way first-class ticket back), they should have the courtesy to handle the communication with the customer better and in a more timely manner. So, I have requested for a reinstatement of my ticket instead of the refund on by emailing and calling customer service of SQ on June 5 and got a reply on June 30 that still under investigation. Current status as of Aug 20, it has been one and a half months and still no reply from SQ."
2020-10-17,1,1,"""I don’t like being taken advantage of""","Not Verified | Inflating fares to rip off passengers during covid. My flight for December 2020 has been cancelled but SIA are offering a voucher for the fare already paid plus £40 to be used to make a new reservation costing anything from £300 - £1,00 extra on top of what I’d already paid. I’m really surprised Singapore Airlines are profiteering from loyal passengers in this way. Surely as one of the leading airlines in the world they should be offering to reschedule flights when there is availability but at no additional fare difference cost. I enjoy the service they provide but I don’t like being taken advantage of / ripped off and I will remember this smoke & mirrors con trick the next time I book a flight."
2020-10-12,1,1,"""they made us occupy all 3 seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Melbourne to Singapore flight was good. There were many passengers in the plane but at least we were one seat apart. Some even had the whole row just for themselves which gave them more space from others. But the transit flight, Singapore to Manila, was unacceptable, it was jam packed and most of us were given seats alongside others whom we did not know. In a 3-seat row, they made us occupy all 3 seats hence, social distancing protocol was not followed when they should have been more careful. We asked the flight attendant he told us we were wearing a face mask and face shield so it should be okay. Please note that ratings below are only based on our flight from Singapore."
2020-09-24,8,8,"""Overall, I was pleased""","✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying on Singapore Airlines, and unlikely to be my last. The service was pretty straightforward: efficient, smooth, procedural, orderly, helpful. I would say that they're more efficient than friendly, though. Singapore check-in and gate staff at Changi were quite pleasant and friendly, but on-flight staff were neither rude nor friendly. Hey, I'm fine with professionalism, as long as it's not done in a curt or rude way (I'm looking at you, most North American airlines!) Check-in at Changi, an automated breeze done in the new Jewel section. The plane and lavatories were clean. The meal was pretty good for economy class, and entertainment options were just fine for a 3.5-hour flight. Most importantly, our flight arrived into a very quiet Hong Kong Airport early. Overall, I was pleased."
2020-09-01,2,2,"""buy a new and very expensive ticket""","✅ Trip Verified | Because the travel office where I bought the ticket turned insolvent, Singapore Airlines declared all issued tickets of them as invalid. This is why I had to buy a new and very expensive ticket at Changi Airport directly by Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines however did not inform me about the cancellation of the plane ticket, nor did the check-in hotline inform me about the current situation. I am more than dissatisfied because they decline any responsibility and the information provided by the complaints office does not answer the questions at all."

For the initial weeks they were telling me that a cash refund could not be offered and I could only re-book or be offered credit towards booking another flight. After three weeks they then decided to officially cancel my flight (due to take off in early May) and agreed to process a refund. It has now been three months since I initially requested a cash refund via my travel agent and there appears to have been no movement from the airline. I have received time dated copies from my travel agent getting in contact with Singapore Airlines in early April and they have received no communication from the airline has been received thus far despite me being told by an advisor at the airline confirming that they had been in touch with the travel agent to issue the refund, this was around a month ago."

Funny story the airline website indicate the plane were full where you can't select another economy seats, and pushes you choose at the end of the tail close to lavatory. Even when you're boarded the plane when clearly no people, they weren't let you sit on the same economy coach that were empty. I have to asked 3 times to asked them to move my seat (where less than 50 people on that flight) in such a big plane, which eventually they did it. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this midnight flight and had the whole row for myself."
2020-06-10,8,8,"""I enjoyed their Boeing 787""","✅ Trip Verified | Bali Denpasar to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. I was looking forward to flight with SQ after a while. Although the current situation due to global pandemic got me bit worried to kept flying for this holiday. Since it wasn't a cancelled flight/ route, I decided to carry on. The flight for DPS-SIN were rather full and I enjoyed their Boeing 787. It was a short flight and dinner were served during the flight was delightful. We had a quick layover in Singapore for my connecting flight to Tokyo with A380. I sat on lower deck and the plane was merely full. They gave us light meal before turndown service, however a mistake was made by the cabin crew as they gave me a wrong food that am allergic too (I've never requested). I got sick during the flight. They kept apologise to me and one of the senior crew came to approach. They offered me a doctor service upon arrival in Narita which I refused. I got slightly better, but it shouldn't be happen. Despite of the allergic reaction due to their service, overall I was still able to enjoy the trip. It was just hindering me to give them a perfect score."
2020-05-29,8,8,"""the flight was very pleasant""","Not Verified | Singapore to Taipei in December 2019. The meal was a seafood pasta. The pasta tasted fishy, lacked flavor and was almost soggy. The service from the crew was top-quality, and the toilet was jam-packed with amenities which I really liked. The in-flight entertainment system has much to choose from and could easily keep you pre-occupied for the whole of the flight duration. Overall, the flight was very pleasant but the meal could’ve been much better."

I was visiting family and friends and with COVID-19 I found it hard to leave. I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you weren't allowed to enter Singapore airport if you've been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just beforey, so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didn't have a choice of accepting that money or not. I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now they're saying they can't help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation. Whereas I know and should've had the right to receive flight credits instead for a flight back to Sydney."

Conditions then were: free changes to itinerary. Itinerary was subsequently re-ticketed on Mar 16 due to evolving situation. Departure postponed to May. Now they want to give neither a refund nor flight credits, available to customers who had booked prior to Mar 15, because my ticket was re-issued literally minutes after 0000 hrs, 16 March. I am told again and again to wait. As for what, I am not sure. In the meantime, the route has been canceled for the month of May and Ctrip has not contacted me about my itin."

Singapore Airlines does not give you full refunds or vouchers should they decide. In my case they stated that they have adopted a new travel restriction earlier than the Thailand government required and, thus, would have to seek some other transport. Today 03.04 they also confirmed a hefty cancellation/no-show fee would be deduced."
2020-04-03,1,1,"""there was a fare difference""","✅ Trip Verified | Da Nang to Perth via Singapore. Had to bring my flights home forward by 2 days due to border shutdowns and Government advice re corona virus. Charged me an extra $520AUD to do so despite having a far longer layover in Singapore. Claim that there is no rebooking charge, but there was a fare difference."
2020-04-02,1,1,"""justify charging customers""","Not Verified | Due to the corona virus out break we decided to travel home 6 days early out of a 28 day holiday in Penang, we contacted SIA regarding a change to our flight who informed us we would have to pay 1350RM per person a total of 2700RM. After booking the flight we received an email saying the flight was cancelled with no explanation other than to ring one of there offices in Penang or KL this was at 18.15 there offices close at 17.30. I feel that Singapore Airlines are taking advantage of passengers trying to return home how can they justify charging customers for wanting to return home early. My opinion is 2700RM was an exorbitant price to have pay for a change to flights tickets also the both flights had spare seats when we boarded the flights. We will be returning to Penang when this crises is over but as frequent flyers on Singapore Airlines we will be looking at other airlines."

On our connecting flight, we almost missed the plane for Singapore to Manila. Running and running, after we landed at Singapore from Kuala Lumpur of SilkAir.

Won't give refund so that we can source other options, only credit for future flights. Unreachable via phone. Can't log on to site at all now. Phone number states not in service. I understand they must be overwhelmed with queries, but feeling totally abandoned and just want a refund so I can find another way home."
2020-03-29,1,1,"""I never expected such behavior from SQ""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight was canceled by Singapore Airlines due to Corona Virus. No transit in SIN possible anymore. They simply cancelled my flights and gave no helping hand to re-book etc. I am booked in Business Class. No refund was granted, only to keep the ticket open for one year. They informed me that if I re-booked to a later flight, a fare difference might appear and I would have to pay on top. This is unbelievable. First they deny any refund, which all other airlines grant, now I also have to pay on top if I re-book to another date. As a frequent traveler and Gold Card Member of Star Alliance, I never expected such behavior from SQ. I strongly suggest not to tolerate such a customer unfriendly style. For me and my company, SQ is not anymore in the traveling list. We will prefer LH/TG going to Europe, and to the US. I am very sorry to write these lines, but other fellow travelers should be aware. By the way the way to get an answer from SQ might take 15-20 days."
2020-03-26,9,9,"""crew were friendly and efficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. This was our first time flying Premium Economy and my expectation was for Singapore Airlines was to provide an exceptional experience. Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good, the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noise-cancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they weren't at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it, there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I don't like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience. Two things, ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal."

I was confirmed on the morning 9.20am flight. However I received a email that evening that my flight for the next day morning was cancelled. Immediately there was no line, only you got to email. I have no choice but make it the next day for the night flight 20.20. And true enough that morning there isn't any public transport, no taxi that day. I get the Hotel reception to assist. Upon check & reaching home, I learnt to appreciate our Singapore Airlines. They did it. I feel secure upon reaching the Jakarta Airport. A big thank you to Singapore Airlines. ."

2020-03-23,9,9,"""an excellent experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore. Due to the coronavirus crisis I had to bring my flight forward by five weeks. Once I got through to it, the call centre's staff were efficient in getting me suitable flights. Check-in at Haneda was friendly and quick. The ANA lounge was comfortable with a great view of the runway, although food and drink options were limited due to antivirus precautions. The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinese-style vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty, but the Indian-style vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive, with little curry and a lot of bread. There were several drinks rounds on both flights. I managed to get a good sleep on a comfortable long bed. Both flights arrived slightly early. All in all, an excellent experience."

Now with all the travel bans/restrictions due to Corona virus I needed to cancel the three tickets we booked. I cannot reach a ticketing agent on the phone, answering machine tells you to ring again. and again, again to no avail. The ticketing office in Zurich has been shut for a week with a leaflet on the door telling you, you guessed it the number where no-one is home. I sent an online form to which I got an email telling me that they will respond after 7 working days, that means they will get back to me after my scheduled flight would have taken place."

The A380 cabin was clean and did not look to be very old at all. Range of entertainment options was great. 2 meals served and had vegetarian which were both fine. Plenty of water offered and the crew were polite and professional. Despite news to the contrary, there were hot towels and blankets and pillows!"

Happy to fly on their wide body Boeing 777-200 which offer a better product. I find the seats on their old B777-200 more comfortable and better padded than their newer planes. The food and crew were amazing. Overall a great way to fly."
2020-02-28,5,5,"""gave me a hard time with baggage""","✅ Trip Verified | Ahmedabad to San Francisco via Singapore. The overall in-cabin experience was fine, however, the check-in experience at the Ahmedabad airport was horrible. The staff gave me a hard time with baggage. It took 2 hours and standing in the check-in line three times to get my boarding passes. They weighed the personal bag and made fuss about the weight being 0.2 kgs over in one bag while it was 0.3 kgs under in another bag. I was told that the personal bag, which happened to be my laptop bag, cannot have anything else but the laptop and laptop accessories. I asked them if there was a scale I can use to distribute/adjust the weight across all my luggage pieces and they did not know or were not bothered to find out. Each time I had to go through bag screening and stand in long lines to find out that I still need to balance out 0.1 or 0.2 kgs of weight between my bags. While I was going through this ordeal, the staff is trying to sell me upgrade to business class in spite of telling him no once. I do have to mention that I flew Singapore airlines from SFO to Ahmedabad on Jan 27th 2020 and did not have a similar experience with luggage at the San Francisco airport. Given the coronavirus outbreak, I wish the in-cabin staff had some masks on hand to distribute to passengers requesting it. All of them were wearing it and when I asked for one, they said they do not have any."

2020-02-27,1,1,"""I am USD 100 out of pocket""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Zurich. A few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket. Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection. However, now that they changed my next itineraries I don't hear them talking about them paying a change fee to me. It is not OK to change and provide an inferior itinerary for the same price for any customer."
2020-02-26,7,7,"""no dedicated crew in premium economy""","Not Verified | This was the daylight flight from Singapore to Johannesburg. Check in and boarding was, as is usual quick and efficient, with a friendly welcome from the crew. There are no pre-flight drinks offered in premium economy. Drinks are offered after take off, including French Champagne, but in tiny plastic tumblers. We had utilized “book the cook”, which had a large range of options, but these are served in an economy format, which nullifies any special qualities. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy, with the result that is approximately an hour before trays are removed and drink refills are available. The flight was good, the entertainment system excellent. The crew came round often with water and fruit juice, and a second meal was served before arrival. Overall this was a good flight with excellent hard product, excellent economy class service, but not up to the standard expected for premium economy. Why do Singapore Airlines not commit to a proper Premium Economy service?"

The plane was quiet and the Skybed came to good use as I slept more than 8 hours. In business class, we are greeted by name and the air crew were friendly and professional.

2020-02-23,3,3,"""given a very generic meal""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Colombo via Singapore business class. Left on Jan 27 2020 from LAX and returned Feb 21 2020. At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called 'book the cook' which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX. Sorry Singapore airlines you are no longer the top 'dog' in the business. I will think twice before going with you again."
2020-02-22,9,9,"""Overall a great flightW","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Singapore Airlines Jakarta to Singapore and back. It’s still a great airline to fly. Seats was still 9 abreast on 777. Food was great. Entertainment was great, but it’s limited compared to Emirates or Qatar Airways but still acceptable. Price was expensive a bit but still worth it. Return flight in the A350 was more greater than this flight. Overall a great flight with SQ and will fly with them again."
2020-02-22,1,1,"""refused give me refund""",✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. The check in experience is the worst. I request for aisle seat and I got the window seat. I cancel my Russia Holiday with Singapore Airlines they refused give me refund.
2020-02-21,1,1,"""my seat had a broken table""","✅ Trip Verified | Siem Reap to Kolkata via Singapore. We chose Singapore as we had heard lots of wonderful things about the airline. Our experience was worse than any bucket-shop airlines and we thought Singapore was a world standard airline. On the Siem Reap to Singapore Route my seat had a broken table which I was informed only on the way to the boarding the flight when I was suddenly being pressurised by their ground staff. Although I was waiting at the airport near the gate for over an hour none of your ground staff bothered to discuss this matter with me. Furthermore the table was only secured with sticky tape which kept falling on my lap and on a couple of occasions fell on my watch! We then received further shoddy service from ground staff at Singapore on the Kolkata flight. Having paid USD 700+ for our one-way ticket from REP to CCU I was shocked to be downgraded to an airline with filthy seats, no TV, no leg space and in general badly in need of an uplift. To cap it all the cabin staff offered me gifts worth SGD 75 on the plane. This offer got progressively downgraded to a few miles on their airline."
2020-02-20,9,9,"""superior customer service""","Not Verified | Manila to London via Singapore. The usual Singapore airlines efficient boarding process using boarding groups on both flights. The seats on the 777 are more comfortable than those on the (refitted) A380. A pity because seat comfort is a priority on a thirteen and a half hour flight. To be honest, the old A380 seats were more comfortable than the new but the new look better. Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley. In my view, they still beat the competition, mainly down to their superior customer service so I will continue to use them. The transit experience at Changi is also a big positive."

I personally prefer to look for a ticket with Singapore Airlines first before any other airlines unless it's a direct flight. there is no direct service between Brisbane and Ho Chi Minh so I was excited about my flight home with Singapore Airlines. Very friendly and efficient ground service. Cabin crew is the among the nicest. Always up for your request. Food quality has gone down as compared to the past. However, drink game is up from offering cocktails and liquor for economy class. I thought I would enjoy the A350-900 more but turned out I like the Boeing 787-10 better. Too bad that the flight with 787-10 was too short. Overall, Singapore Airlines will still remain my top choice if I have to book a flight."
2020-02-10,3,3,"""the biggest disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | Copenhagen to Denpasar via Singapore. I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll. Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since ""it was not in the menu card"" I was told. Very strange. On the return flight to Copenhagen the entertainment was slightly better but the food and beverage was far below the standard you get elsewhere like Qatar Airlines. The experience with Singapore Airlines was the biggest disappointment I have had since very long."

I am about 180 cm and i still had around 10 cm space left on my knee. The inflight entertainment system was old school, but the channel and contents were up to date. The crew were very nice. The meal was okay, i had this fried noodle with beef served with bun and some fruits. There were always lot of different beverage options on Singapore Airlines which is actually great. It was a short route to Singapore and i did really enjoy the flight. Singapore to Seoul Boeing 787-10. B787-10 legroom was a bit shorter but still enough for 180 cm man like me. But the arm rest gap was a bit narrow. The configuration was 3x3x3 and i sat on the middle and two other passengers sat on my right and left side. It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and. The cabin was clean and the most interesting of this aircraft that the window shades was electric by dimming the windows colour. It was nice! This was my first time flying with Boeing 787-10 and i still like A380 or A330 better compared to this aircraft."

We departed our flight from Ho Chi Minh City and were on our way to catch our next flight to Los Angeles, when we realized that we had left our Iphone 11 on the plane. The phone was left in the compartment facing the seat. We immediately went to Lost and Found and explained that situation and also informed our agent at the the gate. There was more than enough time for them to have searched the plane before our departure. Unfortunately, we never received any word from the airline. We also filled out paperwork in Los Angeles and we tried contacting Singapore Airlines on many occasions and did not receive one reply. Such a disappointment, the airlines doesn't have the decency to correspond. For an airlines that has such great reviews they definitely lack in common courtesy."
2020-02-04,7,7,"""has dramatically improved""","✅ Trip Verified | Busan to Singapore. First of all, the service has dramatically improved since my last trip with SIA. Cabin crews are super friendly, cheerful and serves customer with a big smile. However, the most disappointing part is the attitude of the ground staff in Busan. One of the ground staff was very impatient and does things insincerely. She delays the precious time of my travelmate by asking unnecessary documents as other ground staff does not require it. Another shocking part is the cleanliness situation of the cabin which was quite dirty and not up to SIA's standard. There were coffee stains on the tray table and the cupholder of the seat. However, the cabin crew was responsive and quickly cleaned the stain for lunch. Food was OK and when I did not finish my food, the cabin crew did asked for feedback and offered me other options which is something I appreciate. Despite the disappointment of the cleanliness and attitude of the ground staff, the cabin crew's attitude actually made my day."

I asked for a letter showing I was not allowed to check in - nothing to do with my behaviour, condition etc. Singapore Airlines wrote to me to say I was a ""no show"" not that there was any problem checking-in."
2020-01-20,5,5,"""ran out of certain dishes""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Singapore was the biggest let down. Okay food but they ran out of certain dishes during the first service run. Service on this flight was understandably rushed due to its 2-hours duration. But it was also terrible. I ordered post-meal drink and notes were taken but they forgot about me. I requested the drink again, but was told too late the bar is closed. We pay premium for business class partly to enjoy the amenities including F&B. Running out of certain dishes and forgetting to serve a drink renders this as a wasted expense and for that we currently do not recommend this airline."

I had changed to my flight two times because of a cyclone in my country and the airline was very hospitable and they changed my flights without picking up a fuss about it and they did it for free. Check in at Denpasar was very friendly, the staff happily gave me a window seat and once on board, I was amazed, the plane was new and was extremely comfortable. I can't wait to fly with them again in future."
2020-01-17,10,10,"""seat was really comfortable""","Paris to Singapore. Singapore Airlines upheld its excellent standard on this flight. The ground experience was smooth, although the gate was a pretty far walk. The flight was very comfortable and enjoyable. Two meals were served - lunch and breakfast, and both we just delicious. The cabin crew were friendly and provided excellent service. The IFE was easy to use and pretty responsive, and also had a very wide variety of movies. The seat was really comfortable for a Premium Economy seat. It was wide, had more than sufficient legroom and had good recline."
2020-01-17,8,8,"""Service was good""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Newark return with family. Cannot say that I was looking forward to spending 17-19 hours on an aircraft, however the time passed very quickly indeed and would recommend Singapore Airlines and this route if wanting to access the US east coast. Service was good, and premium economy seats were comfortable. Used the book the cook option and the food was okay - there is also lots of snack available in the galley when you want. The IFE is one of the better ones on the market, with a decent touchscreen and good selection of movies and TV shows. I booked one of the seats at the rear of the cabin which is by itself and this is certainly worth while doing. Overall, it was recommended and would take this option again to NYC from Singapore. The flight goes far quicker than you would think."
2020-01-16,1,1,"""the gate was closed""",✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. The flight was delayed and when we reached the gate was closed and we were advised that the gate is changed. We had to walk to the other side of the airport and sat there for an hour. When we were boarding we were advised that this is a different flight number (same airline and destination though). We were checked in 2 hours prior to the flight time but were never paged us or looked for us. Just took the luggage out of the flight. They advised us that the next flight is full also and we will need to wait till the next day for another flight as well as having to pay penalty.
2020-01-15,2,2,"""proceeded to first class check in""",✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Singapore in Economy class. I recently received a status match I am QF platinum and received kris gold. At the airport I proceeded to first class check in (allowed with qf platinum) but did not realise that Kris gold doesn’t provide the same benefit. I was told by the check on supervisor that I was being unfair to other passengers as if I had come to the wrong desk on purpose. She came back again and repeated the same on front of other passengers. The experience was humiliating as I had made a genuine error
2020-01-13,5,5,"""not overly friendly service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Frankfurt. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to Premium Economy on this 13h flight. Something which rarely happens on SQ. The seat was reasonably comfy with plenty of legroom. There were no more menu cards in Premium Economy, something I’ve got even in Y class on the same flight a year ago. Food was ok .. but nothing to shout about. The most disappointing part was the robotic, not overly friendly service. I think the days of the famous “Singapore Girl” are gone. Carrier like Qatar Airways are miles ahead here."
2020-01-12,10,10,"""impressed with the cabin crew""","Not Verified | Flew on Thursday 9th Jan 2020 from Singapore to Brisbane. Endured some turbulence flying out of Singapore for a few hours. I became nauseated and uncomfortable. Staff were very kind and helpful making sure I was looked after. Checked on me numerous times, throughout the flight. Very impressed with the cabin crew and would recommend flying with this airline in the future."
2020-01-10,5,5,"""experience left a bad taste""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Kolkata via Singapore. On my SFO-SIN flight I asked for an extra bread roll/butter at one of the meal times, was given the bread but told ‘sorry, it’s one butter per passenger/tray’!. Then I asked for Chinese tea (instead of what they were taking around) - and was told ‘we don’t have any’. At SFO check-in counter, I stood at the head of the Premium Economy line for 15min as passengers who had come after me were attended to before me. After 3 such times, when I expressed surprise, a lady said I was in the wrong queue for bag drop. I pointed out to her I was not standing for bag drop but check in, after which I was attended to. This was the first time ever that my SQ experience left a bad taste in my mouth, especially given how wonderful it always is, and how warmly I recommend it to everyone specifically for its customer service. It would be very unfortunate if the airline cannot keep up its usual standards."
2020-01-09,10,10,"""very friendly and accommodating""",✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Hanoi via Singapore. The crew were very friendly and accommodating. The food was tasty and well presented. Cannot fault the airline. Singapore Airlines is one of the best I have travelled on in a long time
2020-01-08,9,9,"""another excellent flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London Heathrow. Yet another excellent flight on Singapore Airlines despite flying on the older product. The older A380 was operating this 14-hour flight from Singapore to London but I still enjoyed the seat. My cabin was nearly empty and we could choose whatever seat we wanted. The seat was huge - it had a lot of legroom, width and was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the IFE was not touchscreen and it was not very responsive, which would be expected for a 13-year-old system. There were still a large variety of movies and TV shows in the entertainment system. The crew were friendly, helpful and provided excellent service, they really made the flight enjoyable. The food was absolutely delicious. I could hardly tell the difference between this airline food and food on the ground. We arrived in London on time."
2020-01-07,10,10,"""Amazing staff and food""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Singapore. Dedicated first lounges at Heathrow, Singapore and also Hong Kong, unlike Emirates and Etihad that put first customers with business flyers at some airports. When your paying this much money it’s not acceptable. Amazing staff and food, especially book the cook. We had very turbulent flights and as a nervous flyer they couldn’t have been more caring. Absolutely not a bad thing to say about them apart from the fact that we weren’t on a A380 but 777 which is a horrible plane to fly."
2020-01-07,9,9,"""a great flight with SQ""","✅ Trip Verified | A great experience flying Business Class from Istanbul to Denpasar (Bali) via Singapore. We loved the lie flat beds, although a very warm cabin prevented getting a lot of sleep. F&B service excellent and professionally served by the SQ crew. Love the ""Book the Cook"" service where you can order fine dining meals in advance. Great choice of wines and plenty of champagne refills! My wife can only eat gluten free meals and a small criticism is the lack of gluten free options, WiFi allowance of only 100 Mb in Business Class is rather limited as well. Very smooth transfer in Singapore and Kris Lounge not too crowded. The Turkish Airlines lounge used by SQ at Istanbul Airport is massive and offers an excellent choice of hot Turkish food. All in all, a great flight with SQ and look forward to flying Business Class again with them soon."
2020-01-04,7,7,"""control consumption of alcohol""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Moscow. When we are about to land, a passenger went into toilet, the Male Flight attendant asked him before he went in “can you hold ?” The passenger shook his head &’went in, subsequently the flight attendant talk to us (all the passengers), this kind of people caused landing to delay. After a while the flight attendant went on to knock on the toilet door & shouted to ask the passenger to come out quickly. Moscow - Singapore 2 Jan 2020. The question is that does SIA inform their passengers how much alcohol they can consume ? I heard a female flight attendant said “he has drank a lot” in Mandarin to another flight attendant. Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said “this is a plane not a bar”, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol. SIA has to make a decision, either no alcohol, limited alcohol (informed passengers before booking of tickets) or free flow, find a way to handle it instead of being rude to passengers."
2020-01-03,6,6,"""very difficult to sleep""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Newark. My wife and I were seated in 31A/31C on SQ22. There was a family of five that was too overbearing and inconsiderate (non stop talking from SIN to EWR) during the entire flight. This made it very difficult to sleep even on premium economy. Paying extra $120 each for these seats was a waste of money. The food (including ""Book the Cook"") was not extraordinary. The entertainment selection (movies, music, TV series) was inadequate. I understand that the flight crew needed rest during this long journey. However, not cleaning the toilet bin was unacceptable. I've flown other competitors on Premium Economy (ANA, EVA) and I can attest that the toilets for Premium Economy were kept immaculate during the long legs to either Japan or Taipei. There is something to be said about the passenger treatment when they are not flying Business Class. On a separate flight from MNL to SIN, my wife and I flew SQ on business. The customer service was met. Unfortunately, Premium Economy customers are not treated the same way."
2020-01-01,6,6,"""meals were unappetising""","✅ Trip Verified | Auckland to Singapore. Decided to try premium economy due to extra legroom and slightly wider seats although the additional recline is negligible. These two options were provided but the seat itself was uncomfortable and the much vaunted leg and foot rests are not fit for purpose if you are of average or above average height. I used the facility of “Book the Cook” for two of the four meals provided (return flight) but sadly the meals were unappetising, bland and why is the airline no longer providing salt and pepper? There was only one round of drinks offered so although premium economy is quite a bit more expensive than economy the benefits are small except for the leg space. Also had to use economy toilets which would have been fine except that they were not particularly well maintained but I do admit that both flights were full up so staff would have been kept busy. As usual the flight attendants were beautifully groomed and always polite Very surprised at the lack of variety on the entertainment system"
2019-12-30,8,8,"""Staff were very friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth. Aircraft changed from 777 to A350 in the regional configuration. Boarding was slightly delayed but well managed with priority given to those traveling with children. New A350 which on the regional is still 3x3x3 but a little less space between the seats and no premium economy, actually prefer the cabin colours to the long haul version. Staff were very friendly with the service being first rate and a good selection of meals options. Very pleasant 4.5 hour flight. Flight arrived on-time but due to a medical emergency everyone had to remain seated until the person could be deplaned. This took about 30 min which then meant that due to 2 other flights having landed immigration was chaos,(not SQ fault). Having flown A350 and 787 I can now say that the Airbus is the better plane."
2019-12-29,8,8,"""a really good flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Singapore. Boarding was quick and efficient and the departure was on time. The crew were friendly and visible throughout the flight, a lunch was served a few hours after take-off with a hot breakfast delivered 2 hours before landing. Drinks were brought out every hour to ensure that people stayed hydrated. Plane was clean and so were the bathrooms at least when I used them. As usual a wide selection of entertainment was available. The A350 is a great plane to travel on and SQ has made sure there is plenty of legroom, the storage pockets are great for holding phones instead of having just one big pocket. Once again a really good flight."
2019-12-28,9,9,"""seats were comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore. Great service. The seats were comfortable in business, although they could be less comfortable for a tall person. With the 787s, the space between the seat and the TV monitor is quite narrow and when the table is out, one must sit quite upright. It is not as comfortable as the Airbus or Qatar’s q-suites but definitely way better than 99% of other airlines. I had the lobster thermidor and was happy that this is much better now - tender yet creamy sauce. There are Asian drinks on board, such as umeshu, which is brilliant. Free WiFi was available on board and lasted through my 5 hour flight even with Facebook surfing."
2019-12-27,7,7,"""still an enjoyable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Perth to Singapore in July 2019. Mid-night flight fmainly to see how the 787 compares with the A350. Check-in was smooth save for the issue with them not allowing us to take the travel stroller, which folds into something the size of a briefcase on board as it wasn't in a carry bag? Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch. Breakfast served was good with all options available. Of the 4 legs this was probably the most disappointing from SQ, but still an enjoyable flight."
2019-12-26,8,8,"""Great service""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Bali. Great service, though there was no food choice when the service reached our seat as the other main dish was completely served. Plenty of movie selections with the latest hits."
2019-12-24,7,7,"""my suitcase was damaged""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Hong Kong via Singapore. Until now I have been very happy with SQ and have always preferred it above Cathay Pacific (hence the extra 4 hours in taking these flights instead of the direct flights) The flight was great and nothing to complain .. as a cardholder I had access to the lounge and SQ has been always great in accepting my kids (younger then 12yrs) with me in their lounges. Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct. Anyway suitcase was picked up on Thursday and was told on Saturday afternoon that they couldn't fix it and would offer me 1080HKD (no idea how they came to that amount) and it was a take it or leave it deal. What actually made it worse that up till today I have not received any apologies or even an acknowledgement of damage caused by them."
2019-12-20,10,10,"""shout out a special Thanks""","✅ Trip Verified | Would like to shout out a special Thanks to Caitlyn, air hostess who assisted us in flight SQ494 from Singapore to Dubai. My 4 year old son fell sick during the flight and the team mainly Caitlyn ensured to give us the assistance needed, including getting children's paracetemol which calmed his fever down within the 7 hours. Thanks a lot."
2019-12-17,3,3,"""received budget airline service""","✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Chitose return via Singapore with SIA but the Chitose to Singapore leg was codeshare with Scoot and I was appalled that I for the SIA ticket price I paid, I just received budget airline service. Firstly, I had a party of 4 and they couldn't seat us together. They put us as 2, 1, 1. Then after complaining, they put us as 2, 2. But when I flew off, 3 seats were free right next to us! Secondly, they don't give you a choice of meal. Not to mention the food was barely edible. And they only give a bottle of water. I had to pay for beer or soft drink etc. Given I paid SIA prices which is for full service, you'd think I'd get more service than that."
2019-12-16,3,3,"""delays with boarding""","✅ Trip Verified | Colombo to Sydney via Singapore. I have no complaints about the great cabin crew on the flights. They were hard working and very polite. Our main issues with the delays with boarding, departure and arrivals. We have almost missed connecting flights on 2 occasions. The second one was the trip from Sydney to Singapore. We had a very stressful time changing terminals and walking several hundred metres to the gate when the boarding of the second flight was scheduled to start while we were still on board the 1st flight. I had had recent surgery and literally ran to the gate with my hand luggage. Ground staff are less than helpful as well - boarding using boarding groups is ridiculous- so much confusion and people trying to pass people putting luggage away. Why not call boarding by last few rows at a time rather than a huge boarding group. Staff on the ground disorganised - twice Singapore airlines has lost our luggage and we were left on holidays for a couple of days with no clothes, till we have managed to get our luggage - food was tasteless, surely no one likes the cheese and mushroom mini pies on the Colombo-Singapore leg."
2019-12-16,2,2,"""has disappointed us""",✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Coimbatore via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has disappointed us in the last three trips. The price they charge is so expensive but from Singapore to our destination we get to travel in budget airlines which is Scoot or silk air. It doesn’t make sense at all. When we ask for help they say it’s a different management so we can’t help you further. Moreover there is no special assistance in those low cost airlines. Also the Singapore airport was so warm and the air conditioner was not controlled well across.
2019-12-12,8,8,"""lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue""","Not Verified | Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy. The lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue."
2019-12-11,9,9,"""recent flight with SQ was near flawless""","✅ Trip Verified | I haven’t been flying with SQ for a while and I have to say they have improved a lot. I am not saying my previous SQ flight was bad or awful, it was great but I did feel like they could have improved more. But, my recent flight with SQ was near flawless! It seemed like they had listened to customer’s feedback and made the overall experience better. The most obvious improvement was the IFE system. They employed the newest technology regarding the IFE system, the screen was wide and really responsive to touch. The colors were bright, there were some of the newest released movies available and the available media content (music, video, movies) were more than enough to accompany your whole journey. I didn’t even open my ipad throughout my trip. The seats were redesigned, I felt more comfortable and the leg space was spacious. The food and beverage was even more tastier and ever. At the moment, for me, it is the best airline! It’s not perfect though, I want SQ to outdo themselves and become better overtime. If I could give one suggestion, I would like them to provide wireless connection for the headphones because their in house earphones don’t cut it and most of todays head/earphones are wireless."
2019-12-09,8,8,"""don’t hand out amenity kits""","✅ Trip Verified | We always look forward to flying SQ because the crews are so well-trained and the flight plan/timetable suits us. Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it’s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays. A disappointing cost cutting measure on both flights was that they don’t hand out amenity kits anymore, unless you ask cabin crew for them. But otherwise ok."
2019-12-04,8,8,"""I am still happy with SQ""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Perth, SQ215 is a Boeing 787 that has flat beds in business class. The business class seats lie flat but is rather cramped once the table is out. In terms of comfort, it is ok - not as good as the Airbus used for long haul flights. The compartment for legs is rather narrow, so could be uncomfortable for someone taller who needs to bend his/her knees. The food is good, which maintains the Singapore Airlines standard of food. Service is good. The number of drink services is not as frequent as other flights. Overall, I am still happy with SQ and will fly again."
2019-12-03,8,8,"""Excellent service""","Not Verified | Flew JFK-FRA-SIN vv on SQ25/26 on Premium Economy. Great value overall with airfare at $1000 RT. JFK facilities are subpar in T4 for premium airline - boarding was chaotic with roughly six separate lines outside main gate to handle the double decker flight. Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean, nice orange/grey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat, along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks, dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side, only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFK-FRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRA-SIN, but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV- the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min, no fuss, no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great, T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was non-eventful. Excellent service particularly on FRA-JFK sector (less full) whereas out of SIN was packed. Great experience overall. Would definitely recommend the PremEcon if you keep the fare to less than $1200. Not sure if the value is there if you pay for much more."
2019-12-02,9,9,"""service was generally good""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Tokyo. I chose this particular flight over others of the day to experience SQ new Boeing 787-10. However, it was later changed to an A380. Though this was an old version, the aircraft was well maintained and clean. Singapore Airlines lounge at SIN Terminal 3 was nice but crowded at the time. Boarding was in order, and cabin service was generally good."
2019-12-02,10,10,"""most comfortable experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | Shanghai to Singapore. Shanghai is currently among a few airports that receive SQ updated A380 service. The new suites, only 6 in total that occupy the whole forward section of the upper deck, are spectacular. For comparison, in the same area, Etihad fits 9 spacious Apartments, while Emirates manages to squeeze in 14 First Class Suites. The armchair was very comfortable with thick padding, and the bed was easily the most comfortable I have experienced on a plane. The suite itself was so spacious that I thought I was sleeping in a small hotel room. Meal service was great with a lot of attention to details, though I did not find the food as tasty as on other top first class services, including SQ own old Suites. I probably chose the wrong menu item then (book-the-cook was not available for Shanghai). On the ground, I got access to Air China First Class Lounge, which offered both buffet and a-la-carte dinning, though I did not try those as I was full from a big lunch in Shanghai."
2019-12-02,10,10,"""crew provided excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Shanghai to Singapore. A packed but lovely flight on Singapore Airlines. My seat, 59A, was very wide and comfortable, and had good legroom. The seat was practical and had a lot of compartments for me to store my things. Furthermore, the IFE was responsive and there was a very large variety of movies available. A lunch menu was given to all passengers, which is a great touch to an already good service. Lunch was served on my flight and it was a delicious pork and chicken combination. The crew provided excellent service and promptly provided me with drinks whenever I requested for them."
2019-12-02,9,9,"""had a nice surprise""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I had a nice surprise when I discovered I was boarding an SQ plane rather than a SilkAir one. Service is good like any other SQ flight. The plane was old but whatever, it was only 45 minutes. We had access to the Entertainment but had no earphones, so unable to watch movies properly. There is 1 drink service. Coffee, tea or juice. I am looking forward to SIA decommissioning all SilkAir planes. The service and seats of SQ are way better."
